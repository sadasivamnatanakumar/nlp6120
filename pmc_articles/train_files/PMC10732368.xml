Although previous studies highlighted the contextual effect of kinematics of both arms on internal model formation, we do not know how the sensorimotor control system associates the learned memory with the experienced states in bimanual movements. More specifically, can, and if so, how, does the sensorimotor control system combine multiple states from different effectors to create and adapt a motor memory? Here, we tested motor memory formation in two groups with a novel paradigm requiring the encoding of the kinematics of the right hand to produce the appropriate predictive force on the left hand. While one group was provided with training movements in which this association was evident, the other group was trained on conditions in which this association was ambiguous. After adaptation, we tested the encoding of the learned motor memory by measuring the generalization to new movement combinations. While both groups adapted to the novel dynamics, the evident group showed a weighted encoding of the learned motor memory based on movements of the other (right) hand, whereas the ambiguous group exhibited mainly same (left) hand encoding in bimanual trials. Despite these differences, both groups demonstrated partial generalization to unimanual movements of the left hand. Our results show that motor memories can be encoded depending on the motion of other limbs, but that the training conditions strongly shape the encoding of the motor memory formation and determine the generalization to novel contexts.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Using cutlery, buttoning up a shirt, or cooking a meal requires precise coordination between two hands.

Whether it is coordinating a throw in judo or simply eating with a knife and fork, humans are able to coordinate and adapt to the complex dynamics across two limbs. Despite continually changing environmental constraints, sensorimotor transformations, and dynamics, humans perform skillful actions which require a high level of control. Many studies have shown that the sensorimotor control system adapts to novel dynamics by forming a predictive motor memory (or internal model) of the task [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Moreover, we form independent motor memories specific for the coordination of the two limbs [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] that depend on whether we move unimanually or bimanually [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Further studies on neural activation patterns confirm this distinction in internal model formation [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, measures of transfer from bimanual to unimanual contexts, and vice versa, revealed a partial compensation [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] indicating an overlapping component between internal models for these two contexts. Evidence from unimanual studies underlines the idea of a task-specific, local internal model formation. Adaptation to novel dynamics forms state-dependent representations: states experienced during learning are used to update the internal model and allow for adaptation to the novel environment [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This has been powerfully underlined by the study of Gonzales-Castro, Monsen and Smith [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], who showed that the sensorimotor control system relies on motion-referenced learning. That is, internal model updates between trials were most efficient for trials where the plan for the current trial matched the trajectory from the previous trial. However, learning does not only occur for the trained movement [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], but also generalizes to movements across similar states [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], where the amount of generalization decreases as the states diverge further from the trained conditions [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These generalization results have suggested that learning occurs through the tuning of Gaussian-like units or neural basis functions [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], which can be combined to allow for flexible actions in new environments.</p><p>The number of possible factors and states influencing the encoding and adaptation of motor memories multiplies in bimanual tasks. Bays and Wolpert [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] showed that the feedforward force generation of a stationary arm adapting to a force perturbation could be tailored to the movement direction of the opposite arm. Using a similar bimanual paradigm, Jackson and Miall [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] investigated the adaptation to a force perturbation, which was proportional to the movement speed of the contralateral arm performing a reaching movement. Their participants reduced the final end-point error quickly and showed an appropriate scaling of the predictive force to changes in movement velocity. They demonstrated that predictive forces by one arm could be generated based on the state-dependent encoding of the speed of the movement of the other arm. However, Jackson and Miall [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] did not assess how the contralateral predictive response would be shaped if both arms would do a reaching movement, where the states experienced by both arms could influence the formation of the motor memory. Yokoi et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] demonstrated that directional changes in movements of both arms led to gaussian-like decay in predictive force, supporting the hypothesis of overlapping neural control processes [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and the flexible encoding of kinematics of both arms to perform bimanual actions. Taken together, the sensorimotor control system is able to produce highly flexible motor commands simultaneously for our arms, based on the encoding of either one or both arms. However, it remains unclear how the sensorimotor control system associates the learned memory with the experienced states in bimanual movements. More specifically, how and to what extent does the sensorimotor control system combine the states of the left and right arms in the encoding of bimanual motor memory?</p><p>Here, we tested the motor memory formation with a novel paradigm which required the encoding of the kinematics in velocity space of the opposite, right hand to produce an adequate, predictive force on the left hand. While one group (the <italic toggle="yes">ambiguous</italic> group) was trained on matching movements with similar speeds and lengths for both arms, the other group (the <italic toggle="yes">evident</italic> group) had non-matching movements with different speeds and lengths for the left and right arms. Hence, the latter (evident) group faced different states between arms within each trial which allowed them to experience the evident relationship between the right-hand kinematics and the force field on the left hand. In contrast, the matching movement speeds of the ambiguous group provided little information about the appropriate encoding as the states of both arms were similar. Differences between arms could only be sensed through variability in the speeds of the two hands, hence the sensory information provided was ambiguous. To assess the underlying representation, specifically the amount of right-hand and left-hand encoding, we tested how participants generalized to novel combinations of the trained conditions (speeds). Furthermore, we removed the state information of the right hand in some trials to observe how the formed motor memory would cope with the lack of information and transfer to unimanual trials. Overall, we were able to assess how the sensorimotor system combines the experienced states from both arms to produce an appropriate motor command and discovered that this bimanual encoding is formed during exposure to a specific environment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><p>The aim of the current study was to understand how the sensorimotor control system associates the learned motor memory with the experienced states in bimanual movements. We trained two groups in different conditions, in both of which they had to adapt their movements to a velocity-dependent force field imposed on their left hand, where the forces experienced depended on the movement of their right hand (<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). The evident group trained on conditions in which the participants would clearly experience the left-hand forces depending on the right-hand velocity (conditions: <italic toggle="yes">b</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">fs</italic></sub>, <italic toggle="yes">b</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">mm</italic></sub> and <italic toggle="yes">b</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">sf</italic></sub>).

After adaptation to the force fields in these conditions, we tested the representation of the motor memory by measuring the participants&#x02019; predictive forces in novel conditions not experienced during the exposure phase (<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). We hypothesized that the evident group would extract the relationship between the left-hand forces and right-hand kinematics, and therefore should generalize the motor memory to the novel conditions (development of predictive force based on right-hand kinematics). In contrast, we hypothesized that the ambiguous group will be unable to extract this relationship, and therefore express a generalization pattern relying on the kinematics of the left hand or a combination of both and hence produce an inappropriate motor output.</p><fig position="float" id="pcbi.1011189.g001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011189.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Experimental set-up for both groups.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The experiment was divided into three phases: Baseline, Exposure and Generalization.

Previous research has shown partial transfer from bimanual to unimanual conditions when the force field magnitudes depend on the velocity of the same hand experiencing the forces. However, in our task, the forces depend on the movement of the other hand (right hand). Therefore, if participants were able to learn that the force fields depended entirely on the right-hand movement velocity (right-hand encoding), then they should produce no force on the unimanual movements. Inversely, a left-hand encoding should produce forces matching the forces from bimanual trials (See red and orange lines, respectively, in <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B</xref>). However, the participants of both groups produced peak forces in the unimanual conditions which were lower than during bimanual trials (Compare forces to <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>), and higher than a right encoding would predict. While for the ambiguous group both the average and the weighted encoding match well (<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.g009" ref-type="fig">Fig 9H to 9J</xref>), only average encoding is close to the generated forces in the evident group. The similarity in the fit between average and weighted encoding for the ambiguous group is explained by the mean encoding weights in the weighted condition (see <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>). While a fixed weight of 0.5 represents the average encoding, the weights were not fixed in the weighted encoding. Here, we fitted the weights across all trained conditions after adaptation (see <xref rid="sec008" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.e030" ref-type="disp-formula">Eq 6</xref>). The ambiguous group showed a mean weight of 0.374 &#x000b1; 0.045, which was significantly different from the evident group with 0.935 &#x000b1; 0.021 (independent t-test, <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>(14) = &#x02212;11.420, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, Cohen&#x02019;s <italic toggle="yes">d</italic> = &#x02212;4.410). Hence, the ambiguous group relied more on the kinematic encoding of both arms with a slight tendency towards the left to predict the next trial, while the evident group relied strongly on the right arm with only a small contribution of the left arm in bimanual trials. Confronted with the loss of information from the right arm in unimanual trials, the evident group seems to employ the average encoding. When the average encoding depicts the standard, naive state in bimanual actions, we should also detect a gradual shift during exposure toward the respective weighted encoding. This is exactly what we see when analyzing the development of the weights over time in <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B</xref>: the ambiguous group had a tendency towards the average encoding throughout the experiment, while the evident group shifted towards the right-hand encoding in the exposure phase and remained there during generalization.</p><fig position="float" id="pcbi.1011189.g008"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011189.g008</object-id><label>Fig 8</label><caption><title>Differences in encoding weights between the ambiguous and evident groups.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mean encoding weights in generalization phase.

Our study focused on the formation of bimanual motor memories and how the experienced states during training affected the encoding of the motor memory and influenced the subsequent motor output. We showed that the human sensorimotor control system is able to flexibly control bimanual actions and form motor memories based on the kinematics of both arms. Two groups of participants adapted to novel dynamics within a bimanual movement task. The evident group trained in conditions in which there was information available that the forces experienced on the left hand depended on the right-hand velocity. The ambiguous group only trained with conditions where this relation was not explicitly presented as both hands made the same movements. The encoding of the motor memory was examined by testing generalization to novel combinations of right and left-hand movement speeds (untrained conditions). Both groups adapted to the novel dynamics during exposure, showing clear adaptation to the trained conditions, but with slightly different patterns of generalization to the untrained conditions. The evident group was able to retrieve the relationship between the right-hand velocity and the force field strength acting on the left hand, as was shown by the shift in encoding weight towards the right hand during exposure, the generalization to novel combinations of the trained conditions (speeds) and the best performance of the weighted encoding model. On the other hand, the ambiguous group mainly learned the force field as a function of both hands with a slight shift towards the left hand (<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>), as evidenced by the primarily left-hand encoding on the untrained conditions during generalization, indicated by the left hand and weighted encoding model (<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>). Moreover, the BIC model comparison for all bimanual conditions underlines the selection of the weighted encoding model in the ambiguous group as well (<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). Finally, we tested the transfer of the learned bimanual motor memory to unimanual reaching movements, showing a clear decrease in force for both groups. That is, the transfer to unimanual movements was similar regardless of the shift to either right- or left-hand encoding.</p><p>Although the sensorimotor control system performs similar movements over and over again in daily life, none of the movements will be performed identically to the previous movements. Hence, the sensorimotor control system creates a motor memory, adapted to the environmental dynamics, which is able to generalize across similar states. That is, generalization of an existing motor memory helps the sensorimotor control system perform successful actions outside of the specific learned context. The amount and pattern of generalization to a novel context (or different states) differ between dimensions, e.g. between different movement speeds or different movement lengths [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. As the peak velocity of a movement increases or decreases away from the trained movement, we scale our endpoint force appropriately [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. There is a strong generalization to shorter movements, but generalization to longer movements is limited unless the occasional interspersed trial at this longer distance is experienced [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In our study, we directly trained participants with force fields associated with three movements of different lengths and velocities. Both groups of participants were able to learn to produce the appropriate force compensation for the dynamics with the left hand, scaling to the different movement velocities of the training conditions. While the ambiguous group primarily scaled the forces produced by the left hand according to the left-hand velocity (weighted towards left-hand encoding), the evident group extracted sufficient information to scale (at least partially) the forces in the left hand with the right-hand movement velocities (weighted towards right-hand encoding). Here we have extended previous work [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] by showing that this velocity-dependent scaling of generalization can occur across the two limbs. Importantly, one key aspect of our study is that movement of the non-adapting limb is not only acting as a contextual cue. While associative learning can play a crucial role in motor adaptation [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], the motor memory in the current study is encoded based on the actual kinematics of the movement. This means that participants learned to map the weighted, continuous velocities of the arms to a given force instead of discrete, contextual cues to a perturbation [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>Generalization also occurs across different movement locations and different movement directions. If the spatial allocation (location) of the movement changes, the amount of generalization found depends on the motor memory representation and the distance away from the trained movement [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Similarly, as the angle of the movement changes further away from the trained movement direction we find a decrease in predictive motor output [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. This decrease in the generalization with angular deviation is consistent with the use of local neural basis functions with Gaussian-like tuning as the building blocks of the motor memories [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The idea is that forming motor memories via these local neural basis functions can provide the flexibility in the tuning of these motor memories to a variety of different states and conditions. Classical, unimanual force field paradigms [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] as well as bimanual force field studies [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] showed that humans are able to directly learn a mapping between the forces perturbing the arm and the velocity of that arm. However, we were able to show that this mapping is dependent on the experienced states during exposure to the force field and that this encoding is flexible enough to be influenced by the training paradigm. The ambiguous group showed a shift towards left-hand encoding which is in line with these classical studies. On the other hand, the evident group used a strong shift to right-hand encoding pattern to generalize to novel combinations of movement speeds of the two hands. This shows that the sensorimotor control system has sufficient flexibility in its encoding to combine the states of both the right and left arm to encode a new bimanual motor memory. Instead of a rigid distribution between left and right, it employs a highly flexible encoding which reacts rapidly to changing environments. This finding extends previous results of bimanual experiments, which assumed full right-hand encoding [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This is also evident in our last step: we removed the kinematic information of the right hand in unimanual trials (where the right hand remains stationary) to see whether any forces were still produced by the left arm. As the evident group was mostly encoding right-hand kinematics in bimanual trials, we expected them to show little transfer. In contrast, we might expect stronger transfer for the ambiguous group as they exhibited a shift towards left-hand encoding. However, transfer from bimanual to unimanual conditions was substantial and similar in both groups. These results underlined previous findings which showed partial transfer when switching from bimanual to unimanual actions and vice versa [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Again, this highlighted the flexibility of the human sensorimotor control system while encountering new environments and situations. Interestingly, the partial transfer from bimanual to unimanual control of approximately 50% of the learned peak forces compares well to the reported transfer of 58% by Nozaki et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and slightly less than the 65% found by Yokoi et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Despite the very different training conditions of the two groups in our experiment, which produced a shift towards right-hand encoding for the evident group and left-hand encoding for the ambiguous group, the peak forces were similar for both groups. If this transfer to the unimanual conditions occurs as a byproduct of the final encoding of the learned motor memory, then we would predict two very different levels of transfer in these two conditions, with much higher transfer for the ambiguous group. In addition, we would predict a scaling between unimanual conditions based on the learned scaling from the exposure for the ambiguous group as well. While the latter existed indeed (see Figs <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.g006" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.g009" ref-type="fig">9</xref>) for the ambiguous group and was absent in the evident group, we did not measure a difference between experiments in the total amount of transfer. One possible explanation is that this transfer, or more specifically this tuning of the neural basis functions related to the unimanual motor memory might occur early during the exposure phase when little information about the perturbation is available [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This rapid, initial adaptation is then simply maintained in memory throughout the rest of the experiment until probed at the end, and could explain the similarity between both groups. This idea is further underlined by the development of the encoding weights during the experiment (<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B</xref>). Initially, the state information for creating the prediction is not evident. During the exposure, participants learned to combine the kinematic inputs from both arms to predict the motor output. Being confronted with a new (unimanual) environment, they might base their predictions on these early states. Despite the overall similar levels of transfer to the unimanual condition, the extensive exposure to the different training conditions produced small but clear differences on the force production in the unimanual trials. Specifically, the ambiguous group, which demonstrated a shift to left-hand encoding for the bimanual trials, showed a small, significant scaling of the lateral forces with the speed of the left hand, matching the scaling during the trained, bimanual conditions. That is, the participants learned that forces were affected by the velocity of the movement, and associated these forces with changes in the velocity of the left hand, as predicted by their shift to left-hand bimanual encoding. In contrast, this scaling was absent for the evident group, where they showed almost identical force profiles for the three different unimanual trials. We propose that this may be due to the stronger reliance on right-hand encoding of the motor memory, and the absence of this additional input that should drive this scaling&#x02014;the speed or kinematics of the right hand. These differences in the two groups might again reflect our hypothesis that most of the adaptation shown in unimanual trials occurred primarily during early exposure. In addition, force profiles in early exposure show a similar scaling in forces between conditions for the ambiguous group and no scaling for the evident group (<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B and 4G</xref>). We suggest that both groups experienced an initial generic tuning of the unimanual adaptation early in learning, that would not be tuned to the different velocity conditions. Continued exposure to the training conditions would train the right hand encoding in the evident group leaving this generic response intact through the training. In contrast, such exposure in the ambiguous group would train the left-hand encoding in which the force scaled with left-hand velocity, and therefore gradually fine-tune these unimanual responses. Further research measuring unimanual transfer early in exposure is needed to test this hypothesis and understand the processes governing the motor memory formation and the subsequent transfer to unimanual conditions. While the evident group experienced clear differences in the velocities of the hands, allowing them to learn the mapping between right-hand velocity and the resulting forces on the left hand, the ambiguous group was not provided with clear information regarding the force implementation. However, due to noise and variations within the sensorimotor system, there were small differences in velocities between the hands resulting in slightly unmatched movements. This might have allowed them to experience the relationship between right-hand velocity and left-hand forces. These small effects might underlie the small weight of right-hand encoding that was found for the ambiguous group. As this was around 40% across the participants, it is clear that the small trial-by-trial variability in movement velocities was by itself not sufficient for the participants to extract the full force field representation. However, the partial weighting of right-hand encoding even within the ambiguous group supports the findings that higher motor variability and motor noise can be beneficial to adapt to novel environments [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies have proposed compound conditioning paradigms from associative learning theory to explain motor adaptation cued by arbitrary stimuli [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These studies typically employ a contextual cue that precedes the actual movement [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. While this is a possible explanation of our findings, we argue that in the current study, the sensorimotor system encoded the weighted velocity of both arms to predict the force instead of explicit cues from the environment. Importantly, one key aspect of the compound paradigm, the additivity principle, states that the combined strength of associated cues is bounded [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This predicts a negative correlation between associated cues [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, this is not consistent with the current experimental results, specifically the transfer to the unimanual conditions. Given a negative correlation, we would expect higher forces in the ambiguous group, as they would rely more on the left arm movement as a cue, while for the evident group, we would expect lower forces. However, the force levels are similar between groups, rejecting the hypothesis of a bounded associative strength of the contextual cues.</p><p>In addition, while we tested generalization on novel combinations of movement speeds, each hand was only tested on conditions in which the training was performed. That is, each hand had previously experienced forces on the fast, medium, and slow movements. Testing generalization of the learned motor memory outside of the trained conditions of both hands (to much faster or much slower movements) would allow us to measure the underlying processes better. This would allow us to determine to what degree the learned motor memory is locally learned compared to full predictive models of the adaptation.</p><p>Our findings on the partial transfer of learning between unimanual and bimanual actions, and the difference in motor output between unimanual and bimanual movements, confirming previous results [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], are further underlined by studies reporting altered neural activation patterns in the primary motor cortex between these two actions [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Recent evidence from a load perturbation study suggested that the activity of neurons in M1 can indeed express two independent representations for unimanual and bimanual movements simultaneously [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Further, it has been hypothesized that the cerebellum plays a major role in motor memory formation [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The authors state that the cerebellum might host a multitude of different internal models, which could reflect distinct internal models for bimanual and unimanual movements in our experiments. Depending on the context, different models would be retrieved and might control and adjust the subsequent motor output. Apart from the crucial role of M1 and the cerebellum, other areas such as parietal and frontal regions and the spinal cord have been considered to contribute to the sensorimotor integration underlying motor memory formation [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. This neuro-physiological evidence in combination with the findings from our study underline the need for experiments investigating the interplay between unimanual and bimanual motor memories and their expression on a neuronal level.</p><p>To conclude, we were able to show that the human sensorimotor control system is able to encode the sensory information of both hands and flexibly combine the information to control the movement of the other hand. More specifically, the right-hand velocity was used to predict the motor output on the left arm. This highlights that motor memory formation is a highly flexible process, which might occur through the tuning of neural basis functions. The tuning of these basis functions has to take many variables into account, e.g. the kinematics of both arms [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This is also underlined by the switch to the unimanual conditions: although the evident group relied mostly on right-hand encoding, they showed substantial transfer&#x02014;possibly enabled by neural basis functions which have been activated previously during similar states in bimanual movements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Participants</title><p>Sixteen individuals (mean age 25.9 &#x000b1; 3.0 years, 7 females) participated in this study and were randomly assigned to the evident group (N = 8) or ambiguous group (N = 8).

We instructed participants to make straight, natural reaching movements to the targets (or target) while keeping their eye gaze at the fixation cross.

Participants were asked to make simultaneous movements of both hands to the two targets. Trials ended when both cursors rested in the target position for 600 ms. After each movement feedback was provided about the speed of each hand separately. If participants obtained peak speed within the desired ranges, they were provided with &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;great&#x0201d; feedback (&#x0201c;great&#x0201d; occurred when participants&#x02019; speed was within the middle 50% of the desired range).

Each condition is named according to the left and right speed requirements, such that a slow movement on the left hand and a fast movement on the right hand would be indicated as <italic toggle="yes">b</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">sf</italic></sub>, whereas a fast movement on the left hand and slow movement on the right hand is indicated as <italic toggle="yes">b</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">fs</italic></sub>.</p><p>In the unimanual (u) conditions, the left-hand movement distance was one of 15, 20 or 25 cm, while the right hand remained stationary. Again the desired movement time was fixed to 700 ms for all distances, resulting in a slow (s), medium (m) or fast (f) movement of the left hand. These three conditions were therefore indicated as <italic toggle="yes">u</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">s</italic></sub>, <italic toggle="yes">u</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">m</italic></sub>, and <italic toggle="yes">u</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">f</italic></sub>.</p><p>Two groups of participants (evident and ambiguous) performed the experiments and experienced force fields on three of the bimanual conditions. The evident group trained on conditions in which the participants would clearly experience the left-hand forces depending on the right-hand velocity. That is, the evident group, was trained on two conditions in which the left and right hands moved at different speeds (<italic toggle="yes">b</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">sf</italic></sub>, <italic toggle="yes">b</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">fs</italic></sub>) as well as the middle condition (<italic toggle="yes">b</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">mm</italic></sub>). In contrast, the ambiguous group trained on conditions in which this relationship between left-hand forces and right-hand velocity was not clearly apparent. Specifically, the ambiguous group was trained on conditions in which the left and right hands moved at the same speeds (<italic toggle="yes">b</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">ss</italic></sub>, <italic toggle="yes">b</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">mm</italic></sub>, <italic toggle="yes">b</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">ff</italic></sub>). Although in both groups the forces experienced in the left hand depend on the right-hand velocities, the evident group was presented with conditions where the left- and right-hand velocities were clearly different, whereas the ambiguous group would only experience this if the left and right-hand velocities were different according to motor variability.</p><p>The experiment itself was divided into three phases (<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>): baseline, exposure and generalization. The baseline phase consisted of six blocks of 48 trials (288 trials total) in the null field. Within the first five baseline blocks, each condition (unimanual and bimanual) was presented three times in the null field (36 null field trials) and once in an error clamp trial (12 error clamp trials). All conditions were randomized across each block. In the last baseline block, participants were only presented with the three training conditions (evident group: <italic toggle="yes">b</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">sf</italic></sub>, <italic toggle="yes">b</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">mm</italic></sub> and <italic toggle="yes">b</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">fs</italic></sub>; ambiguous group: <italic toggle="yes">b</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">ff</italic></sub>, <italic toggle="yes">b</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">mm</italic></sub> and <italic toggle="yes">b</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">ss</italic></sub>), with two error clamp trials and 14 null field trials for each of the three conditions (6 error-clamp and 42 null field trials). The exposure phase consisted of 20 blocks of 48 trials (960 trials total) in the force field. These blocks contained the same structure as the final baseline block, with two error clamp trials and fourteen force field trials for each training condition. The final generalization phase consisted of 20 blocks of 48 trials (960 trials total). In the generalization phase, each block consisted of twelve force field trials for each of the three training conditions (36 force field trials) and one error clamp trial for all bimanual and unimanual conditions (12 error clamp trials).</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The data was analyzed with Python 3.8.12, the Sypder IDE (Spyder 5.1.5, The Scientific Python Development Environment) and Jupyter Notebook 6.4.6. Position and force data was filtered with a 5th order, zero lag Butterworth low pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 40 Hz, using SciPy&#x02019;s filtfilt function [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. To remove any drift of the measured handle forces due to an inconsistent position on the air sled during error clamp trials [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], we subtracted the mean lateral force applied 200 ms to 150 ms before movement onset from the subsequent force vector.</p><sec id="sec016"><title>Kinematic error</title><p>During null field and force field trials, we used the maximum perpendicular error (MPE) as a measure of adaptation to the force field.

For plotting purposes, we averaged the maximum perpendicular error over a bin of 12 trials.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Force compensation</title><p>The force compensation (FC) is a scalar which depicts the amount of adaptation to the force field, by measuring the imposed forces acting laterally on the handle on the clamp trials [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The force compensation value is calculated as the regression coefficient of a linear regression between the actual force output and the predicted force profile required to perfectly compensate the perturbation [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In our study, the force field applied to the left hand depended on the velocity of the right handle. Therefore, the predicted force profile for bimanual conditions is calculated as the product of the right-hand velocity and the force field strength (13 Ns/m). Importantly, a force field was never applied during any unimanual conditions.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Force profiles and peak forces</title><p>In order to evaluate the shape and timing of feedforward, predictive forces during channel trials, we aligned the force profile of the left hand to the peak velocity of the right hand and clipped the time window to 400 ms before and after peak velocity [<xref rid="pcbi.1011189.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Peak forces were assessed by calculating the average of the left force profile in a window of 20ms around peak velocity of the right arm in bimanual trials and around peak velocity of the left arm in unimanual trials.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Predicted outcomes and encoding weights</title><p>In our experiment, the force field was applied to the left hand according to the velocity of the right hand. Here we examined whether adaptation resulted from learning this relationship (dependence on the velocity of the right hand), simply independent learning of the force field within a single limb (ignoring the relationship with the right-hand velocity) or different combinations of both arms. These combinations could entail average encoding by weighting each input equally or a weighted encoding by a variable weight between arms. First, we fitted the different predictions to the generated force profiles during generalization in the trained conditions. We fitted the right, left, average, and weighted encoding models to the force profiles by applying a nonlinear regression model (minimize from SciPy) to our force and velocity data defined by:

<named-content content-type="letter-date">12 Jul 2023</named-content>
</p><p>Dear Prof. Franklin,</p><p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "Learning context shapes bimanual control strategy and generalization of novel dynamics" for consideration at PLOS Computational Biology.</p><p>As with all papers reviewed by the journal, your manuscript was reviewed by members of the editorial board and by several independent reviewers. The reviewers found that the study was well designed and well conducted, with mostly clear results and conclusions, but did raise&#x000a0;some substantial concerns. In particular, the application&#x000a0;of computational models is not as thorough as would normally be expected for papers published in&#x000a0;PLOS Computational Biology.&#x000a0;Given that the application of computational models is central to this journal we have to regard this as a significant weakness of the paper. We would, however, be willing to consider a revised version of the paper if you can address this, along with other weaknesses highlighted by the reviewers.</p><p>One suggestion&#x000a0;for&#x000a0;streamlining the computational part of the paper&#x000a0;is that presenting and fitting a multitude of closely related&#x000a0;models (Equations 3-7) is overly complicated when in fact all the models&#x000a0;considered&#x000a0;are special cases of a general model in which the predicted force is a linear combination of left and right hand velocities. It may be more straightforward to fit this two-parameter model (which is basically equivalent to the weight model)&#x000a0;and interpret the estimated parameters, rather than comparing 5 distinct models, some of which are quite arbitrarily chosen (e.g. the average and subtract models). A clearer evaluation and presentation of how well this model accounts for behavior&#x000a0;across the&#x000a0;different generalization conditions (ideally on conditions outside those used to fit the model)&#x000a0;would also help&#x000a0;improve the modeling results.</p><p>I wanted to add a few&#x000a0;other comments on top of those of the reviewers. First, before Jackson and Miall, there was also a paper from Bays and Wolpert (J Neurosci, 2006) which considered a similar paradigm and ought to be cited. You might also look at&#x000a0;Krakauer et al., PLOS Biology, which examined generalization of&#x000a0;shoulder/wrist movements, rather than left hand/ right hand, but contains a similar idea. Third, the&#x000a0;attribution of the force to either the left or right hand is very reminiscent of compound conditioning paradigms in which e.g. a light and a tone are presented together, then one is subsequently removed. See e.g. Gershman 2015, PLOS Computational Biology for a review of models of this type of task, which might be pertinent. A model&#x000a0;along these lines was also included in Krakauer et al., 2006, and somewhat related&#x000a0;ideas are discussed in&#x000a0;Avraham eLife, 2022. You may find that&#x000a0;these are&#x000a0;interesting parallels to at least discuss.</p><p>In light of the reviews (below this email), we would like to invite the resubmission of a significantly-revised version that takes into account the reviewers' comments. In particular, in&#x000a0;this revision, we would expect the computational parts of the paper to be substantially improved, although all other reviewer concerns should also be addressed.&#x000a0;We cannot make any decision about publication until we have seen the revised manuscript and your response to the reviewers' comments. Your revised manuscript is also likely to be sent to reviewers for further evaluation.</p><p>Also note that, alternatively, if you feel that your results can stand alone without relying strongly on computational modeling approaches (which may well be the case), then you might prefer to submit your work to a different journal that places less emphasis on using computational methods.</p><p>When you resubmit, please upload the following:</p><p>[1] A letter containing a detailed list of your responses to the review comments and a description of the changes you have made in the manuscript.&#x000a0;Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.</p><p>[2] Two versions of the revised manuscript: one with either highlights or tracked changes denoting where the text has been changed; the other a clean version (uploaded as the manuscript file).</p><p>Important additional instructions are given below your reviewer comments.</p><p>Please prepare and submit your revised manuscript within 60 days. If you anticipate any delay, please let us know the expected resubmission date by replying to this email. Please note that revised manuscripts received after the 60-day due date may require evaluation and peer review similar to newly submitted manuscripts.</p><p>Thank you again for your submission.

</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#x000a0;Summary:</p><p>The authors presented clear evidence that during bimanual movement, one arm can refer to</p><p>the other arm's motion state when learning to resist the mechanical load induced by the</p><p>other arm. The authors also showed that this attribution to the arms&#x02019; motion states is</p><p>dependent on the degree how the motion states of two arms are correlated; If the motion</p><p>states of the arms are de-correlated, one can learn the correct association between the load</p><p>to the left arm and motion of the right arm. On the other hand, when the states are perfectly</p><p>correlated (i.e., both arms were moving in the same way), the load induced by the right arm</p><p>motion was partially attributed to the motion of the left arm. Although this finding is</p><p>somewhat expected, a more interesting finding is that despite such a difference in attribution,</p><p>the overall transfer of bimanual learning to the unimanual movement was less affected by</p><p>the training context. The results presented are informative for the motor learning community.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is well-written, and the results are clear. The authors did a</p><p>good job addressing the concerns raised in the previous round. I only have several minor</p><p>points that can be easily addressed.</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>Line#157-158 and line# 266-267: Given the results of unimanual conditions (Fig. 7E), it looks</p><p>ambiguous group shows modulation by the speed in the early exposure phase (Fig. 4G).</p><p>Though this may be simply due to the use of different ANOVA, a brief mention of this could</p><p>be helpful.</p><p>Line# 176-260: ANOVA results are missing. Referring to appropriate figure panels (e.g., Fig.</p><p>5A, B) would largely help readers to understand the results of bimanual conditions.</p><p>Especially, Figures 5B and 5D seem not referred to in the Results section.</p><p>Line#192-193: B is omitted here.</p><p>Figure 5C and D: If I correctly understood, the models were fitted to training condition data</p><p>and then tested on the data for generalization conditions. It is unclear whether the MSEs</p><p>presented here include that for the training data. In the context of cross-validation, the MSEs</p><p>for the fitting (i.e., MSEs for training condition data) should be excluded from the evaluation.</p><p>Figure 5D: Missing x-labels</p><p>The presentation of Figure 5 could be improved. For instance, the data for bimanual and</p><p>unimanual conditions could go into separate figures, as the current version is too visually</p><p>crowded. Also, using lines in Fig. 5C and D is not very informative. Simply using dots</p><p>arranged horizontally can improve visibility in the same space.</p><p>Panel D can be only for unimanual conditions and probably go to separate figures with</p><p>unimanual peak force data (from panels A and B).</p><p>As there are separated panels for the two groups, actual force values do not need different</p><p>colors. Currently, it is visually hard to detect lines in similar colors (e.g., red/orange lines over</p><p>brown shade). Gray shade could be nice for getting good contrast with all the colors used.</p><p>Line#609: Referring to wrong Eq. # (should be seven instead of 5).</p><p>Line#594-619 (regression analysis): Were the alpha values also constrained to [0,1]? If so, it</p><p>might be unfair to the subtraction coding model (perhaps the presence of B requires the</p><p>constraint on alpha, but the B in the models looks redundant). Please clarify.</p><p>Please also specify how unimanual conditions were simulated (by simply setting x_dot_right</p><p>to 0?).</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;In this work, the authors probe the influence of speed or movement length as a factor in adopting a bimanual control strategy. They perform an experiment wherein the speed of right hand movement determined the lateral force applied to the left hand. Two experimental groups were employed, both utilizing the velocity of right hand movement to determine the left-hand forces while the right hand always moved in a null field. In the &#x0201c;ambiguous&#x0201d; group, both hands moved at identical speeds and distances, creating ambiguity for the sensorimotor system in utilizing the sensory state of either hand to plan subsequent movements. In contrast, for the &#x0201c;evident&#x0201d; group, there was a distinction in speed between the hands, making it evident to the sensorimotor system that right hand speed was more relevant for predicting the force-field applied to the left hand. Generalization trials, incorporating interspersed error clamp catch trials, were used to assess the encoding scheme utilized in forming the bimanual memory. The authors report that the evident group employed a right hand encoding scheme, whereas the ambiguous group adopted an average or weighted average encoding scheme for bimanual memory formation.</p><p>1. How the motor system adapts to perturbations applied during bimanual movements is not well understood, and the literature on this topic is also limited. The study therefore addresses an important issue, but the findings are hardly profound or ground-breaking. The larger conclusion that training conditions strongly influence the encoding of a motor memory, and hence also shape subsequent generalization, is well-known from work in unimanual movements. The current study extends this to bimanual action conditions, but does not break new ground in terms of deepening our understanding about the influence of training conditions.</p><p>2. I also think that the authors have over-interpreted their results in favour of what has been ultimately reported. Specifically, it is not at all clear to me why the average encoding isn&#x02019;t the best predictor of how people adapt left arm dynamics in either group. The authors do consider this possibility for the ambiguous group (and this makes sense), but I am not convinced that the right hand encoding does better than the average encoding for the evident group. All the plots of figure 5 and the statistics also point to average encoding doing better even for the evident group. The authors are requested to present key metrics that will convince a reader that</p><p>3. Control groups with force fields applied to the left arm under unimanual conditions are sorely missing from the study. While it may be obvious that predictive force development will be associated only with left arm kinematics in this case, it is important to know how the left arm contribution during bimanual actions, particularly in the ambiguous case, emerges/changes relative to the unimanual condition.</p><p>4. The modelling Results are very under-reported. The authors have made somewhat sweeping statements about one encoding model being better or worse than another. However, no statistical comparison across different models is available. The authors must provide a solid comparison across models (using AIC, etc.) so that one can make more informed and reliable conclusions about which encoding method works best in the two cases.</p><p>5. This study has a very limited sample size &#x02013; only 8 subjects per group. Our field of work has gained some disrepute due to small sample sizes and most labs are striving to do better. The authors are therefore requested to provide a justification for why such a small sample size is good enough for making sound conclusions.</p><p>Minor:</p><p>1. Is the right arm encoding line missing from the bff condition in Figure 5B? I cant seem to find the red line.</p><p>2. line 609: "Initial &#x003c9; in (5) was set to 0.5". There is no &#x003c9; in eq. 5.</p><p>**********</p><p>
