Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) markedly reduces the iNANC relaxation of both guinea pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and human airways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], indicating that nitric oxide (NO) is a major neurotransmitter of the iNANC system. In addition, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) has been implicated in iNANC relaxation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and colocalization of NOS and VIP has been demonstrated both in guinea pig [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and in human airway nerves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>NO is generated by a family of NOS isoforms that utilize the semi-essential amino acid L-arginine, oxygen and NADPH as substrates to produce NO and L-citrulline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Three isoforms of NOS have been identified: neuronal NOS (nNOS), endothelial NOS (eNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS). In the airways, the constitutive NOS (cNOS) isoforms are mainly expressed in the iNANC neurons (nNOS), the endothelium (eNOS) and the epithelium (nNOS and eNOS), whereas iNOS, which is induced by proinflammatory cytokines during airway inflammation, is mainly expressed in macrophages and epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Another L-arginine metabolizing enzyme is arginase, which hydrolyzes L-arginine to L-ornithine and urea. Arginase is classically considered to be an enzyme of the urea cycle in the liver, but also occurs in extrahepatic tissues, including the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Two distinct isoforms of arginase have been identified in mammals: arginase I, a cytosolic enzyme, mainly expressed in the liver, and arginase II, a mitochondrial enzyme, which is mainly expressed in extrahepatic tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Extrahepatic arginase has been implicated in the regulation of NO synthesis by limiting the availability of intracellular L-arginine for NOS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In addition, arginase might be involved in cell growth and tissue repair via the production of L-ornithine, a precursor of polyamines and proline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Both arginase isoforms are constitutively expressed in the airways, particularly in the bronchial epithelium and in fibroblasts from peribronchial connective tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Using a perfused guinea pig tracheal tube preparation, we have previously demonstrated that endogenous arginase activity is functionally involved in the regulation of airway smooth muscle tone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Endogenous arginase potentiates methacholine-induced airway constriction by diminishing agonist-induced NO production, by competition with epithelial cNOS for the common substrate, L-arginine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Previous studies had demonstrated that L-arginine availability is indeed a limiting factor for agonist-induced NO-production and airway relaxation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>A role for arginase in the iNANC system has been found in internal anal sphincter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and penile corpus cavernosum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Thus, arginase inhibition increased electrical field stimulation (EFS)-induced relaxation of these preparations, indicating that endogenous arginase activity attenuates nNOS-mediated NANC relaxation.</p><p>The role of endogenous arginase in the regulation of iNANC-derived NO generation in the airways has not yet been investigated. In the present study, we demonstrated that endogenous arginase activity and L-arginine availability are importantly involved in the modulation of iNANC nerve-mediated NO-production and relaxation of guinea pig tracheal smooth muscle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Male specific pathogen free HsdPoc:Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs (Harlan Heathfield, UK), weighing 500 &#x02013; 800 g, were used in this study.

After exsanguination, the trachea was removed from the larynx to the bronchi and rapidly placed in a Krebs-Henseleit (KH) buffer solution of 37&#x000b0;C, gassed with 95% O<sub>2 </sub>and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The composition of the KH-solution in mM was: NaCl 117.50; KCl 5.60; MgSO<sub>4 </sub>1.18; CaCl<sub>2 </sub>2.50; NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>1.28; NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>25.0 and D-glucose 5.50; pH 7.4. The trachea was prepared free of serosal connective tissue. Twelve single proximal tracheal open-ring preparations were mounted for isotonic recording (0.3 g preload) between two parallel platinum point-electrodes in water-jacketed (37&#x000b0;C) organ baths containing 20.0 ml of gassed KH-solution and indomethacin (3 &#x003bc;M), which remained present during the whole experiment to eliminate any influence of prostanoids.</p></sec><sec><title>Electrical field stimulation-induced relaxation experiments</title><p>After a 30 min equilibration period, tracheal preparations were relaxed with isoprenaline (0.1 &#x003bc;M) to establish basal tone. After a washout period of 30 min with three washes with fresh KH solution, maximal contraction of the tracheal preparations to histamine was determined with cumulative additions of the agonist (0.1, 1, 10 and 100 &#x003bc;M). After washout (30 min), the tracheal preparations were precontracted with histamine to 30% of the maximal histamine-induced tone in the presence of atropine (1 &#x003bc;M) to prevent EFS-induced cholinergic airway contraction. On the plateau, biphasic EFS (150 mA, 4 ms, 4 s, 0.5 &#x02013; 16 Hz) was applied and frequency response curves (0.5 &#x02013; 16 Hz in doubling steps) were recorded. Per preparation, one frequency response curve was performed. When used, the nonselective NOS inhibitor N<sup>&#x003c9;</sup>-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA; 100 &#x003bc;M), the specific arginase inhibitor N<sup>&#x003c9;</sup>-hydroxy-nor-L-arginine (nor-NOHA; 10 &#x003bc;M), a combination of both inhibitors, or L-arginine (0.3, 1.0 or 5.0 mM) were applied 30 min prior to histamine-addition. In line with previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], neither the NOS inhibitor, nor the arginase inhibitor and L-arginine affected agonist-induced tone in the open-ring preparations. All measurements were performed in triplicate.

Similarly, the role of arginase activity in the modulation of EFS-induced airway relaxation was determined by the effect of the arginase inhibitor nor-NOHA.

In the present study, we demonstrated that endogenous arginase activity is also involved in the regulation of iNANC nerve-mediated airway smooth muscle relaxation.</p><p>In line with previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], it was demonstrated that the NOS inhibitor L-NNA inhibited EFS-induced iNANC relaxation of guinea pig tracheal preparations. This inhibition was most pronounced at the lower frequencies, indicating a prominent role of nNOS-derived NO at these frequencies. By contrast, inhibition of arginase activity by nor-NOHA caused a considerable (up to 3.3-fold) increase in EFS-induced relaxation at low frequencies, indicating that endogenous arginase activity restricts iNANC nerve-mediated airway smooth muscle relaxation. The increased relaxation after arginase inhibition was completely reverted by L-NNA, clearly indicating that arginase activity attenuates iNANC nerve-mediated airway smooth muscle relaxation by limiting NO production, presumably by competition with nNOS for their common substrate, L-arginine.</p><p>The observation that exogenous L-arginine significantly enhanced the EFS-induced airway smooth muscle relaxation confirms that L-arginine is indeed a limiting factor in EFS-induced, NO-mediated airway smooth muscle relaxation under basal conditions. Remarkably, the effect of nor-NOHA was similar to that observed in the presence of the maximally effective L-arginine concentration, indicating that endogenous arginase activity is a major factor in regulating the neural NO-mediated airway smooth muscle relaxation.</p><p>Recently, we discovered that increased arginase activity is importantly involved in the pathophysiology of asthma by contributing to the allergen-induced NO-deficiency and subsequent airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine after the early asthmatic reaction, by limiting the availability of L-arginine for cNOS to produce bronchodilating NO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Arginase activity as well as expression was also considerably increased in two mouse models of allergic asthma, irrespective whether the animals were challenged with ovalbumin or with <italic>Aspergillus fumigatus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Moreover, enhanced mRNA or protein expression of arginase I was observed in human asthmatic lung tissue, particularly in inflammatory cells and in the airway epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], while increased arginase activity was measured in asthmatic serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In guinea pig tracheal strips, it has previously been demonstrated that EFS-induced iNANC relaxation is reduced after ovalbumin-challenge, due to a deficiency of iNANC nerve-derived NO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that increased arginase activity could similarly be involved in allergen-induced reduced iNANC activity.</p><p>A role for arginase by restricting the L-arginine availability for nNOS in iNANC nerves has also been proposed in the pathophysiology of erectile dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In support, increased expression and activity of arginase II contributing to reduced NO production has been demonstrated in diabetic cavernosal tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Neuronal arginase may also be involved in gastrointestinal motility disorders, by reducing nNOS-mediated iNANC relaxation in the internal anal sphincter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first demonstration that endogenous arginase activity is functionally involved in iNANC nerve activity in the airways, by attenuating the generation of nNOS-derived NO.
