HCPs were uneasy about sharing U = U due to concerns about risk compensation and ART non-adherence and worried about enabling any ensuing HIV transmission. HCPs also need a simple, unambiguous, and consistent narrative for U = U, integrated with other HIV prevention messages.

Although South Africa moved to immediate ART for all persons diagnosed with HIV6, treatment uptake and viral load (VL) testing remain suboptimal [<xref rid="pone.0295920.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295920.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Challenges in ART adherence, retention, and HIV stigma contribute to the disconnect between individual-level efficacy and population-level effectiveness of &#x0201c;treatment-as-prevention&#x0201d; (TasP) [<xref rid="pone.0295920.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295920.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, the benefits of TasP are not systematically conveyed to patients as part of HIV counselling in South Africa, limiting the potential of this information to motivate treatment adherence, improve viral suppression, and reduce stigma [<xref rid="pone.0295920.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295920.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The poor impact of TasP on individual HIV treatment outcomes may be partially attributable to the low and indirect dissemination of the prevention benefits of ART [<xref rid="pone.0295920.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295920.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>In 2016, the Prevention Access Campaign launched the Undetectable = Untransmittable (U = U) campaign to promote the dissemination of TasP, focusing on the social, mental, and emotional benefits of eliminating HIV transmission fears by emphasising viral suppression. The direct communication of U = U has been shown to increase men&#x02019;s HIV testing uptake in South Africa [<xref rid="pone.0295920.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], improve persons living with HIV (PLHIV)&#x02019;s self-image, and reduced anticipated HIV social stigma related to dating and sex [<xref rid="pone.0295920.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295920.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, knowledge about the U = U campaign and the science of TasP more generally is low in Sub-Saharan Africa where the HIV burden is highest [<xref rid="pone.0295920.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], with countries&#x02019; governments hesitant to endorse the U = U message for dissemination within healthcare settings [<xref rid="pone.0295920.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to provide an in-depth exploration of the meaning of U = U for PLHIV and HCPs, and the barriers and facilitators to expanding U = U communication in South Africa.</p><p>Similar to previous studies, we found that PLHIV understand the health benefits of ART, with significant gaps in knowledge and only moderate confidence in U = U [<xref rid="pone.0295920.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295920.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295920.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].

While the U = U approach to VL communication can facilitate HCPs&#x02019; partnerships with patients to improve their self-management, the potential benefits of U = U on ART adherence and the mental and emotional well-being of PLHIV are likely mediated by U = U belief among current and prospective partners [<xref rid="pone.0295920.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295920.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, HIV-negative/na&#x000ef;ve persons in South Africa are largely unaware or sceptical of U = U [<xref rid="pone.0295920.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A recent study reported that HIV-negative partners were unwilling to stop PrEP or condom use even after their partners achieved viral suppression [<xref rid="pone.0295920.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The potential benefits of U = U on ART adherence behaviours and PLHIV wellbeing are likely mediated by U = U knowledge among current and prospective partners [<xref rid="pone.0295920.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Indeed, this was confirmed in a randomized trial in Malawi: disseminating information on TasP at the community level increased HIV testing by increasing people&#x02019;s beliefs about <italic toggle="yes">other community members&#x02019;</italic> TasP knowledge and reducing anticipated stigma. It is therefore necessary for U = U campaigns to combine clinical counselling with wider community-based dissemination to increase the VL literacy of communities and persons in PLHIVs&#x02019; network.</p><p>The hesitancy of HCP to disseminate U = U information is underscored by the lack of a concise and approved narrative for U = U counselling and fear of reprisal [<xref rid="pone.0295920.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The lack of a government-approved U = U communication strategy also leads to inconsistent messaging across the landscape of government and private/NGO-supported HCPs [<xref rid="pone.0295920.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295920.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. HCPs are also concerned about PLHIV&#x02019;s behavioural response to U = U, given current challenges with treatment adherence [<xref rid="pone.0295920.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Healthcare workers need support to adequately communicate U = U, adapting the message to individual patients&#x02019; lived experiences and health-seeking behaviours while remaining scientifically accurate and mitigating the potential for misunderstanding. However, there is no formal process or tool to assess and manage PLHIV&#x02019;s readiness for U = U information or narrative integrating U = U with established STI and pregnancy prevention messaging for PLHIV, their partners and the broader communities in South Africa.</p><sec id="sec021"><title>Limitations</title><p>While the information from HCPs was more broad-based, interviews with PLHIV were limited to the City of Johannesburg, and perspectives may differ in other areas of the country. Further research extending beyond the Gauteng province and even outside South Africa is essential to yield more universally applicable results, as communication strategies may require context-specific adaptations. Also, ART-experienced PLHIV recruited via U = U advocacy organizations likely has better-than-average awareness of U = U. Finally, as we informed participants that we were interested in designing an intervention to disseminate information on U = U, there was potential that desirability bias could shape responses by making people more favourable to U = U dissemination. In this light, the barriers that were identified are that much more significant to address.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec022"><title>Conclusions</title><p>With growing calls for U = U dissemination in South Africa, it is necessary to craft locally appropriate messages, modelling how to integrate U = U into people&#x02019;s lives. Also, for U = U to fully impact the ART cascade targets, it is essential to ensure acceptability among both HCPs and PLHIV by presenting U = U as symbiotic&#x02013;and not contradictory&#x02014;to current prevention strategies to achieve the desired population sexual health outcomes.
