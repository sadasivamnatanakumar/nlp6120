High A/T versus C/G content and frequent lysine and arginine repeats in the <italic>Plasmodium falciparum </italic>genome are thought to be the main reason for early termination in the mRNA translation process.

The analysis of various factors influencing the expression revealed that the time point of induction plays a key role in successful expression of A/T rich sequences into their native conformation. Contrary to recommended procedures, initiation of expression at post-log instead of mid-log growth phase generated significantly increased amounts of soluble protein of a high quality. Furthermore, these proteins were shown to be functionally active. Other factors such as temperature, pH, bacterial proteases or the codon optimization for <italic>E. coli </italic>had little or no effect on the quality of the recombinant protein, nevertheless, optimizing these factors might be beneficial for each individual construct. In conclusion, changing the timepoint of induction and conducting expression at the post-log stage where the bacteria have entered a decelerated growth phase, greatly facilitates and improves the expression of sequences containing rare codons.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Qualitative and quantitative production of proteins in heterologous systems is essential for the characterization of any molecule, from determination of antigenicity, functional and structural analysis to vaccine development. Malaria antigens are among the most difficult proteins to express with <italic>in vitro </italic>methods because of their extreme genetic codon usage. Different organisms have been applied for the production of malaria proteins, including <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], baculovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], yeast (<italic>Pichia pastoris </italic>and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], transgenic tobacco plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Among these, the <italic>E. coli </italic>expression system is the most attractive and most frequently used, because it quickly produces large amounts of biomass without sophisticated laboratory equipment and at low costs. However, the quality of many proteins expressed in <italic>E. coli </italic>has not been satisfactory. In many cases, the recombinant proteins are either expressed as truncated forms or precipitate in insoluble inclusion bodies in the bacterial cells. Although methods have been developed to obtain correctly folded proteins from these inclusion bodies, the process of refolding cannot be successfully applied to all proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Proteins expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus system are generally correctly folded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, so far only a few proteins have been successfully produced using this system because many proteins turned out to be toxic to the insect cells. In addition, the system achieves limited yields, which makes large-scale production cost ineffective. In recent years, expression of malaria proteins in yeast cells including <italic>P. pastoris and S. cerevisiae </italic>has been established in several laboratories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Recombinant CSP, MSP-119, MSP-1-AMA-1 hybrid proteins and the cysteine-rich inter-domain region (CIDR) of a <italic>Plasmodium falciparum </italic>erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) have been produced in <italic>P. pastoris </italic>for malaria vaccine studies in either primates or pre-clinical trials in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, for expression in <italic>P. pastoris</italic>, the codon sequences of these antigens need to be optimized. In most cases, sequences encoding for the amino acids of potential glycosylation sites have to be removed. So far, this system is the most promising one and might be the favourite choice when it comes to the production of recombinant malaria proteins under GMP conditions. It is nevertheless unlikely that this system will replace <italic>E. coli </italic>as a routine bench bioreactor due to its complicated manipulation and relatively long cultivation times. The use of long synthetic peptides (LSP) has been explored in malaria vaccine antigen production in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The advancing technology of peptide biosynthesis has made it possible to produce LSP with a high degree of homogeneity and purity. Furthermore, LSP can be designed in a way that they contain a large number of T cell epitopes, which leads to the generation of stronger CTL-mediated immune responses. However, this technology also has its limitations: it is still difficult to manufacture peptides that are more than 100 amino acids in length and proteins with multiple disulfide bonds are generally complicated to produce.</p><p>The <italic>P. falciparum </italic>genome is one of the most A/T-rich genomes. Surface exposed molecules expressed by the parasite such as members of the PfEMP1 family are positively charged, caused by the abundance of arginine and lysine residues in their sequences, which complicates their expression in heterologous systems such as <italic>E. coli</italic>. The high content of A/T repeats in the mRNA template is a reason for early translation termination and results in heterogeneity of recombinant proteins. Members of the PfEMP1 family are of great interest since they are virulence factors that mediate adhesion of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected erythrocytes in the post-capillary microvasculature, a process that leads to severe malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Each PfEMP1 molecule is composed of several Duffy-binding like domains (DBL) and CIDR domains. Both DBL and CIDR domains have a distinct number of cysteine residues and several lysine and arginine motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Molecular characterization, including antigenic analysis of this protein family, relies in most cases on the successful <italic>in vitro </italic>production of the correctly folded protein, and production of these proteins in the native conformation remains particularly difficult.</p><p>In most studies where <italic>E. coli </italic>was used as a bioreactor, it has been the main goal to reach as high expression levels of the recombinant protein as possible. However, high expression levels will not guarantee a high quality of the final product. Efficient expression of heterologous proteins in <italic>E. coli </italic>is impaired by the rarity of certain tRNAs that are abundant in the organisms from which the heterologous protein is derived [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. When the process of expression achieves high levels, the limited amounts of the tRNAs will quickly be exhausted. The lack of tRNAs will result in a drop-off of the ribosomal unit from the mRNA template and will terminate the translation process.</p><p>This study describes a simple method for optimizing the cultivation conditions and especially the timepoint of induction exemplified by the expression of several PfEMP1 domains in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Induction at the post-log stage of bacterial growth leads to the production of considerably larger amounts of soluble protein of a higher quality compared to standard conditions. Moreover, the method is easily applicable in laboratories where a sophisticated cultivation facility is not available.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Parasites</title><p>The <italic>P.falciparum </italic>parasite strains FCR3S1.2 and TM284S2 were cultured according to standard methods with 10% AB<sup>+ </sup>Rh<sup>+ </sup>serum added to the buffered medium (RPMI supplemented with Hepes, gentamycin and sodium bicarbonate).

In contrast, if the expression was induced at a higher OD A<sub>600 </sub>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, lane 2, 4, 6, 8), the dominant fraction of the protein was found to be the intact form, which proved to be true for all four domains tested although derived from different PfEMP1s.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of recombinant DBL, CIDR proteins expressed at mid-or post-log phase.

Proteins were in addition verified by Western-Blot both with anti-GST-and anti-DBL1-antibodies [26].</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1475-2875-3-50-1"/></fig><p>In bacterial cultures, the growth will be at log phase between an OD A<sub>600 </sub>of 0.3 and 1.5. During the log phase, the number of bacteria in the culture doubles approximately every 20 minutes. Afterwards, the proliferation rate slows down due to the lack of nutrients. If the induction is initiated while the bacteria grow in log phase, the bacterial translation machinery will be highly active and the expression of the recombinant protein follows this profile, because once turned on, the promoter controlling the heterologous sequence on the vector does not underlie further control mechanisms. During expression, the rare codons of arginine, leucine, isoleucine and proline frequently found in PfEMP1 sequences will inhibit the translation process, most likely caused by the exhaustion of the tRNAs for these amino acids. It has been reported that the rare codons of arginine and proline are likely to cause frameshifts and with that undesired products in bacterial expression system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The data reported here indicate that these problems mainly occur during the high-level expression stage, since proteins expressed at post-log growth stage are much less truncated.</p><p>Enzymatic digestion of heterologous proteins in <italic>E. coli </italic>is thought to be an additional reason for product heterogeneity of recombinant proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The experiments of this study could not confirm degradation by bacterial proteases as one of the major causes, since the use of a protease inhibitor cocktail in the purification protocol did not affect the pattern of the expressed products (data not shown). In addition, expression was carried out using a BL21 Codon Plus bacterial strain (Stratagene) that is deficient in the OmpT and Lon bacterial proteases.</p><p>We have previously found that a large proportion of the recombinant proteins remain in the insoluble fraction whereas only small amounts appear in the soluble fraction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and data not shown) if expression is initiated at an OD A<sub>600 </sub>of 0.6. To check whether the bacterial growth status at the induction timepoint has any effect on protein solubility, induction of expression was carried out on aliquots of the same bacterial stock culture at different bacterial densities (OD A<sub>600 </sub>value). Both soluble and insoluble fractions of the same culture were compared. The results (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;C</xref>) clearly show that the majority of the three recombinant proteins remain in the insoluble fraction when the expression was induced at an OD A<sub>600 </sub>below 2.0. If, on the other hand, the induction is initiated at an OD A<sub>600 </sub>greater than 2.0, almost the total amount of the recombinant proteins appears in the soluble fraction.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Impact of bacterial growth stages on protein solubility. The expression of the three recombinant proteins was induced at various timepoints chosen gradually from low OD A<sub>600 </sub>to higher OD A<sub>600</sub>. The comparison of the soluble and insoluble fractions of the recombinant proteins revealed that after initiation of expression at an OD A<sub>600 </sub>of greater than 2.0, the recombinant proteins are found almost completely in the soluble fraction. The amount of each protein loaded is not proportional to the size of the cultivation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1475-2875-3-50-2"/></fig><p>The solubility of a protein correlates with its correct structure that is formed during a post-translational folding process. Freshly synthesized polypeptides remain in a stage of intermediate form in the bacterial cytoplasma. After several enzymatic and biochemical processing steps, the peptides are folded into their functional form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, if proteins are folded incorrectly, they tend to accumulate as aggregates in the bacterial cell and, in order to avoid toxic effects on the host system, the bacteria store these aggregates in confined structures referred to as inclusion bodies.</p><p>Formation and accumulation of heterologous proteins as inclusion bodies is a common problem in protein expression. The exact mechanism of this process is still not understood. It has been suggested that factors such as culture pH, temperature and protein amino acid composition might affect the solubility of a recombinant protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The data reported here indicate that the expression speed and, with that, the subsequent folding process is the most important factor. Protein expression at the post-log phase resulted in high amounts of soluble protein, which indicates that at this stage the low bacterial growth rate implicates a biosynthesis process that is kept at low speed. The slow synthesis process will allow the protein processing machinery to efficiently assemble the freshly synthesized peptides into the correct structure. Correctly folded proteins are most likely to stay in the soluble form provided that the molecule does not contain large numbers of hydrophobic residues.</p><p>Although we found that the pH value of the growing culture is influenced by the amino acid composition of the expressed polypeptide, keeping a stable pH value in the bacterial culture does not affect the protein solubility (data not shown) and, therefore, has little influence on the quality of the expressed protein. However, temperature is an important factor to consider. Keeping the culture at 16&#x000b0;C before and after induction slightly improves the protein quality (data not shown), but, on the other hand, slows down bacterial growth considerably and therefore minimizes the final yield of the recombinant protein.</p><p>It has been reported that codon-optimized sequences for the use in <italic>E. coli </italic>will improve expression quality. Here we show that C/G versus A/T contents of the heterologous gene sequence are not among the most important factors that determine the quality of the recombinant protein. The expression of GST-DBL1&#x003b1; of FCR3S1.3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) optimized for expression in <italic>E. coli </italic>shows a very similar expression pattern compared to those ones of GST-DBL1&#x003b1; and GST-DBL2&#x003b2; of TM284S2 which were expressed using the wildtype <italic>P. falciparum </italic>sequences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B,C</xref>). This indicates that sequence composition is not always a determinant factor for expression quality.</p><p>We have previously found that the DBL1&#x003b1; domain of FCR3S1.2var1 PfEMP1 binds to the human erythrocyte surface through heparan sulfate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Further, the recombinant GST-DBL1&#x003b1; of FCR3S1.2 protein can be purified through binding to heparin-sepharose. In this study, the same amount of GST-DBL1&#x003b1; purified from cultures of expression started at an OD A<sub>600 </sub>of 0.6 and greater than 2.0 was tested for its ability to bind to heparin. Although the truncated forms of the DBL1 display binding to heparin due to the presence of heparin-binding motifs in these peptides, there is a remarkable difference in terms of binding affinity between the proteins expressed at different bacterial densities as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. Proteins expressed at a high OD A<sub>600 </sub>are not only more intact and more soluble, but also display higher affinity to heparin.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Binding to heparin. Recombinant GST-DBL1&#x003b1; of FCR3S1.2 was purified from cultures with induction at mid-log (lane 1) and post-log stage (lane 2) and bound to heparin.

The method reported here presents an easily applicable tool to express sequences containing rare codons. The key factor for the expression of such proteins is to decelerate the translation machinery inside the bacteria. Low expression speed will not only allow the ribosomal unit to smoothly pass through the mRNA templates and synthesize full-length polypeptide chains, but also enable the proteins to slowly transfer from the unstable intermediate phase to the correctly folded phase. The described expression approach will result in a final product that is soluble, intact and functional, nevertheless, additional factors might influence the expression and need to be optimized for each individual construct.</p><p>The expression of eukaryotic genes in <italic>E. coli </italic>is one of the most frequently used tools in modern science. Numerous approaches have aimed at achieving the highest possible level of expression by having a maximum amount of protein expressed per bacterial cell. Our studies suggest on the contrary that increasing the number of bacterial cells in the culture while at the same time keeping the expression process at a low profile, might considerably improve the quality and quantity of the protein. That way, high level expression can simply be achieved by increasing the bacterial density of a culture, whereby problems in form of truncated or insoluble protein factions are almost completely eliminated.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KF carried out the expression assays.
