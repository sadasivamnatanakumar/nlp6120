Destination marketers have a challenge to convey the tourist destination image to attract and satisfy the expectations of its visitors. Yet destination perceptions are often the result of multiple tourist visitor experiences at a location, neglecting the voice of the resident. The extent to which word associations varied by participants&#x02019; relationship to Glasgow was identified in terms of Aaker&#x02019;s brand personality scale, an extension of personality research on brands and destinations. Surveying of 1,219 UK participants generated a total of 5,993 terms (city; 1,144 unique) and 5,034 terms (people; 944 unique). The value of capturing the perceptions of a destination by its residents is identified. The results showed that the city of Glasgow was often described as cold and busy, while the people were primarily described as friendly and funny. Evidence was found in support of dual-processing theory suggesting word associations based on lived experiences of a city may be generated later (in terms of the order in which the terms were generated) in a word association task, while common linguistic associations (e.g. synonyms, antonyms, hierarchies etc.) tend to be generated earlier in the task. As hypothesised, analyses revealed a significant relationship between several of the Aaker-dimensions of brand personality, and the consumers&#x02019; relationship to Glasgow, extending marketing research with an empirical approach to identifying differences in the perceived personality of a destination. The study offers a practical, fast, and replicable method for destination marketers to study consumer perception at scale, which is currently not widely utilised in this field. In particular, the use of semantic distance and word embeddings provides a readily available approach to automatically categorise content derived from word associations studies, or indeed, any text-based content. In contrast, financial investment in non-validated branding and destination marketing campaigns appear to be increasingly problematic. Advances were made in testing an approach to interpreting word associations through the lens of linguistic and situated simulation (LASS) theory to provide deeper analysis to both categorise and interpret consumers&#x02019; perception. Traditional approaches to tourism marketing and destination branding rarely provide such a level of analytical appraisal. The analysis presented in this paper challenges the orthodoxy and validity of investment in brand and destination marketing at a city level and the potential for word association tasks to be used as a valuable alternative method to create more effective destination marketing and branding.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="11"/><table-count count="7"/><page-count count="30"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>The data underlying the results presented in the study are available from <ext-link xlink:href="https://osf.io/amscb/" ext-link-type="uri">https://osf.io/amscb/</ext-link>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>The data underlying the results presented in the study are available from <ext-link xlink:href="https://osf.io/amscb/" ext-link-type="uri">https://osf.io/amscb/</ext-link>.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>The rise of global urban tourism looked inexorable until March 2020 and the advent of the global pandemic. The closure of international borders and the reduction in air travel to control infection changed this growth trajectory. Urban centres emptied of workers, leisure tourists, business visitors and students. As the pandemic retreats, cities now face further challenges through inflation and energy crises, and an ongoing war in Ukraine and its impact on business and the global economy [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. For Glasgow, this has meant a reduction in visitation and tourism revenues [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], it has lost ground in terms of performance, ranking 118 out of 362 UK cities on competitiveness [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The effectiveness of city branding and destination perceptions, is particularly relevant to support the growth of a city. Perceptions of urban destinations are promoted through branding and destination marketing to encourage visitation and inward investment. In this paper, Glasgow is used as a case city, to test the value of a word association task to identify destination perception in the post-COVID-19 period.</p><p>Cities generate economic growth and are critical to national performance, urban tourism has been a further facet in building competitive advantage for progressive cities [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The combination of transportation and particularly air connectivity with other urban centres has ensured a regular supply of leisure and business visitors. As connectivity has become more cost effective, following the rise of budget air travel, the appeal of cities has continued to grow (Page and Connell, 2020). They combine significant leisure appeal including offering experiences in heritage, festivals and events, retail, nightlife with a range of cultural attractions. For business visitors, urban destinations offer; business locations, meetings, and conference centres as well as a range of potential markets and consumers concentrated in one location. Meeting Incentives Conferences and Events (MICE) tourism has become synonymous with cities as they constitute the primary locations of such business. A virtuous circle of leisure/business demand and transport connectivity has been the key to cities becoming major drivers of tourism.</p><p>The urban data produced by the World Travel and Tourism Council [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] confidently reported that global urban destinations were out performing all other locations. For those involved in marketing cities, the relationship between; <italic toggle="yes">Positioning</italic> (how the city should be perceived); <italic toggle="yes">Image</italic> (how people perceive the city); <italic toggle="yes">Branding</italic> (how the cities desired or aspirational image is expressed) and <italic toggle="yes">Promotion</italic> (how the city&#x02019;s branding is communicated) are considered critical [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295132.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. For most urban destinations the branding is a critical and iterative association that matures whilst embedding perceptions through various communications channels [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In Glasgow, the global COVID-19 pandemic changed this growth dynamic reducing urban visitation (Moffat Centre, 2021; 2022, 2023). In the UK accommodation occupancy and rates achieved were much greater in non-urban locations during 2021 and 2022 as leisure demand migrated away from cities in the immediate post-COVID-19 environment. Business and conference demand was also diluted by the continued use of online channels and the lower footfall within cities following work from home practice becoming embedded in general employment [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Defining and building a brand requires a clear understanding of perception in terms of the destination and its people who live there, across various demographics and relationships to the destination, yet such comparisons are rare, and tourists remain the subject of most tourism research, with local perceptions poorly represented [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Digital trace data generated when interacting with online media, such as Twitter, Facebook, Trip Advisor, <ext-link xlink:href="http://Booking.com" ext-link-type="uri">Booking.com</ext-link> and similar are a rich source of such perception, however, they are also archival and observational [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and not the results of a controlled process. One promising means of both generating new insights and testing existing theories, can be found through studies of free word associations, the space those words inhabit, and the company they keep (i.e. co-occurrence and collocation) [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295132.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Perceptions of Glasgow, and the ways in which those perceptions vary by way of the strength of the relationship to the city and its people, has to date, never been explored at scale, and represents a critical opportunity for destination marketers, especially given the novel challenges emerging from a post-COVID-19 world.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>2. Literature review</title><sec id="sec003"><title>2.1 Urban tourism</title><p>In 2019, Scotland evidenced its greatest rise in international and domestic tourism [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], invariably such growth can positively or negatively impact host, resident / native communities. Host communities&#x02019; acceptance of tourism development can influence destination performance [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Sharpley [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] identified notable tourism-specific factors, such as; type of tourism, density of tourists, or tourism dependency as elements impacting host perceptions. San Mart&#x000ed;n et al. [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] considered cities, regions or countries to be &#x02018;brands&#x02019; in the eyes of their populations. Marketers have a challenge to convey the tourist destination image to attract and satisfy the expectations of its visitors, yet destination perceptions are often the result of multiple tourist visitor experiences at a location [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, a focus purely on tourists and visitors omits the opportunity to obtain impressions from locals, whose identities define and are defined at least partially by the cities they inhabit [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Indeed, the growing trend among travellers to seek "&#x02026;authentic, experientially oriented opportunities with more meaningful interactions with locals" [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] would highlight significance. Thus, obtaining insights into how locals and visitors perceive urban destinations would appear to be especially timely in understanding urban appeal [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Urban tourism has been long associated with place branding and marketing [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and has been the subject of research ranging from its use in classic heritage cities such as Paris [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] to later emergent urban destinations such as Dubai [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In the case of Scotland, Glasgow&#x02019;s investment in place branding and resident and visitor perceptions merits review in the post-COVID-19 environment. Glasgow has been cited as a positive example of economic revival through urban tourism development [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295132.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This city, in redressing negative perceptions associated with post-industrial deprivation and manufacturing decline; reinvented itself as an urban tourism destination. The combination of visitor attraction development, staging of landmark events (including the 1988 Garden Festival, the 1990 European City of Culture to the 1996 Year of Architecture and Design and the 2014 Commonwealth Games) served to build awareness and drive visitation. The development of leisure tourism was balanced by investment in conference and meeting infrastructure, notably the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre (1986); which was followed by development of the Scottish Event Campus, following construction of the Armadillo meeting facility (1995) and the Hydro (2013) Performance and Conference Arena. The city also saw investment in tourism infrastructure that included major refurbishments of Kelvingrove Museum and Gallery (2006), development of the Riverside Museum (2011) and the Burrell Collection refurbishment (2022). During the same period significant investment was occurring in destination branding. Frequently, such investment has failed to recognise the complex range of motivations influencing choice [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Human motivation is extremely complex and decision making is multi-causational. Influences ranging from accessibility to visual appeal, price and security, wider media coverage and historical perceptions are combined with numerous other influences questioning the veracity of place marketing.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>2.2 Destination branding</title><p>Place marketing has largely been informed using qualitative analysis [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] although the work of Prebensen [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], is a useful exception. In the case of destination branding, the <italic toggle="yes">Glasgow&#x02019;s Miles Better</italic> place marketing campaign was associated with then Lord Provost; Michael Kelly [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and utilized the Roger Hargreaves&#x02019; Mr. Happy cartoon [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] in what has been seen as a cited example of successful urban marketing [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295132.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>This was followed in 2004 by the <italic toggle="yes">Glasgow</italic>: <italic toggle="yes">Scotland with Style</italic> campaign led by Greater Glasgow Tourist Board (GGTB). It was seen as a successful urban marketing body with a track record in sourcing, attracting, and hosting sporting, cultural and corporate conferences and events whilst promoting Glasgow as a desirable destination for leisure and business tourism.</p><p>The place marketing of Glasgow matured from the original slogan led, municipally inspired campaign to more aspirational approaches to city branding. The <italic toggle="yes">Glasgow; Scotland with Style</italic> campaign communicated a generic and flexible set of messaging about the city featuring; leisure, business, retail, dining, conferences and exhibition through sophisticated imagery and narratives.</p><p>This approach was based on an augmented Brand Wheel of place rationale and process (<xref rid="pone.0295132.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Such an approach highlights the current and aspirational perceptions of place using key descriptive words and phrases to guide destination marketing [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The Brand Wheel was used in a range of destinations at national level and regional level.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0295132.g001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0295132.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Brand Wheel (authors&#x02019; reproduction of the Glasgow visitor marketing Bureau 2004).</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0295132.g001" position="float"/></fig><p>The focus on the attributable value of style is important [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] with its symbolic and positive association with Glasgow architect; Charles Rennie Mackintosh.

As this was produced by brand consultants, who maintained commercial confidentiality in respect of derivation of content and descriptors making validation of the Brand Wheel impossible. The perceived success of the brand meant it was retained until 2016, featuring in the 2016 Tourism Strategy authored by: Glasgow City Council, VisitScotland, Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, Scottish Enterprise Glasgow and Glasgow City Marketing Bureau.

However, this was little more than attribution of all tourism expenditure over the period 2005&#x02013;7 whilst discounting any other factors that could motivate visitation. Any attempt to delineate and quantify the range of factors and influences causing consumers to visit Glasgow would be problematic. Such place branding exists to market city destinations whilst providing a unifying brand for stakeholders and business intended to positively influence consumer perceptions [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The <italic toggle="yes">Style</italic> branding was replaced in 2013 with <italic toggle="yes">People make Glasgow</italic> to broaden city coverage beyond the style and design orientation which, whilst favouring retail and design was proving less attractive to broader business and emergent financial sectors. This brand which has been in use continuously since 2013, provides a broad and flexible premise; <italic toggle="yes">&#x02018;People make&#x02026;&#x02019;</italic>. This can be combined with a range of sectoral meanings; <italic toggle="yes">People make Glasgow Welcoming; People make Glasgow Real; People make Glasgow Creative</italic>.</p><p>The premise being used to drive and influence perceptions, frequently combined with imagery, this drives a further positive association for the city. The value of destination perception is tested in this paper wherein word association on sample populations are used to consider effectiveness of such marketing investment. Traditional approaches to tourism marketing and destination branding rarely provide such a level of analytical appraisal [see for example <xref rid="pone.0295132.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>2.3 Word association</title><p>In tourism and travel research, word associations have been used to determine the perception of distant destinations [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295132.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295132.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], where such associations are understood to be shaped by the experiences, memory, and imagination specific to each individual [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Indeed there is evidence that perceptions vary substantially across native/indigenous populations versus tourists [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295132.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295132.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], not to mention how perception may vary among those who may only have heard about a destination and never visited. It follows that controlling for the conceptual variability among word association task participants regarding a destination cue may be of particular importance and relevance to tourism and travel research [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>One source of conceptual variability may be found in the process of generating associations themselves. Paivio&#x02019;s pioneering work on Dual Code Theory (DCT) hypothesised that both language and imagery work together strengthen associations and learning [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295132.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], while Barsalou, building upon DCT, found strong support for the role of simulation when generating associations, leading to the development of the linguistic and situated simulation (LASS) theory [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295132.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Linguistic associations may include properties conceptually common to a city such as <italic toggle="yes">large</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">busy</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], as well as properties that capture unique personal experiences, for example <italic toggle="yes">the pie-shop under the bridge</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This was further supported by the results of a Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study to chart the response types in the brain, finding that linguistic associations precede the richer, more individually situated simulations, e.g. <italic toggle="yes">pie shop</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. According to LASS, word associations utilise "alternative sources of information: the linguistic form system and the situated simulation system" [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Consequently, LASS predicts that the order of delivery of words in a timed word association task varies by way of the generating mechanism, with linguistic properties proceeding simulations. The present study employs LASS as a theoretical lens to both categorise and interpret the properties generated and provide an additional opportunity to test predictions made by the theory. To date, no study of destination marketing could be found exploring the role of generation order of terms in word associations studies, nor differences in personal associations versus culturally embedded interpretations of the city concept.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>2.4 Considering destinations as people</title><p>The Aaker brand personality scale is a tool used in marketing and branding to assess and measure the perceived personality traits of a brand. It comprises of five <italic toggle="yes">brand personality</italic> dimensions which are; <italic toggle="yes">Sincerity</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Excitement</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Competence</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Sophistication</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Ruggedness</italic> with each further extended by additional adjectives, resulting in a set of 42 descriptors [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Based on the premise that a location too is both a brand and can be described in terms of a set of human characteristics, several attempts have been made to apply the dimensions to destination branding. A study of the perception of two Spanish destinations among UK tourists confirmed the validity of all five of the Aaker dimensions [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295132.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295132.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], while a 2017 study of destination in terms of <italic toggle="yes">personality fit</italic> concluded that the match between tourists and the perceived personality of a destination serves to &#x0201c;reinforce the importance of strong and distinct destination personalities&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Although some attempts have been made to automatically infer the Aaker dimensions from social media content, for example considering personality and brand in Thailand [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], city branding responses to COVID-19 [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and the traits of world heritage sites [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], automated destination personality assessment represents a promising opportunity that has only begun to be explored.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>2.5 Self versus other: Residents and tourists</title><p>Although tourism research has traditionally focused on the perceptions of tourists, with the perspectives of other stakeholders, such as residents &#x0201c;underrepresented in the existing literature of place&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], the idea that perception may vary by relationship to a destination has been gaining traction in the literature. A study of the emerging tourist destination of Molise, Italy found substantial differences among residents and tourists in their perception of and propensity to recommend the location [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Similarly, while a study into resident versus international visitor perception of Thailand found both groups shared opinions regarding sightseeing, friendliness and food, visitors placed a higher importance on nightlife and entertainment than residents [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Indeed, a 2005 study of visitors to Florida found substantial differences not only in perception of residents, it also found differences across visitors in terms of U.S. domestic versus international [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Despite these findings, degrees of incongruence of opinion across residents and visitors may not apply universally, with a study of visitor and resident perception of Waiheke Island, New Zealand finding a high degree of congruency regarding perception of the island among visitors and residents [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. While it remains to be explored what the degree of (in) congruence might mean for a destination, the extent to which this might apply to the City and People of Glasgow represents an interesting research question, especially for destination marketers.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>2.6 Hypotheses</title><p>A key premise of this paper is the idea that &#x0201c;you shall know a word by the company it keeps&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The company a word keeps is defined by its semantic distance and location relative to other words as derived from large text corpuses, also known as word embeddings. For example, the word bee will often be found close to words such as hive, and sting, and less frequently close to the word metallurgy. Word embeddings allow for the meaning of words to be represented mathematically, and to facilitate computational approaches. In section 2.3 the potential to interpret word associations through the lens of LASS was considered, while in section 2.4, the role of brand as personality, using the Aaker model was considered. From both the theoretical perspective of LASS, and practical perspective of destination marketing, the following hypotheses will be tested.</p><p>H1: Word associations written later are predicted to be more distant from the city and each other.</p><list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>Last words are more distant to [Scotland], [Glasgow], [city] and [town] than first words across all respondents.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Word associations written later are predicted to be more distant from each another (greater variance).</p></list-item></list><p>Word associations generated later in the word association task by the by the respondent are more likely to be situated simulations (SS) than language associations (LA). Specifically, SS are predicted to be more distant from the core concept of city (extended to tests of Scotland and Glasgow as sub-categories) than LA, and to have higher variability (i.e., terms generated later will be more unique from one another in terms of average semantic distances than the average distances calculated for LA).</p><p>As discussed in Section 2.5, there is considerable evidence to suggest that how residents and visitors perceive a destination may vary substantially. Where the Aaker scale seeks to provide a universal instrument to capture the essence of a destination, the present study hypothesises that a destination may have two or even several personalities, when segmenting by relationship to the destination. It follows, therefore, that:</p><p>H2: Self-perception (<italic toggle="yes">residents</italic>) of Glasgow city and its people, and other-perception (<italic toggle="yes">visitors</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">never-visited</italic>) will differ significantly across coded brand dimensions. Terms generated by respondents will vary by relationship to Glasgow in terms of their Aaker distribution.</p><p>Following guidance around the preregistration of confirmatory studies regarding the potential value of including subsequent exploratory research or post-hoc analysis (e.g. <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/open-science/preregistration" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/open-science/preregistration</ext-link>) in addition to these pre-registered hypotheses, relationships and categories beyond the Aaker dimensions were explored, including differences across demographics as both original insights and opportunities for future research.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>3.

Most immediately relevant to the present study, it has also been used to explore tourist perception in blogs [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] and general tourism data mining [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].</p><p>To clean the raw word associations, and reduce complexity, several layers of natural language processing were applied. After removing special characters and redundant spaces, all typos were identified by collecting all the words that were not identified by an English dictionary library in python, the widely used programming language, and corrected manually. Furthermore, all plural words were converted to their singular form. As there was no standardized format to identify bigrams or trigrams, such as hard-working or down-to-earth, all possible combinations of bigrams and trigrams were collected programmatically and sorted by frequency. The n-grams that were most likely to be actual n-grams were then selected by the researchers.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>3.4 Distributional semantic networks and LASS</title><p>Distributional semantic networks (DSNs) utilize the co-location of words to generate a distributional topology of concepts as they naturally occur in human language generation, including the study of situated versus linguistic processing [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Associative strength is conceptualised in terms of the frequency of associations, for example if 45 out of 100 of people generate the word STING in relation to the cue word BEE, the associative strength would be 0.45. Such strong links are likely to be generated by linguistic mechanisms, whereas particularly weak intra-lexical links are likely to result in idiosyncratic responses [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. It follows then, that in terms of DSNs, words that are frequently collocated should have higher associative strength and be semantically closer to one another than those generated by the more idiosyncratic simulation system [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>].</p><p>In order to test the potential for automatic identification of situated simulations versus language associations, simulations are hypothesized as being the result of individual experiences and, therefore, less generic than language associations. This idea of uniqueness translates well to the idea of semantic distance whereby similar words (in terms of the frequency of their co-occurrence) will be semantically close, whereas less commonly co-occurring terms will have greater semantic distance, a notion that has been successfully applied to research around creativity (Beaty et al., 2022). This interpretation is strongly supported by the coding scheme from Santos et al. [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], which describes language associations in terms of word types expected to have a high co-occurrence (antonyms, synonyms, hierarchies, etc.). In this way, situated simulations are operationalised as having greater semantic distance from the core concept of interest (here, Glasgow) than language associations. To minimise bias through framing effects or anchoring, the survey began immediately with the word association tasks and follow-up questions were then presented later in the survey.</p><p>To calculate semantic distance, the cosine distance between two given word vectors was calculated using the well-known GloVe-algorithm [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], trained on the "fasttext-wiki-news-subwords-300" text corpus. In a similar fashion, the variance between all first and all last words, respectively, were calculated.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>3.5. Hypothesis testing</title><p>To test H1a, four t-tests for dependent samples were used to compare the distance of first and last words to each of the terms <italic toggle="yes">Glasgow</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Scotland</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">town</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">city</italic>. As each participant has two instances of first and last words from the two successive association tasks, the distance values were averaged over the two tasks before running the t-tests.</p><p>H1b stated that &#x0201c;Word associations written later are predicted to be more distant from each another&#x0201d;. To test this hypothesis, the variance of associations was calculated within the group of all unique first, and all unique last words, respectively. This was done by calculating the mean semantic distance of each word to every other word within that group, analogous to the methodology of Olsen [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. The difference in the average distances between unique first words and the average distances between last words were then tested using an independent sample t-test.</p><p>To test H2, a logistic regression was modelled on the data. The dependent categorical variable was relationship to Glasgow, with resident (1) and never visited (0), dropping the visitor&#x02019;s category to achieve two groups. Two separate models were run, one including only Aaker-dimensions and the number of words generated (to control for the fact that visitors may have used more words on average, increasing the probability of a positive significant effect). The second model used the same structure, but additionally controlled for sex, age, highest achieved education, and employment.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>3.6 Coding and sorting of words into Aaker-Dimensions</title><p>Traditionally, Aaker-Dimensions are measured by giving participants the opportunity to rate 5&#x02013;11 adjectives per dimension on a 5-point agreement scale [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The aim of this analysis was to see if we can generate Aaker-scores using the word associations. Specifically, we wanted to see whether semantic similarity algorithms could be used to meaningfully assign adjectives and nouns into each Aaker dimension. For this analysis, slang words were removed due to high ambiguity.</p><p>Negative words were also removed as the classical Aaker dimensions only contain neutral and positive adjectives. With the remaining set of words, the average semantic distance to all adjectives for each Aaker-dimension was calculated. Each word was assigned to a dimension with the lowest semantic distance if the semantic distance was below a certain threshold and hence sufficiently close to that dimension. The threshold was chosen by the authors, striking a balance between the inclusion of relevant words and the exclusion of words unbefitting the assigned Aaker-dimension. This left an array of words with a unique Aaker-dimension, and a list of words with no dimension.</p><p><xref rid="pone.0295132.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the top 15 words for each dimension. Each participant could have one, several or none of the Aaker dimensions, depending on how many categories are represented in their word-association. For example, a participant with the associations &#x0201c;busy&#x0201d; (Competence), &#x0201c;ice-cream&#x0201d; (None), &#x0201c;rough&#x0201d; (Ruggedness) and &#x0201c;tough&#x0201d; (Ruggedness), would be assigned a &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; for the Aaker-Dimensions of Competence and Ruggedness, and a &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; for Sincerity, Excitement and Sophistication.</p><table-wrap position="float"

Discussion</title><sec id="sec032"><title>5.1 On second thoughts (H1)</title><p>The order of words may indeed represent a greater or lesser focus on systems dealing with linguistic associations versus situated simulations. It was hypothesized that properties generated by linguistic mechanisms would necessarily be collocated more frequently (be semantically closer) with the cue word than those regarded as situated simulations or object-situation responses, due to the latter being more personal and individual (semantically distant). Following a similar rationale, Santos et al. [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] predicted significantly more unique terms would be generated by object-situation responses than linguistic system-based responses. Indeed, across all words, last words were more distant from all core concepts than first words, and 1.78 times as many unique terms were generated for last terms than first. Supporting the hypothesis that two systems may be active in word association tests, earlier associations appealed to more generally available conceptual models (thereby closer to the core concepts and less diverse in expression). Meanwhile, later associations appeared further from the core concept and were semantically more diverse.</p><p>This has an important implication for destination brand research: Rather than aggregating all terms and obtaining an average, looking at word order may help to induce dimensions of a destination that would otherwise be lost. These findings suggest that observing the emergence of situated simulation at scale may be achievable with readily available, cheap, and scalable computational methods. These findings lend themselves to replication studies as they may represent evidence for an important new relationship in the generation of concepts and related properties.</p></sec><sec id="sec033"><title>5.2 From marketers to people: Brand personality (H2)</title><p>The Brand Wheel (<xref rid="pone.0295132.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) distilled Glasgow&#x02019;s brand personality in 2004 into seven adjectives: <italic toggle="yes">Cosmopolitan</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Humorous</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Generous</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Outgoing</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Genuine</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Creative</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Embracing</italic>. As the Brand Wheel does not differentiate those that had never visited the city from local experience, or distinguish the city from its people, the current research tested self-versus other, for city and people, across the Aaker brand personality dimensions, and generated new personality dimensions that extended the Aaker framework (Tables <xref rid="pone.0295132.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295132.t007" ref-type="table">7</xref>). Furthermore, the research foundation of such attribution of adjectives in this original Brand Wheel was never made available. As noted, significant and noteworthy differences in perception were found across the Aaker dimensions for residents. In support of the Brand Wheel, the current research found Glasgow perceived as <italic toggle="yes">friendly</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">welcoming</italic> (embracing), <italic toggle="yes">funny</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">kind</italic> (humorous and generous), while the city itself was described as <italic toggle="yes">busy</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">cold</italic>. The range of predominantly positive and complimentary characteristics will rarely raise any objection but when compared with the perceptions and associations offered in this paper it is clear that negative and derogatory associations (aggressive, troublesome, cold) may be a more accurate reflection of urban perceptions.</p><p>It is also of interest to note that Brand Wheel positioning is essentially a marketing technique, and the availability of data regarding sampling and validation for the case of Glasgow is absent, making it impossible to interrogate the methods or results. However, incredulity is further extended in the Brand Wheel incorporation of statements and adjectives constructed around sub-sections:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>How the brand makes me Look.</p></list-item><list-item><p>How the brand makes me Feel.</p></list-item><list-item><p>What the product does for Me.</p></list-item></list><p>Around 25% of the variance in the relationship to Glasgow could be explained by differences in terms within the Aaker dimensions (Section 4.4.2, <xref rid="pone.0295132.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Sincerity</italic> was a positive predictor of a close relationship to the city, with those describing the people of Glasgow as sincere 6.3 times more likely to be residents. Contrarily, <italic toggle="yes">Sophistication</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Ruggedness</italic> were negative predictors, with those describing Glasgow as rugged over three times (3.24) less likely to be a (former) resident, and those describing Glasgow as sophisticated almost four times (3.8) less likely to be (former) residents. Finally, residents and former residents were considerably more gregarious in the generation of terms to describe the city. Overall, (former) residents and non&#x02014;visitors had significantly different views of the city across three of the five Aaker dimensions, indicating a clear opportunity for destination branding and marketing professionals to explore when developing campaigns. This gap can be seen when considering the Brand Wheel.</p><p>The contention that there will be a uniformity of perception in such areas simplifies the complexity of human perception and emotional response. The investment in such unvalidated and under theorised work is interesting when contrasted with the limited traction such terms enjoy amongst residents, visitors and non-visitors in the present study. The absence of the proposition: &#x02018;Full-on European City Experience&#x02019; along with almost all the other positively attributed descriptors raises concerns about the rigor of marketing campaigns over logical examination and research. Potentially mitigating some of the challenges noted, the present study also led to the generation of several new trends.</p></sec><sec id="sec034"><title>5.3 Exploratory analyses</title><sec id="sec035"><title>Football</title><p>Ranked fourth overall across all responses (<xref rid="pone.0295132.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>) after <italic toggle="yes">cold</italic> (first), <italic toggle="yes">busy</italic> (second) and <italic toggle="yes">city</italic> (third), it was the most frequently cited association for Glasgow City by age across all groups (<xref rid="pone.0295132.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>), top for men and second for women (<xref rid="pone.0295132.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>), and even by relationship to Glasgow (<xref rid="pone.0295132.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>), rated second to <italic toggle="yes">cold</italic> for non-visitors, top for visitors, and second for residents (second to <italic toggle="yes">friendly</italic>). The presence of Football as the most popular sport in the world for the last century which has been further propelled through media and digital channels (YouGov Sport, 2022, <ext-link xlink:href="https://sport.yougov.com/global-just-how-popular-is-football/" ext-link-type="uri">https://sport.yougov.com/global-just-how-popular-is-football/</ext-link>), should not be a surprise. The absence in the destination marketing literature of this common word association between football and Glasgow further raises questions about the distance between marketing hyperbole and the perception of consumers&#x02019; on the city of Glasgow.</p></sec><sec id="sec036"><title>Cold</title><p>Glasgow was also perceived as <italic toggle="yes">cold</italic>, across all demographics, with the strongest overall association for the city in the factor model (.584, <xref rid="pone.0295132.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). In fact, Glasgow&#x02019;s weather appeared so prominently that it managed to distinguish itself as an entire factor in the exploratory model. Although the top-rated term describing the city for non-visitors, and second for visitors, the <italic toggle="yes">cold</italic> did not make it to the top 20 terms for (former) residents (<xref rid="pone.0295132.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). What do residents see that visitors and non-visitors do not? At the top of the list, they think of Glasgow in terms of <italic toggle="yes">people</italic>, with <italic toggle="yes">friendly</italic> their most frequently cited term for the city.</p></sec><sec id="sec037"><title>Poverty and trouble</title><p>Table <xref rid="pone.0295132.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0295132.t005" ref-type="table">5</xref> (<xref rid="pone.0295132.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>) also indicate a category relating to trouble and poverty, while substance use featured in perception towards Glasgow&#x02019;s people in Tables <xref rid="pone.0295132.t006" ref-type="table">6</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0295132.t007" ref-type="table">7</xref>. Perhaps most telling, the association and frequency cloud for the People of Glasgow (<xref rid="pone.0295132.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11</xref>) highlights that prevalent negative associations remain. Despite the positive association with friendliness, Glasgow&#x02019;s history of substance misuse and violence remains. The differences in perceptions of city and people are also marked enough to warrant any city branding to consider both dimensions. Prior studies of Glasgow city appear to have largely ignored an anthropocentric approach to destination marketing, despite &#x02018;<italic toggle="yes">People make</italic>&#x02026;<italic toggle="yes">&#x02019;</italic> being the city&#x02019;s current strapline. What does this mean for Glasgow city, if <italic toggle="yes">people make it</italic>?</p></sec><sec id="sec038"><title>People make Glasgow</title><p>Response types varied when asked to consider the city versus its people, and the extended dimensions derived from modelling the terms used to describe Glasgow city and people provided two different models for each. For example, <italic toggle="yes">excitement</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">recreation</italic> (similar to Aaker&#x02019;s <italic toggle="yes">sophistication</italic>) can be found in perceptions of the city, whereas <italic toggle="yes">warm</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">gregarious</italic> (similar to <italic toggle="yes">sincerity</italic>) and <italic toggle="yes">hardy</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">aggressive</italic> and references to <italic toggle="yes">substance use</italic> (possible elements of <italic toggle="yes">Ruggedness</italic>) are found in perceptions of the people of Glasgow. A review of the words generated led to the development of two exploratory factor models for the city (Tables <xref rid="pone.0295132.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0295132.t005" ref-type="table">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295132.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>) and people of Glasgow (Tables <xref rid="pone.0295132.t006" ref-type="table">6</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0295132.t007" ref-type="table">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295132.g011" ref-type="fig">Fig 11</xref>). The words used to describe Glasgow, when modelled separately, provide a portrait of Glasgow that extends the perception of the city in terms of <italic toggle="yes">recreation</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">trouble</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">excitement</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">weather</italic>, while its people are <italic toggle="yes">warm</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">rugged</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">aggressive</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">gregarious</italic>, and invoke associations with <italic toggle="yes">substance use</italic>.</p><p>Despite marketing Glasgow in respect of people, through <italic toggle="yes">People Make Glasgow</italic>, when asked to think of the city and the people separately, only (former) residents extended the top cited term for people to their top association of the city (<xref rid="pone.0295132.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Friendly</italic> made it to sixth place for visitors, while it did not make the top 20 for non-visitors, suggesting the perception of Glasgow as a friendly city, may not have travelled conceptually. Despite this, Glasgow&#x02019;s people (<xref rid="pone.0295132.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>) were seen as friendly by all groups, so the absence of this connection to the city for non-visitors may suggest a failure of the people-centric marketing of <italic toggle="yes">People Make Glasgow</italic> to reach those unfamiliar with the city, or to make the connection that Glasgow is, largely, its people. This finding represents an opportunity for marketers to help others see Glasgow, as Glaswegians see it, considering Glasgow&#x02019;s people are already perceived as friendly and warm, seeing these terms rise in associations with the city itself would represent a viable measure of success for the campaign, while any associations of warmth, may help negate the frequency with which those less familiar with the city regard Glasgow as <italic toggle="yes">cold</italic>.</p><p>The fact that aggression, violence and drug and alcohol use were cited frequently enough to form their own factors, is also a motivating factor for future research. Indeed, the ruggedness ascribed to Glasgow, more prominently by outsiders than residents, may be impacting Glasgow&#x02019;s appeal. The perceptions of locals could make stronger connections with positive imagery and experiences.</p><p>The results suggest using both the city AND people question when conducting destination branding studies of this nature. Although people may make Glasgow, they are not inseparable from it in the minds of non-visitors, which may impact the overall perception of Glasgow as a preferred destination. Furthermore, such analysis challenges government agency expenditure on largely unvalidated and non-consumer tested campaigns. Forensic analysis of language and association will only help destination marketers produce more successful campaigns.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec039"><title>6. Limitations</title><p>The quest for representativeness remains a challenge regardless of the sampling strategy used with each having their own limitations such as response rates, online or data literacy and so forth [<xref rid="pone.0295132.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] and the present study is not exempt from such limitations. The present study was conducted using an online panel service, and as such, the findings may not generalize to another, or indeed, the entire UK population. Additionally, as the survey was voluntary, self-selection biases may limit the representativeness of the sample. By providing the data and codebook the authors hope to facilitate validation, alternate approaches to segmentation and general reuse.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec040"><title>7. Conclusion</title><p>The study contributes to theory and practice in several meaningful ways. In terms of theory, the paper proposed analysing word order in terms of semantic distance, as a means of identifying the extent to which respondents may have invoked memories (situated simulations) over common language associations in word association tasks (H1). Evidence was found in support of the idea that both greater average semantic distance from core concepts and greater uniqueness in terms generated may provide a workable proxy for identifying which systems of cognition may be active in a word association task (i.e. in terms of Dual Code Theory, language associations versus situated simulation) over costly approaches such as fMRI scans, representing a contribution to LASS theory, and grounded cognition. To date, the present study appears to be unique in considering the role of dual code theory on word associations applied to destination marketing. One practical implication of this finding (to be tested further in future studies), is that when looking at word association studies, the generation order of terms may indicate two levels of association: an immediate, more generic, and stable image of a city (through common language associations) and a spectrum of situated associations, offering opportunities for a more personalised approach to destination marketing. In short, the present study represents an initial foray into exploring the potential implications of dual code theory on the generation of word associations in the context of destination branding, and that differences may exist in personal associations versus culturally embedded interpretations of the city concept.</p><p>With regards to Aaker&#x02019;s theory of brand personality, the study contributes to nascent research into the multiple personalities a destination may possess, when considered from the perspective of an observer&#x02019;s relationship to the city and offers an opportunity to extend existing theory through recognition that relationships to a destination may substantially impact perception (H2). The study found evidence for <italic toggle="yes">a tale of two cities</italic>, and while the differences found were not as revolutionary as those in the Charles Dickens&#x02019; novel, residents appear to experience a subtly different Glasgow to that of visitors, or imagined by non-visitors. In subsequent exploratory analyses, possible extensions to the Aaker dimensions were also identified for Glasgow. The extent to which this may be true for other destinations, and particularly urban destinations, offers a rich opportunity to extend existing theory but also influence government agencies to target more effective destination marketing techniques. It is apposite that at a time of constrained resources in the UK the appropriateness of marketing investment that provides clear perceptual impacts can be scrutinised and judged.</p><p>Practically, while the failure of marketing professionals to appreciate the dichotomy is illustrative of the untested nature of such investment, it is also an opportunity. With regards to Glasgow and its people, the present findings question the orthodoxy of a city that has supposedly reinvented itself and moved on from violence, drugs and negative perceptions, while the simple dominance of football association, rather than any of the promoted marketing terms is also indicative of the superficial penetration of investment in destination marketing campaigns since 1983. Indeed, variations in perception from non-visitors to visitors or residents, illustrates a need to target these groups according to their familiarity with the city, and the presented methods provide marketers with tools to quickly obtain a snapshot into targeted perceptions.</p><p>Traditional approaches to tourism marketing and destination branding rarely provide such a level of analytical appraisal. The methods presented in this study offer destination marketers and researchers a simple, replicable approach to obtaining qualitative perception data in a controlled manner, at scale. Furthermore, the use of NLP detailed provides a fast and cost-effective way of matching associations to either predefined categories such as the Aaker dimensions, or any other terms of interest. In the case of Glasgow, these methods could be used to measure the effectiveness of campaigns such as <italic toggle="yes">Scotland with Style</italic>, by measuring the semantic distance of terms generated by respondents to the word <italic toggle="yes">style</italic>, or they could be used to identify potential terms for future marketing campaigns.</p><p>Despite the short time investment required to gather data for this study, the richness of insights and interpretation that could be derived were, arguably, disproportionately high with evidence for the perception drawn from both immediate associations and those derived from lived experience of the city. Automated destination personality assessment represents a promising opportunity that has only begun to be explored. Prior studies of Glasgow city appear to have largely ignored or omitted an anthropocentric approach to destination marketing.

</p><p>Dear Editor, </p><p>The changes requested have been made. The manuscript has been proofread and copyedited. Several points requiring clarification have been addressed. All comments provided have been considered and amended to the best of our ability. </p><p>On a side note, many thanks for your time, patience and effort, we are impressed by the level of dedication at PLOS One, and though this has required several iterations, we believe the manuscript has profited from the thoughtful comments provided. We hope with these latest changes that the manuscript now meets PLOS One requirements. If not, however, we will of course continue to amend as necessary. </p><p>Dr. Sean MacNiven</p><p>Specific responses (also in attached Word Document).</p><p>PLOS One: There are many imprecise or unclear expressions. I believe most of them are caused by language mistakes (e.g., in the sentence &#x0201c;The extent to which word associations varied by participants&#x02019; relationship to Glasgow was identified, in terms of Aaker&#x02019;s brand personality scale, an extension of personality research to brands and destinations.&#x0201d;, why did you put the comma before &#x0201c;interns&#x0201d;?). Another example: you misspelled the word &#x0201c;collocation&#x0201d; (row 61). You write &#x0201c;Covid&#x0201d; instead of &#x0201c;COVID-19&#x0201d;. Your manuscript should be rigorously proofread to be accepted. Those problems create the impression that your manuscript is not digested and also lead to serious problems with understanding your key statements.</p><p>Team: The manuscript has been proofread and copyedited for clarity. We hope there are no further issues, however, please flag any should you find them and we will correct (see the track changes version of the manuscript for all changes made). </p><p>PLOS One: For example, in H1, you state that &#x0201c;Word associations written later by the respondent in the timed response are more likely to be situated simulations (SS) than those earlier language associations (LA)&#x02026;&#x0201d;. Why did you put &#x0201c;those earlier&#x0201d; in that statement? If I understand your idea correctly, it should be,</p><p>&#x0201c;Word associations written later by the respondent in the timed response are more likely to be situated simulations (SS) than language associations (LA).&#x0201d;</p><p>Next, you write, &#x0201c;SS is operationalised in terms of semantic distance, with SS predicted to be more distant from one another (variance across terms generated) and the core concept of city (extended to tests of Scotland and Glasgow as sub-categories) than LA&#x0201d;. This sentence is completely unclear. What does it mean &#x0201c;from one another&#x0201d;? Again, if I understand</p><p>your idea correctly, it should be something like,</p><p>&#x0201c;Word associations written later are predicted to be more distant from each another.&#x0201d; </p><p>Maybe discussing that operationalization in the method section would be clearer.</p><p>Team: This has been rewritten for clarity. </p><p>In 2.6 Hypotheses: </p><p>&#x0201c;H1: Word associations written later are predicted to be more distant from the city and each other.&#x0201d;</p><p>AND</p><p>&#x0201c;Word associations generated later in the word association task by the by the respondent are more likely to be situated simulations (SS) than language associations (LA).&#x0201d; </p><p>H1b also rewritten as &#x0201c;Word associations written later are predicted to be more distant from each another&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x0201c;Specifically, SS are predicted to be more distant from the core concept of city (extended to tests of Scotland and Glasgow as sub-categories) than LA, and to have higher variability (i.e., terms generated later will be more unique from one another in terms of average semantic distances than the average distances calculated for LA).&#x0201d;</p><p>Also added the new working to the method section (3.5). </p><p>&#x0201c;H1b stated that &#x0201c;Word associations written later are predicted to be more distant from each another&#x0201d;. To test this hypothesis, the variance of associations was calculated within the group of all unique first, and all unique last words, respectively.&#x0201d;</p><p>PLOS One: It is unclear what the expression &#x0201c;Aaker dimensions are sufficient&#x0201d; means (row 321). It is also unclear what variables were involved in your Exploratory Factor Analysis. It is not explained in the Method section. It remains unclear in the Results section. E.g., how is the variable corresponding to the item &#x0201c;park&#x0201d; defined at the respondent level? (I suppose that respondents are units of your analysis).</p><p>You state that your exploratory analyses aim to address the research questions, &#x0201c;What other terms emerge in descriptions of Glasgow and its people, and how might these be used to extend of enhance the Aaker model?&#x0201d;. However, in row 321, you declare another aim of your exploratory analyses (&#x0201c;To see if the Aaker personality dimensions were sufficient.). This is inconsistent. By the way, the expression &#x0201c;other terms&#x0201d; (row 343) is unclear (other vs. what?).</p><p>Team: Now changed in Section 3.7 </p><p>&#x0201c;To see if the Aaker personality dimensions were utilised by the sample in their timed responses, an exploratory factor analysis with varimax rotation was run separately for both city and people as a method for investigating the co-occurrence of words. This was achieved by creating a binary column for each term of the word association task (for example, &#x0201c;park&#x0201d;), to indicate whether a participant had, or had not used the term. Then, to ensure that the words used had sufficient weight and relevance, words with fewer than ten occurrences were removed. Words that tend to appear together in the same response, were placed into a common category.</p><p>Removed this inconsistency. Now aligned with: </p><p>&#x0201c;In addition to the pre-registered hypotheses, additional ad hoc analyses were conducted to explore what other terms outside of the Aaker dimensions may have emerged in descriptions of Glasgow and its people, and how might these be used to extend the Aaker model.&#x0201d;</p><p>Also Section 7: Conclusions a sentence added: &#x0201c;In subsequent exploratory analyses, possible extensions to the Aaker dimensions were also identified for Glasgow.&#x0201d;</p><p>PLOS One: In the Results section, when you report on differences, please support them with statistical tests (e.g., rows 346-350). Instead of &#x0201c;p = 0.000,&#x0201d; it should be &#x0201c;p &#x0003c; 0.001.&#x0201d;</p><p>Team: This has been corrected. </p><p>PLOS One: The sentence &#x0201c;It is the absence of this powerful association in all of the destination marketing examined that is perhaps most telling and reaffirms the distance between marketing hyperbole and perception&#x0201d; is completely unclear. E.g., what do you mean by &#x0201c;powerful association&#x0201d; and destination marketing examined&#x0201d;?</p><p>Team: This statement was indeed sweeping and unclear, it has been reworded (Section 5.3): </p><p>&#x0201c;The absence in the destination marketing literature of this common word association between football and Glasgow further raises questions about the distance between marketing hyperbole and the perception of consumers&#x02019; on the city of Glasgow&#x0201d;.</p><p>PLOS One: Your Discussion section is dominated by exploratory findings, which seem disconnected from the main aim of your study (see, e.g., your Abstract). In general, my impression is that your study aims to investigate two issues related to destination image: (1) LA vs. SS associations in time and (2) the differentiation of destination personality between destination inhabitants and non-inhabitants. If so,two things should be improved. </p><p>First, the above aims should be reflected in the title, which can refer to Glasgow as an example (case) you use.</p><p>Second, the readers would like to see the research gap: how your findings advance the literature. Were those two issues studied before in the destination context? You do not explain that. For example, in the theoretical background section, you only say, &#x0201c;The present study employs LASS as a theoretical lens to both categorise and interpret the properties generated and provide an additional opportunity to test predictions made by the theory.&#x0201d;</p><p>Conclusions section, you say that &#x0201c;the paper proposed analysing word order in terms of semantic distance, as a means of identifying the activation of different systems in word association tasks.&#x0201d;</p><p>Does it mean that some previous studies on tourist destinations already evidenced the LA vs. SS associations in time, and your contribution is only the new method?</p><p>Team: This is an excellent point. Section 5.2 has been expanded and renamed &#x0201c;5.2 From Marketers to People: Brand Personality (H2)&#x0201d;. Similarly, Section 5.3 has also been renamed &#x0201c;5.3 Exploratory Analyses&#x0201d;. Although this section has not been shortened, all subsections have been collapsed into paragraphs. The discussion section now comprises three sections 5.1 for H1, 5.2 for H2 and 5.3 for the exploratory hypotheses. </p><p>The title has been changed to: &#x0201c;The Language of Marketing Hyperbole and Consumer Perception &#x02013; the Case of Glasgow&#x0201d;.</p><p>Section 2.3, added: &#x0201c;The present study employs LASS as a theoretical lens to both categorise and interpret the properties generated and provide an additional opportunity to test predictions made by the theory. To date, no study of destination marketing could be found exploring the role of generation order of terms in word associations studies, nor differences in personal associations versus culturally embedded interpretations of the city concept.&#x0201d;</p><p>No, this aspect had not previously been explored. We have now made that research gap clearer, and followed on from Section 2.3, in Section 7 with: </p><p>&#x0201c;To date, the present study appears to be unique in considering the role of dual code theory on word associations applied to destination marketing. One practical implication of this finding (to be tested further in future studies), is that when looking at word association studies, the generation order of terms may indicate two levels of association: an immediate, more generic, and stable image of a city (through common language associations) and a spectrum of situated associations, offering opportunities for a more personalised approach to destination marketing. In short, the present study represents an initial foray into exploring the potential implications of dual code theory on the generation of word associations in the context of destination branding, and that differences may exist in personal associations versus culturally embedded interpretations of the city concept.&#x0201d;</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0295132.s006" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers 20231018.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0295132.s006.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="pone.0295132.r007" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0295132.r007</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 3</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Trzebi&#x00144;ski</surname><given-names>Wojciech</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2023 Wojciech Trzebi&#x00144;ski</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2023</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Wojciech Trzebi&#x00144;ski</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0295132" id="rel-obj007" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
