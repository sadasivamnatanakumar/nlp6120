While such functional trade-offs are expected to influence evolutionary outcomes, their actual relevance in nature is masked by obscure links between genotype, phenotype, and fitness. Here, we describe functional trade-offs that likely govern a key adaptation and coevolutionary dynamics in a predator-prey system. Several garter snake (<italic toggle="yes">Thamnophis</italic> spp.) populations have evolved resistance to tetrodotoxin (TTX), a potent chemical defense in their prey, toxic newts (<italic toggle="yes">Taricha</italic> spp.). Snakes achieve TTX resistance through mutations occurring at toxin-binding sites in the pore of snake skeletal muscle voltage-gated sodium channels (Na<sub>V</sub>1.4). We hypothesized that these mutations impair basic Na<sub>V</sub> functions, producing molecular trade-offs that should ultimately scale up to compromised organismal performance. We investigate biophysical costs in two snake species with unique and independently evolved mutations that confer TTX resistance. We show electrophysiological evidence that skeletal muscle sodium channels encoded by toxin-resistant alleles are functionally compromised. Furthermore, skeletal muscles from snakes with resistance genotypes exhibit reduced mechanical performance. Lastly, modeling the molecular stability of these sodium channel variants partially explains the electrophysiological and muscle impairments. Ultimately, adaptive genetic changes favoring toxin resistance appear to negatively impact sodium channel function, skeletal muscle strength, and organismal performance. These functional trade-offs at the cellular and organ levels appear to underpin locomotor deficits observed in resistant snakes and may explain variation in the population-level success of toxin-resistant alleles across the landscape, ultimately shaping the trajectory of snake-newt coevolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Adaptation</kwd><kwd>Antagonistic Pleiotropy</kwd><kwd>Phenotypic Integration</kwd><kwd>Constraints</kwd><kwd>Toxin Resistance</kwd><kwd>Molecular Evolution</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Organismal performance is the integration of many intervening phenotypic steps that translate genetic variation into fitness<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.

Consequently, when selection acts on multiple phenotypes controlled by a single gene, mutations capable of producing phenotypes that overcome one selective demand must also largely preserve the encoded protein&#x02019;s structure so as to maintain all other molecular functions. When very few, if any, substitutions can accommodate this constraint, mutating a protein that underlies multiple key traits can produce phenotypic trade-offs, whereby adaptive change in one trait jeopardizes another (antagonistic pleiotropy) <sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.

While these structural changes produce effective resistance to TTX, they occur in highly conserved regions of the protein that are essential to channel function<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Therefore, we hypothesized that the highly conserved structure-function relationship of this critical protein constrains adaptive evolution in this system, whereby mutations that increase TTX resistance are deleterious to channel function and, by extension, physiological and whole-animal performance<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P5">Sodium channels are transmembrane proteins expressed in nerves and muscles that carry vital sensory and motor impulses<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>. The 24 transmembrane passes of these proteins form four voltage-sensing domains (see <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>) that dilate a central, sodium-selective pore through which sodium ions enter the cell, carrying a positive charge that depolarizes the membrane<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>.

However, mutations to Na<sub>V</sub> can have dire phenotypic consequences because many Na<sub>V</sub> functions are tied directly to protein structure, including selectivity to sodium, the rate of sodium influx by electrodiffusion, and sensitivity to changes in membrane potential <sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>. As such, sodium channel mutations are particularly hazardous, often resulting in serious congenital disease or stillborn progeny<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>. Dietary TTX has nevertheless driven the evolution of snakes carrying very effective Na<sub>V</sub> mutations, though functional variation is limited to just a few pore sites (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>,<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">d</xref>,<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">g</xref>) <sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>.

Thus, resistant sodium channels are expected to suffer from antagonistic pleiotropy<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. Indeed, previous correlational work<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> suggests that some populations of TTX-resistant snakes suffer locomotor deficits. However, the etiology of whole-animal performance costs remains obscure and has only been considered for a single group of TTX-resistant snakes<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. Work is needed to directly test the impact of naturally occurring Na<sub>V</sub> mutations, from the biophysical level to higher order physiology. To determine whether antagonistic pleiotropy creates functional trade-offs that may influence evolutionary outcomes, we need to understand how resistance-conferring mutations disrupt the sodium channel structure-function relationship, resulting in a cascade of performance deficits from molecules to phenotypic trade-offs at the organismal level<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P8">To identify the biophysical mechanism of higher order trade-offs, the molecular effects of TTX-resistant channels must be quantified and then connected to relevant physiological systems (<italic toggle="yes">i.e.</italic> skeletal muscle) to develop a framework that explains trade-offs at the whole-animal level<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>. Here, we assessed the biophysical costs of resistance-conferring mutations to the skeletal muscle voltage-gated sodium channel (Na<sub>V</sub>1.4), primarily finding mutant channels produce less bioelectricity (reduced unitary conductance) and are therefore less able to excite skeletal muscle compared to their TTX-sensitive counterpart. We then investigated mechanical deficits that scale up from effects seen at the molecular level, revealing reduced force output and slowed mechanical activity of skeletal muscle in toxin-resistant snakes. Lastly, we examine how these structural mutations alter the interaction energy dynamics of functional residues in the sodium channel, offering insight into the molecular mechanism of this phenotypic trade-off. The evidence of this trade-off is reproducible across two independently evolved resistant snake species with unique resistance alleles and may underlie the heterogeneous landscape-level distribution of toxin resistance<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. We conclude that performance trade-offs at the molecular level are the proximate source of higher-order limitations that give rise to constraints on natural selection, and in so doing, comprise a straightforward map from gene sequence to evolutionary consequence.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Resistant channels produce less current than their toxin-sensitive counterpart</title><p id="P9">We tested the hypothesis that mutations in the highly conserved sequence of the sodium channel pore (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">d</xref>, <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">g</xref>; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>) underlie organ- and higher-level performance deficits. We characterized two suites of mutations in skeletal muscle voltage-gated sodium channels (Na<sub>V</sub>1.4) associated with the greatest levels of organismal TTX resistance seen in two species of <italic toggle="yes">Thamnophis</italic><sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. We assessed the electrophysiology of the conserved, TTX-sensitive channel (Na<sub>V</sub>1.4<sup>+</sup>, <italic toggle="yes">Rattus norvegicus</italic>) and two TTX-resistant channel mutants: Na<sub>V</sub>1.4<sup>EPN</sup> (D1241E, A1245P, and D1532N) and Na<sub>V</sub>1.4<sup>LVNV</sup> (I1520L, I1525V, D1532N, and G1533V) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>).

As expected, we found that these snake mutations confer strong TTX resistance to the rat channel relative to the conserved protein (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). In search of a possible source of trade-offs, we began by assessing the activation and inactivation parameters of sensitive and resistant channels.</p><p id="P10">Sodium channels activate in response to depolarizing membranes. Mutations can change the flexibility of the protein, thereby potentially dampening or facilitating the channel&#x02019;s conformational changes in response to depolarization. Muscle weakness could arise from mutations that cause the sodium channel to be less responsive to depolarization (&#x0201c;hypoexcitability&#x0201d;). The resting membrane potential of skeletal muscle is very negative, varying across phyla from &#x02212;70mV to nearly as low as &#x02212;90mV<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>. At such negative resting potentials, healthy sodium channels should remain closed, but ready to open<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup>. When an organism intends to contract a voluntary skeletal muscle, peripheral nerves release acetylcholine onto the neuromuscular junction, depolarizing the postsynaptic membrane through the action of ionotropic Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors (nAChR)<sup><xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup>. The brief currents raise the local transmembrane voltage. For any sodium channels near enough to be under the electrical influence of this depolarization, the positively-charged residues in the voltage-sensing domains of Na<sub>V</sub> are repelled extracellularly by this more positive (less negative) internal potential. The conformational change in the voltage-sensing domains applies torsion to the pore-forming domains, dragging them radially outward, thus dilating the channel enough to conduct hydrated sodium ions, producing a current that propagates the depolarizing wavefront<sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup>. The voltage at which a population of sodium channels opens in near unison defines the &#x0201c;threshold&#x0201d; of an action potential. Channels exhibiting a higher threshold (lower sensitivity to depolarization) will result in muscles that require a greater stimulus to produce a contraction. Thus, the voltage sensitivity of sodium channel activation is a reasonable target for the investigation of trade-offs in toxin resistant snakes.</p><p id="P11">In whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology experiments where transmembrane voltage is controlled by an external amplifier, the population of channels in the membrane is held at a constant voltage, conditioning the proteins into nearly uniform molecular configurations. At potentials near or more negative than rest, the voltage-sensing domains are pulled intracellularly, cinching the pore-forming domains, preventing channel patency<sup><xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup>. As test potentials are increasingly depolarized (<italic toggle="yes">i.e.</italic> sequentially more positive), greater and greater proportions of the sodium channel population will respond to the activating stimulus, resulting in macroscopic sodium currents that are larger in magnitude. The development of sodium currents from a population of channels conditioned into an equilibrium of nearly uniform conformational states is referred to as &#x0201c;steady-state activation.&#x0201d;</p><p id="P12">Any mutation near the pore or voltage-sensing domains could feasibly alter the rigidity or flexibility of this orchestrated molecular reconfiguration, thereby requiring greater or lesser depolarizing potentials to achieve the same magnitude of sodium current. However, we found that the voltage dependence of steady-state activation is identical across all sodium channel variants observed in this study (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>). That is to say, across a range of membrane potentials from &#x02212;80mV to +80mV, equivalent proportions of both sensitive and resistant sodium channel populations respond to the same depolarizing stimulus. Therefore, voltage sensitivity of activation does not explain higher order locomotor deficits.</p><p id="P13">In addition to activating in response to depolarization, healthy sodium channels inactivate in time- and voltage-dependent manners<sup><xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup>. Under normal circumstances, this is achieved by a hydrophobic intracellular loop that becomes mobile once the channel is activated, contorting to occlude the channel pore from the intracellular face, preventing further passage of sodium despite voltage-sensing domains remaining in the activated conformation<sup><xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup>. The total macroscopic current decays within a few milliseconds as inactivation stochastically sets in for all sodium channels throughout the membrane, known as &#x0201c;fast inactivation&#x0201d;<sup><xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup>. Slow inactivation takes place over much longer time scales and provides a less convincing etiology for trade-offs in toxin-resistant snakes<sup><xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup>. Once inactivated, sodium channels are very unlikely to return to a conducting state until the membrane potential returns to near or below rest, resetting the voltage-sensing domains and removing the hydrophobic inactivation gate. If a mutation were to cause premature inactivation, perhaps by increasing the mobility of the inactivation gate, then less overall current would pass through the membrane, thereby limiting the depolarizing power of the sodium channel and hampering the excitability and contractility of skeletal muscle.</p><p id="P14">TTX resistance mutations in snakes are found on the extracellular face of the channel pore, separated from the inactivation gate on the intracellular face<sup><xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref></sup>. Therefore, pore-domain mutations are not known to affect the voltage-dependence of fast inactivation, which is consistent with our findings here (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></sup>. However, holding voltage constant, we do see that one resistant variant inactivates more quickly than others (Supp. Fig. 1g,h). While the triple-point mutant (<italic toggle="yes">R.n.</italic>Na<sub>V</sub>1.4<sup>EPN</sup>) exactly follows the inactivation rate of the ancestral TTX-sensitive channel (<italic toggle="yes">R.n.</italic>Na<sub>V</sub>1.4<sup>+</sup>), the quadruple-point mutant (<italic toggle="yes">R.n.</italic>Na<sub>V</sub>1.4<sup>LVNV</sup>) enters steady-state inactivation significantly faster than the TTX-sensitive channel. This premature onset of fast inactivation in one toxin-resistant channel may underlie higher-order physiological deficits unique to <italic toggle="yes">Thamnophis sirtalis</italic> (described later). Assessing how quickly inactivation can be removed in these mutant channels, we find that neither the rate (Supp. Fig. 2) nor the voltage dependence of recovery from inactivation (Supp. Fig. 2) are affected by these pore-domain mutations. Thus, these distinct resistance-conferring p-loop mutations appear to exert unique effects on some channel functions while entirely sparing others. However, with identical steady-state activation and faulty inactivation in only one of the two mutants, these findings alone are insufficient to explain all locomotor deficits in both <italic toggle="yes">Thamnophis atratus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Thamnophis sirtalis</italic>.</p><p id="P15">Without evidence supporting a kinetic explanation for locomotor deficits (Supp. Fig. 1a-d), then the magnitude of sodium currents, and thus the excitability and contractility of skeletal muscle, must be determined by other fundamental properties of Na<sub>V</sub>. Across the current-voltage relationship, TTX-resistant channels produce far less macroscopic current than their toxin-sensitive, conserved counterpart (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>, 30% less in <italic toggle="yes">R.n.</italic>Na<sub>V</sub>1.4<sup>EPN</sup> and 50% less in <italic toggle="yes">R.n.</italic>Na<sub>V</sub>1.4<sup>LVNV</sup>). However, this global, macroscopic current can be decomposed into three variables: how many channels are active in the membrane (N), the maximum statistical likelihood of finding any of the N channels open (P<sub>o,max</sub>), and how much sodium current each individual channel conducts when it is actually open (unitary conductance, or g<sub>Na</sub>)<sup><xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></sup>. The most expedient electrophysiological technique to measure these variables is Non-Stationary Noise Analysis (NSNA, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>)<sup><xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></sup>. Assuming all sodium channels encoded by the same allele perform roughly identically, then any variation in macroscopic current not otherwise attributable to thermal, electromagnetic, or vibrational noise, should be quantal: one open sodium channel always produces the same amount of current. Therefore, by taking an average of the inactivating phase of an ensemble of 1000 sodium currents evoked under identical conditions, the statistical variance of the inherent noise around the mean is proportional to the unitary current of the sodium channel. If activation and inactivation determine at what voltages sodium channels open and for how long they remain open, then the unitary current determines the amount of sodium that can flow per unit time and likely underlies the differences in macroscopic currents observed here between ancestral and mutant channels (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p><p id="P16">Through NSNA, we found median single channel conductance, g<sub>Na</sub>, (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>) to be significantly reduced in toxin-resistant mutants (29.3% in <italic toggle="yes">R.n.</italic>Na<sub>V</sub>1.4<sup>EPN</sup>, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.0318; 53.6% in <italic toggle="yes">R.n.</italic>Na<sub>V</sub>1.4<sup>LVNV</sup>, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 8.84&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) without significant changes in channel number, N, (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2h</xref>, Supp. Fig. 1f) or peak open probability, P<sub>o,max</sub> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2i</xref>, Supp. Fig. 1.e).

While the triple-point mutant, Na<sub>V</sub>1.4<sup>EPN</sup>, is comparably stable at these sites (&#x02212;366.84 kj/mol), the quadruple-point mutant, Na<sub>V</sub>1.4<sup>LVNV</sup>, is substantially destabilized (&#x02212;42.43 kj/mol). In fact, Na<sub>V</sub>1.4<sup>+</sup> and Na<sub>V</sub>1.4<sup>EPN</sup> demonstrate residue pairings whose combined interaction energies are therefore 6.43x and 6.30x more stable, respectively, than the sum of the interaction energies between the same six sites in Na<sub>V</sub>1.4<sup>LVNV</sup> (Supp. Table 12).</p><p id="P24">When decomposing these total interaction energies into their component interactions, it becomes clear that N1539 strongly destabilizes both Na<sub>V</sub>1.4<sup>EPN</sup> and Na<sub>V</sub>1.4<sup>LVNV</sup>, accounting for the loss of 122.91 kj/mol stability in Na<sub>V</sub>1.4<sup>EPN</sup> and 148.54 kj/mol in Na<sub>V</sub>1.4<sup>LVNV</sup>. However, in Na<sub>V</sub>1.4<sup>EPN</sup>, E1248 counteracts the instability conferred by N1539. While the conserved residues at positions 1527, 1532 and 1540 each have small, destabilizing interactions with N1539, E1248 interacts favorably with all four residues (I1527, I1532, N1539, and G1540). In fact, the most destabilizing interaction for E1248 is with its nearby neighbor, P1252, also found in resistant <italic toggle="yes">Th. atratus</italic> channels. So, while D1539N reduces the total favorable interaction energy at site 1539 by 86.4% in Na<sub>V</sub>1.4<sup>EPN</sup>, D1248E increases the favorable interaction energy by 353.6%.

The majority of lost stability in Na<sub>V</sub>1.4<sup>LVNV</sup> (&#x00394;&#x00394;G=+351.41 kj/mol) can be explained by destabilizing interactions between three hydrophobic pairings (L1527-F412, V1532-Y1581, and V1540-G1512) and a hydrophilic interaction (N1539-K1244) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). L1527 most likely interferes with the Domain I pore loop residue, F412, due to crowding by the bulky dimethyl group of leucine compared to the single methyl terminus of isoleucine. However, changes in residue volume may not completely explain why V1532 interacts negatively with the aromatic Y1581 of Domain IV S6. Rather, V1532 possesses a stronger attraction to a nearby L1541 in the ascending pore loop than isoleucine does in the toxin-sensitive channel. V1532 is consequently contorted by its interaction with L1541 and interferes with the hydrophilic hydroxyl group on Y1581, thereby yielding an unfavorable interaction. Further, V1540 negatively interacts with G1512 found on an extracellular loop, mostly likely due to steric hindrance compared to the ancestral glycine. Lastly, N1539 demonstrates a deleterious interaction with the positively charged residue, K1244, a key residue that constitutes the Domain III selectivity filter (the &#x0201c;K&#x0201d; of DEKA).

Pore-domain mutations on the extracellular face would not be expected to exert direct effects on the activation and inactivation gates near the intracellular face. Indirectly, however, the interior aspect of the pore loops interface with the S5 and S6 helices through hydrophobic interactions, which in turn, directly interact with the activation and inactivation gates (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, some aspects of steady-state kinetics can be mechanistically explained by interaction energies between the p-loops and the S5/S6 helices.</p><p id="P28">The activation gate, a group of hydrophobic amino acids near the intracellular face of the pore, is dilated following the molecular reorganization of the voltage-sensing domains during depolarization.

Our electrophysiological and myographical data suggest that Na<sub>V</sub>1.4<sup>LVNV</sup> inactivates prematurely.

From the intracellular face, the IFM particle interacts through hydrophobic forces with A1152 (DIII S5) and F1305 (DIII S6). From above, closer to the ion-conducting pathway, the IFM particle interacts, again through hydrophobic forces, with A1481 (DIV S5) and I1594 (DIV S6). As expected, with the pore mutations far away from the inactivation gate, the interaction energies between the IFM particle and the DIII and DIV S5/S6 residues are virtually identical across all channel variants studied here. Thus, differences in tendencies toward inactivation must arise from indirect effects of the pore-domain mutations, likely due to differences in the mobility of S5/S6 domains during the molecular reorganization that initiates inactivation.</p><p id="P30">The intracellular ends of the DIII and DIV S5 and S6 helices cradle the IFM particle while the extracellular ends of those same transmembrane &#x003b1;-helices form direct hydrophobic interactions with the interior aspect of the reentrant p-loops (Figure 6).

Over both Domains III and IV, there are 44 key residues linking the p-loops to the S5/S6 helices. To mobilize the inactivation gate, Na<sub>V</sub>1.4<sup>+</sup> channels must overcome the total interaction energy of those 44 residues (&#x02212;4044.23 kj/mol) (Supp. Table 14).

We injected TTX starting at 1 MAMU for snakes from known low-resistance populations and 10 MAMU from known high-resistance populations. The dose was then serially increased (3, 5, 10 and sometimes 15 or 25 MAMUs for low-resistance; 25, 50, 100 or 250 MAMUs for known high-resistance). For individuals with exceedingly great resistance, the dose-response protocol was truncated to 250 MAMU to avoid potentially irreversible damage to the animal and preserve costly toxin reserves. The dose of TTX needed to slow an individual to 50% of its baseline sprint speed is reported as the 50% MAMU (analogous to a 50% inhibitory concentration, IC<sub>50</sub>).</p><p id="P43">Here, 50% MAMU was calculated by fitting the dose-responses to a sigmoidal curve.

The dose for baseline speed (0 MAMU TTX) was revised to 0.1 MAMU to abide by the limitations of the natural logarithm. A minimum of five (5) dose responses is needed to fulfill this model. Where conditions precluded the administration of more than three (3) doses of TTX, the sigmoidal fit was forced by including sufficiently large doses where speed is assumed to converge to zero m/s.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Genotyping</title><p id="P44">Regions of <italic toggle="yes">SCN4A</italic> corresponding to the third and fourth pore domains of Na<sub>V</sub>1.4 (DIII-PD &#x00026; DIV-PD) were sequenced for all snakes.

In UCSF Chimera, all 356 point mutations were made to the human structure to generate a homology model that approximates the snake channel structure (ignoring differences in the C and N termini)<sup><xref rid="R90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref></sup>. This &#x0201c;serpentized&#x0201d; homology model therefore uses the human residue positioning numbers. Therefore, to recreate the mutations found in TTX-resistant snake Na<sub>V</sub>1.4 Domains III and IV of <italic toggle="yes">Th. atratus</italic> (D1277E, A1281P, and D1568N), the toxin-sensitive model was mutated at D1248E, A1252P, and D1539N. To recreate the Domain IV mutations of <italic toggle="yes">Th. sirtalis</italic> (I1556L, I1561V, D1568N, and G1569V), the toxin-sensitive model was mutated at I1527L, I1532V, D1539N, and G1540V. All three of these models were then run through UCSF Chimera&#x02019;s standard Minimize Structure routine to produce three optimized, <italic toggle="yes">Thamnophis</italic> homology models for and Na<sub>V</sub>1.4<sup>+</sup>, Na<sub>V</sub>1.4<sup>EPN</sup>, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.4<sup>LVNV</sup>. Each of these models was then uploaded to the Interaction Energy Matrix (IEM) Web Application (<ext-link xlink:href="https://ip-78-128-251-188.flt.cloud.muni.cz/energy/" ext-link-type="uri">https://ip-78-128-251-188.flt.cloud.muni.cz/energy/</ext-link>)<sup><xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref></sup>. For all six positions in question (residues 1248, 1252, 1527, 1532, 1539, and 1540), the interaction energy of each mutation was calculated by the IEM program for each minimized model, accounting for both Coulombic and Lennard-Jones modeled Van der Waals forces. Furthermore, the total interaction energies of several key residues linking the pore-domain and the S5/S6 domains of the sodium channel, that in turn link to the inactivation gate, were also calculated. The &#x00394;&#x00394;G was calculated here using the ancestral, toxin-sensitive model as the reference. Residues that carry a more negative interaction energy (i.e. more stable) than the ancestral residue produce negative values while substitutions that destabilize the interaction energy relative to the ancestral protein produce positive values. Here, key residues were identified due to their known functional significance or by physical proximity when two atoms on adjacent residues lie within 5&#x000c5; of one another.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S30"><title>Solutions</title><p id="P70">All experiments on skeletal muscle tissue were performed in Krebs buffer of the following composition (in mM): 145 Na<sup>+</sup>, 127.7 Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, 25 HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>, 5.5 glucose, 5.4 K<sup>+</sup>, 1.2 Mg<sup>2+</sup>, 1.8 Ca<sup>2+</sup>, 1.2 H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>, 1.2 SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#x02212;</sup> and supplemented with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> to achieve pH ~7.35.

However, all statistical tests were performed using nonparametric analysis of variance in R 3.5.1 (R Core Team 2017) using Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA and Dunn&#x02019;s multiple comparison post hoc test. Nonparametric methods were employed for all tests given that not all data were normally distributed. Statistical significance was determined by comparing the control and mutant groups using the Kruskal-Wallis test with &#x003b1; = 0.05. Preliminary experiments used to secure funding suggested that the effect size between resistant and sensitive animals would be sufficiently large to forego an effect size calculation or other power analysis. All test statistics and observation counts (n) can be found in Supplemental Tables 3&#x02013;11 in the data repository below.
