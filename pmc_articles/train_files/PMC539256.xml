In the first year after germination, a rosette of leaves develops while the taproot swells and accumulates sucrose. In the second year, flower initiation is induced after vernalization in the preceding winter. Beets are harvested at the end of the first year when sugar content of the taproot is high. Transgenic approaches towards modification of specific traits comprise the increase of pathogen resistance, the increase of sugar content and the improvement of sugar storage. These approaches require promoters that direct gene expression in a timely and spatial manner which is determined by the desired expression profile of the transgene.</p><p>In many cases improvement of transgenic traits in plants were achieved by using specific promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, to accomplish high tissue specific protein production in transgenic plants, often promoters from photosynthetic or storage specific genes are employed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>For the identification of desired promoters, a subtractive approach to enrich differentially expressed genes or a large scale approach to identify these genes in cDNA libraries may be employed prior to promoter isolation. One possible way to identify nonredundant clones in a cDNA library is the method of oligonucleotide fingerprinting (ofp) which was recently applied to sugar beet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. With this approach different cDNAs can be identified on a large scale basis within a cDNA library. While a large scale ofp approach is a feasible method to identify differentially expressed genes in different cDNA libraries, this method is very cost intensive and hence not applicable for many research groups.</p><p>A straight forward approach for the isolation of differentially expressed genes was achieved by the "Suppression Subtractive Hybridization" method (SSH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. SSH is a cDNA- and a PCR-based technique that includes a step for the equalization of the abundance of different cDNA fragments during subtractive hybridization. Combined with suppression PCR, selective amplification of differentially expressed cDNA sequences was achieved without the application of physical separation methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This method was recently applied to isolate taproot expressed genes from sugar beet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Here we have employed SSH for the isolation of leaf expressed sugar beet genes. Among the genes isolated was a cDNA fragment for a light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding protein (CAB). It is shown that sugar beet genotypes harbor either one or two <italic>cab </italic>genes that are both expressed. To investigate the use of the <italic>cab </italic>promoters for gene expression, the 5' regulatory sequences were isolated and linked to reporter genes. Transient reporter gene assays indicate that both promoters are expressed in sugar beet leaves. In transgenic sugar beet both promoters are expressed in green tissue. Sequence analysis revealed that the <italic>cab</italic>11 promoter, in contrast to the <italic>cab</italic>12 promoter, is void of G-box like regulatory sites with a palindromic ACGT core sequence. A leaf specific promoter in transgenic sugar beets can be employed for biotechnological applications.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of leaf expressed genes from sugar beet</title><p>To isolate cDNA fragments corresponding to leaf expressed genes, poly(A)+RNAs from leaf and taproot were isolated and subjected to cDNA synthesis. Suppression subtractive hybridization was performed as described in Methods. A total of 23 cDNA clones specific for the subtraction for leaf expressed genes were isolated and sequenced (data not shown). Fourteen out of 23 cDNAs were found to be different. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> shows that 10 out of these 14 clones have homology mainly to nuclear encoded genes involved in the calvin cycle and in photosynthesis. Fragments L6 and L11 detect homology to the same gene but do not overlap. Four clones do not have any sequence homology to a known gene.</p><p>To further confirm that the enriched cDNA fragments correspond to tissue specific genes, Northern blot hybridizations to total RNA isolated from leaves (L), taproots (R), stems (S), and inflorescences (I) were performed with 7 cDNA fragments. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows that all but one of the cDNA fragments hybridize specifically or much stronger to RNA from leaves than to RNA from taproots. Clone L5 hybridizes with similar intensity to RNA from all four tissues.</p><p>The expression profile of the gene for SSH fragment L2 encoding a chlorophyll a/b binding protein (CAB) was analysed in more detail. RNA from different tissues and from different developmental stages were used in RNA blot experiments. RNA was isolated from different organs of sugar beets from a field 4, 6, 10, 12, 16 and 19 weeks after sowing. This interval covers the lifetime of a sugar beet in central Europe. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows that the gene is expressed only in above ground tissue like petiole, sink and source leaf regardless of the developmental stage. Since no expression is observed in below ground tissue like primary and lateral root the promoter of the <italic>cab </italic>gene was isolated and analysed with reporter gene fusions. Compared to the other genes, the expression profile of the gene for SSH fragment L2 showed the strongest tissue specificity during the different time points analysed (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation of two promoters for the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding protein</title><p>For the isolation of a sugar beet promoter corresponding to the <italic>cab </italic>gene, a complete cDNA clone was isolated (GenBank Acc. Nr. AJ579711, see Methods). A homology search with the encoded 252 amino acid long protein reveals a 87% identity to the <italic>cab</italic>11 and 85% identity to the <italic>cab</italic>12 gene from tomato encoding chlorophyll a/b binding protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Prior to the isolation of genomic clones, a gene copy number analysis was performed. DNA from sugar beet genotypes 1K0088 and 4B5421 was digested with different restriction enzymes and hybridized to the L2 fragment (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> shows that in genomic DNA from genotype 1K0088 three (<italic>Eco</italic>RI, <italic>Hin</italic>dIII) and four (<italic>Pst</italic>I) hybridizing fragments are detected, while only one (<italic>Eco</italic>RI) or two (<italic>Pst</italic>I, <italic>Hin</italic>dIII) fragments are detected in genotype 4B5421. From this result it is concluded that genotype 4B5421 harbors one and genotype 1K0088 harbors two copies of the <italic>cab </italic>gene.</p><p>Genomic clones for the two different genes were isolated (Methods). Sequence comparison between the cDNA and both genomic clones indicate a very high degree of sequence identity within the coding region. The CAB11 and CAB12 amino acid sequence differ only in one position (data not shown).</p><p>From both genes the promoter regions were subcloned into plasmid vectors and sequenced (Methods). Sequence of 1148 and 3049 base pairs, respectively, containing most of the upstream region were deposited to GenBank (Acc. Nr. AX449166 and AX449167). The 1148 bp promoter fragment is designated <italic>cab</italic>11 promoter and the 3049 bp fragment <italic>cab</italic>12 promoter. Both fragments harbor 51 base pairs coding region of the CAB protein and 113 (<italic>cab</italic>11) and 70 (<italic>cab</italic>12) base pairs upstream untranslated sequence. Upstream of the untranslated region only about 300 bp are homologous between the two promoters while the rest of the sequence is highly divergent (data not shown). Because the cDNA clone isolated before originates from the genotype 4B5421 and corresponds to the <italic>cab</italic>11 gene, it was investigated if the second gene is also transcribed. Towards these ends 5' RACE amplifications were performed with RNA from genotype 1K0088 and sequenced. This analysis revealed that the <italic>cab</italic>12 gene is also transcribed (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Transient expression assays in sugar beet leaves</title><p>To test whether the isolated promoters confer reporter gene expression in sugar beet leaves, a transient assay was performed. Towards these ends translational fusions of promoter fragments with the luciferase gene from <italic>Photinus pyralis </italic>in the vector pGEM-luc were constructed (see Methods). Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> summarizes the relative gene expression strength obtained with the different promoter reporter gene constructs when transformed into sugar beet leaves. Relative to the CaMV 35S promoter, the strength of all promoter fragments is approximately 20% and no significant drop in gene expression is observed between the largest and smallest promoter fragments. In summary, it can be concluded that the 1097 bp long fragment from the <italic>cab</italic>11 gene and the 342 bp fragment from the <italic>cab</italic>12 gene harbor all <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences required for gene expression in sugar beet leaves at least under the conditions of the transient bioassay.</p></sec><sec><title>The promoter of two chlorophyll a/b binding protein genes confers leaf specific and light inducible gene expression in transgenic sugar beet plants</title><p>To investigate if the <italic>cab</italic>11 and <italic>cab</italic>12 promoters from sugar beet drive reporter gene expression in transgenic plants, promoter reporter gene fusions were introduced via <italic>Agrobacterium </italic>mediated transformation in sugar beet (see Methods). The length of the <italic>cab</italic>11 promoter fragment is 1097 bp and the length of the <italic>cab</italic>12 promoter fragment 2998 bp. Leaves of transgenic lines transferred to the greenhouse were analysed for reporter gene activity. The <italic>cab</italic>11 promoter of 12 independent transformants showed a specific &#x003b2;-glucuronidase (GUS) activity from 9 to 40599 pmol Mu &#x000d7; min<sup>-1 </sup>&#x000d7; mg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). The <italic>cab</italic>12 promoter of 4 transformants showed a specific activity from 223 to 11656 pmol Mu &#x000d7; min<sup>-1 </sup>&#x000d7; mg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). These results indicate that the 1097 bp <italic>cab</italic>11 promoter fragment and the 2998 bp <italic>cab</italic>12 promoter fragment are sufficient to confer promoter activity to transgenic sugar beet leaves. Furthermore, the <italic>cab</italic>11 promoter seems to be stronger than the <italic>cab</italic>12 promoter although more transgenic lines were analysed for <italic>cab</italic>11 than for <italic>cab</italic>12.</p><p>In order to analyse if the <italic>cab</italic>11 and <italic>cab</italic>12 promoters confer tissue specific expression to sugar beet, the roots of three transgenic <italic>cab</italic>11 and three <italic>cab</italic>12 promoter lines were analysed. According to the strength of the <italic>cab</italic>11 and <italic>cab</italic>12 promoters in leaves (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) transgenic lines were selected which show low, moderate or high GUS activity in leaves. None of the lines showed GUS activity in the roots which was above the background level of nontransgenic control plants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Therefore the promoter activity of the <italic>cab</italic>11 and <italic>cab</italic>12 regulatory element is restricted to the above ground tissue of sugar beet and absent in roots. This result is consistent with the observations that transcripts of the <italic>cab </italic>genes are not detectable in the below ground tissue by Northern blot hybridization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><p>To analyse <italic>cab</italic>11 and <italic>cab</italic>12 gene regulation in response to light, the reporter gene activtity of etiolated and green transgenic sugar beets was compared. <italic>In vitro </italic>shoots of the transgenic lines C1-121, C1-122, C2-50 and C2-52 were etiolated for 40 days in the dark. The GUS activity of the etiolated leaflets of one half of the plants was determined. Seven days after illumination the GUS activity of the remaining plants was determined after greening of the leaves. In two independent experiments the <italic>cab</italic>11 and <italic>cab</italic>12 promoter plants showed a 4,3 to 8,3 fold and a 95 to 118 fold induction during greening, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Although the GUS activity of the etiolated plants was comparable in the two assays, the greening plants showed a much stronger reporter gene activity in the second experiment. Apparently, different time points during the differentiation of etioplasts to chloroplasts were analysed. Time after illumination seems to have a strong influence on the level of promoter induction. Furthermore, gene expression is much stronger in these experiments compared to the analysis in transgenic plants (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Finally, these results show that the <italic>cab</italic>11 and <italic>cab</italic>12 promoter are activated during the light induced plastid development.</p></sec><sec><title>The <italic>cab</italic>11 promoter lacks G-box elements with a palindromic ACGT core sequence</title><p>Gene expression is mainly regulated by the binding of transcription factors to specific <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements. Because the two sugar beet promoters show a similar expression profile, it was investigated if there are any differences or similarities in the composition of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences in both promoters. Towards these ends, a database-assisted approach was employed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The Patch&#x02122; program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] was used to inspect both promoter sequences for the occurence of plant transcription factor (TF) binding sites that are annotated to the TRANSFAC<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The results reveal a large number of putative TF binding sites in both promoters (data not shown). Upon closer inspection of the results it was striking that the <italic>cab</italic>11 promoter, in contrast to the <italic>cab</italic>12 promoter was completely void of putative G-box like binding sites that contain a conserved ACGT core sequence and are recognized by bZIP transcription factors. Using the program Patch&#x02122; and entering a lower score boundary of 100% to detect only experimentally verified binding sites, only two putative binding sites for bZIP transcription factors were found in the <italic>cab</italic>11 promoter. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> shows the positions of these two motifs that both lack the ACGT core sequence. The sequence motifs at position -749 and -489 relative to the translation start site were found in the rice glutelin-B1 promoter and are bound by the rice bZIP transcription factor family RISBZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Both sites were also found to be bound by the tobacco bZIP transcription factor TGA1a in a pea lectin promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Inspecting the sequence of the <italic>cab</italic>12 promoter for the ACGT core sequence of bZIP factor binding sites reveals 12 positions for this motif (data not shown). Using the program Patch&#x02122; six experimentally verified binding sites for bZIP factors were detected among these twelve sites that harbor the ACGT core in the <italic>cab</italic>12 promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The motif at position -2104 is also present in the glutathione-S transferase 6 gene promoter of <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>where it is bound by the factor OBF4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The same site and the sites at position -1608 and -1247 occur in the embryonic abundant protein 1 promoter of rice and are recognized by the factors OSBZ8 and TRAB1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The sites at position -1767 and -1599 were recognized as bZIP binding sites in many other systems. The sequence TGACGT is part of the as-1 element of the CaMV 35S promoter that was shown to be bound by tobacco TGA1a, TGA1b, and TGA2.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The site at position -659 is also present in the CaMV 35S promoter where it was shown to be bound by the wheat nuclear factor HBP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The observation that the <italic>cab</italic>11 promoter lacks G-box like elements with a conserved ACGT core sequence indicates that such sites are not required for leaf specific gene expression.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>The chlorophyll a/b binding proteins CAB11 and CAB12 from sugar beet belong to the light harvesting complex I &#x02013; 730 (LHCI-730)</title><p>Subtractive hybridization was used to isolate leaf expressed genes from sugar beet. The goal was the identification of a promoter that drives leaf specific gene expression in transgenic sugar beet plants. Among seven analysed genes a cDNA fragment corresponding to a chlorophyll a/b binding protein gene was shown by RNA gel blot hybridization to be highly specific for green tissue (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Genomic DNA blot hybridizations indicate that the two sugar beet genotypes investigated harbor either one or two copies of the gene designated Bv<italic>cab</italic>11 and Bv<italic>cab</italic>12 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). A complete cDNA for the gene from genotype 4B5421 was isolated and encodes a protein of 252 amino acids that shows the highest homology (87%) to the <italic>cab</italic>11 gene from the light harvesting complex I (LHCI) in tomato [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This and homologies to other LHCI proteins indicate that the sugar beet gene belongs to the type IV LHCI complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Further support for this classification comes from the observation that the intron positions between <italic>cab</italic>11 from tomato and Bv<italic>cab</italic>11 from sugar beet are identical (data not shown).</p><p>LHCI can be subdivided into at least two different chlorophyll-protein complexes, one of which appears to be responsible for the 730 nm fluorescence of PSI (LHCI-730) and the other complex (LHCI-680) fluoresces at lower wavelength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In barley the LHCI-730 complex was isolated as a heterodimer composed of the type I and type IV polypeptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, tomato type I and type IV LHCI polypeptides (Lhca1/<italic>cab</italic>6a and Lhca4/<italic>cab</italic>11) expressed in <italic>E. coli </italic>form a heterodimer <italic>in vitro </italic>that closely resembles the native LHCI-730 dimer from tomato leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Therefore, the sugar beet CAB11 and CAB12 proteins may be part of the LHCI-730 complex.</p></sec><sec><title>G-box like elements are not a prerequisite for leaf specific gene expression</title><p>The promoters for both sugar beet <italic>cab </italic>genes were isolated and linked to reporter genes. Transient gene expression studies in sugar beet indicated that 1097 bp upstream of the ATG from the Bv<italic>cab</italic>11 gene and 342 bp upstream of the ATG from the Bv<italic>cab</italic>12 gene are sufficient for leaf specific gene expression in sugar beet (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p><p>Promoter reporter gene constructs for Bv<italic>cab</italic>11 and Bv<italic>cab</italic>12 were stably transformed into sugar beet (<italic>Beta vulgaris</italic>, var. VRB). In sugar beet both promoters are expressed in leaves (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><p>When the promoter sequences of both <italic>cab </italic>genes where analysed for putative transcription factor binding sites, a striking difference was observed. The Bv<italic>cab</italic>11 promoter lacks G-box like sequences with a palindromic ACGT core. Are G-boxes required for light or leaf specific gene expression? A 268 bp fragment of the wheat <italic>cab</italic>-1 promoter functions as a light responsive and organ specific enhancer in transgenic tobacco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Most notably the three regions that interact with nuclear factors and that were able to enhance gene expression of a 90 bp CaMV 35S minimal promoter did not contain a G-box sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The requirement of G-box sequences for light specific gene expression has also been analysed directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. A trimer of the G-box motif found in the spinach ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit-1 promoter was fused to a 90 bp CaMV 35S minimal promoter. While a mutant of this G-box did not confer gene expression to the minimal promoter in the dark and under different light conditions, the G-box increased reporter gene expression under these conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Reporter gene expression in the dark was comparably higher than under different light conditions. This is similar to the finding that a G-box like sequence in the <italic>cab</italic>1R gene of rice is necessary for high level transient expression of a reporter gene in tobacco leaf tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Taken together, this indicates that the presence of G-box sequences may have a quantitative effect but may not be a prerequisite for green tissue specific gene expression in sugar beet.</p></sec><sec><title>Biotechnological applications of leaf specific promoters in sugar beet</title><p>The major goal of this work was the isolation of a strong leaf specific sugar beet promoter that can be used for biotechnological applications. Disease control is one of the most important goals for biotechnological approaches towards improving sugar beet performance. There are many leaf spot diseases that are detrimental to the plant. For example, <italic>Cercospora </italic>leaf spot is one of the most widespread and destructive foliar diseases of sugar beet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Expressing resistance improving genes in a strong and specific manner against pathogens causing foliar diseases may require a strong leaf specific promoter. With such a promoter, expression in taproots can be avoided which may otherwise take away available energy resources for sugar accumulation.</p><p>The work here shows that two promoters, Bv<italic>cab</italic>11 and Bv<italic>cab</italic>12, have been isolated that drive highly leaf specific gene expression in sugar beet (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). No expression above background levels was detected for both promoters in sugar beet roots (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>).</p><p>Based on the expression strength in transgenic plants, the Bv<italic>cab</italic>11 promoter may be suitable for biotechnological applications because it achieves a reporter gene activity comparable to the strong CaMV 35S promoter. CaMV 35S-mediated GUS activities in transgenic tobacco plants were reported as 113000 U (average of 10 plants, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]) and 9000 U (average of 15 plants, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]) in which 1 Unit refers to pmol 4-Mu produced min<sup>-1 </sup>&#x000d7; mg protein<sup>-1 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>The highest level of <italic>cab</italic>11 derived GUS expression is 40599 pmol Mu x min<sup>-1 </sup>&#x000d7; mg<sup>-1 </sup>which is comparable with the expression strength of the strong CaMV 35S promoter in tobacco.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, this work presents the isolation and expression analysis of two <italic>cab </italic>promoters from sugar beet. Particularly, the Bv<italic>cab</italic>11 promoter may be useful to drive strong and specific gene expression in transgenic host plants. The lack of bZIP binding sites harboring the ACGT core sequence could also be advantageous for transient analysis of bZIP transcription factors when using a Bv<italic>cab</italic>11 reporter gene construct as a transformation control.
