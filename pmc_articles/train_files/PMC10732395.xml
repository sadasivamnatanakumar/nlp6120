Adult studies have estimated infection timing using rates of HIV RNA diversification, however, it is unknown whether adult-trained models can provide accurate predictions when used for infants due to possible differences in viral dynamics. While rates of viral diversification have been well defined for adults, there are limited data characterizing these dynamics for infants. Here, we performed Illumina sequencing of <italic toggle="yes">gag</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">pol</italic> using longitudinal plasma samples from 22 Kenyan infants with well-characterized infection timing. We used these data to characterize viral diversity changes over time by designing an infant-trained Bayesian hierarchical regression model that predicts time since infection using viral diversity. We show that diversity accumulates with time for most infants (median rate within <italic toggle="yes">pol</italic> = 0.00079 diversity/month), and diversity accumulates much faster than in adults (compare previously-reported adult rate within <italic toggle="yes">pol</italic> = 0.00024 diversity/month [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]). We find that the infant rate of viral diversification varies by individual, gene region, and relative timing of infection, but not by set-point viral load or rate of CD4+ T cell decline. We compare the predictive performance of this infant-trained Bayesian hierarchical regression model with simple linear regression models trained using the same infant data, as well as existing adult-trained models [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Using an independent dataset from an additional 15 infants with frequent HIV testing to define infection timing, we demonstrate that infant-trained models more accurately estimate time since infection than existing adult-trained models. This work will be useful for timing HIV acquisition for infants with unknown infection timing and for refining our understanding of how viral diversity accumulates in infants, both of which may have broad implications for the future development of infant-specific therapeutic and preventive interventions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Knowledge of the timing of HIV infection is crucial for improving our understanding of viral transmission and pathogenesis, especially in infants. In this group, viral load levels have been found to be much higher than in adults and vary based on age and mode of infection. In this study, we explore viral diversity dynamics during the early stages of pediatric HIV infection. Inspired by previous studies in adults, we develop infant-specific models that measure rates of viral diversification and use these inferred rates to estimate infection timing. Applying these models to a cohort of Kenyan infants, we successfully estimate their infection timing more accurately than existing adult-specific models. We also show that viral diversity accumulates much faster in infants compared to adults. This work provides new insights into how the HIV sequence diversifies in infants, offering valuable information for understanding differences in viral pathogenesis, transmission, and disease progression between infants and adults. These findings also highlight the importance of considering these differences when developing methodologies for future studies related to HIV infection timing across different age groups, as failing to do so may result in incorrect conclusions regarding the timing of pediatric infections.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

Previous work has shown that viral load and pathogenesis vary based on age and mode of infection [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Specifically, infants infected prior to two months of age have substantially higher HIV RNA levels compared to later-infected infants and adults [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, outside of these closely monitored cohorts, most newly-diagnosed infants with HIV have had an established HIV infection for an unknown duration. Defining the time of infection typically requires regular infant testing which is not always implemented. Knowledge of the timing of HIV acquisition is important for improving our understanding of viral transmission and pathogenesis in infants.</p><p>Adult studies have established that HIV sequence diversity increases over time [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Infections typically start with infection of just one or a few variants due to a bottleneck during HIV transmission that results in a relatively homogeneous viral population during the early stages of acute HIV infection [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], a concept that was first described for infants [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The error-prone nature of the reverse transcriptase enzyme and pressure from the host immune response causes the viral population to diversify rapidly over time [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. During early infection, viral diversity has been shown to increase in an approximately linear fashion [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This trend has been observed using various sequencing platforms and measures of sequence diversity including the fraction of polymorphic nucleotides [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], high-resolution melting [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and average pairwise diversity [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Of these measures, average pairwise diversity, which is the probability that any two sequences will have different nucleotides at a specified position, averaged over all positions in the sequence, is arguably the most interpretable and easy to calculate. In fact, adult studies have shown that linear regression models using average pairwise diversity can be used to accurately estimate infection timing [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to adults, rates of viral diversification in infants are not well understood, despite extensive efforts to characterize other differences between infant and adult HIV infections. For example, HIV set-point viral load levels have been found to be substantially higher for infants compared to adults [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Because infants are infected in the presence of maternal antibodies, viruses may escape immune pressure prior to infection [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and, thus, possess relatively higher replicative fitness [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Further, compared to acutely-infected adults, infants are slower to suppress virus [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] which may be related to the fact that infants possess a developing immune system at the time of infection. Because of these many differences, rates of viral diversification in infants likely differ from adults [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It is unknown whether viral diversity in infants increases in an approximately linear fashion during early infection and whether it can be used to estimate pediatric infection timing.</p><p>In this paper, we investigate how viral average pairwise diversity (APD) changes with time in a cohort of Kenyan infants, and explore whether rates of viral diversification can be used to accurately estimate infection timing. We designed a Bayesian hierarchical regression model to measure rates of viral diversification and trained this model using sequence data collected at 2&#x02013;3 timepoints post HIV acquisition from 22 infants with well characterized timing of HIV infection. With this infant-trained model, we show that sequence diversity accumulates with time for most infants and that the rate of this accumulation varies by individual, gene-region, and mode of infection, but not by set-point viral load or rate of CD4+ T cell decline. We demonstrate that this model has well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, meaning that it delivers accurate confidence intervals. Further, we compared the ability of this infant-trained Bayesian hierarchical regression model to estimate pediatric infection timing with simple linear regression models trained using the same infant data, as well as existing adult-trained models [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. We show that both infant-trained model types can more accurately estimate infant time since infection than the existing adult-trained models, although both have non-trivial levels of prediction error.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Data overview</title><p>Kenyan children born to mothers living with HIV that were enrolled in cohort studies between 1992&#x02013;2002 (see <xref rid="sec010" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>) were followed from birth through age two with frequent HIV testing and banked plasma sampling [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Because antiretroviral therapy (ART) was not yet standard of care in Kenya during the time frame, the children were all ART-naive for the duration of monitoring, however, several of their mothers received a short course of ART during pregnancy. Frequent HIV testing (every 6&#x02013;12 weeks) allowed us to estimate the time of HIV infection as the midpoint between the last negative test and the first positive test. We take this estimated time of HIV infection as the &#x0201c;true&#x0201d; infection time. For each infant, we used Illumina sequencing to calculate average pairwise viral diversity measures within 3 different regions across <italic toggle="yes">gag</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">pol</italic> from plasma HIV RNA (see <xref rid="sec010" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>).</p><p>The model training data set consisted of sequences from 22 infants that had plasma samples available from 2&#x02013;3 timepoints following HIV acquisition. Of these 22 infants, 11 were infected in-utero (log10 set-point viral load ranging from 5.72&#x02013;6.52) and 11 were infected postpartum (log10 set-point viral load ranging from 5.29&#x02013;7.80). The model testing data set consisted of sequence data from only a single time point following HIV acquisition from 15 additional infants, of which 2 and 13 were infected in-utero or postpartum, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Overview of modeling approach to quantify rates of viral sequence diversification in infants</title><p>As described above, the training data set contains viral sequence diversity (APD) measures sampled from multiple time points and gene regions for each individual (<xref rid="ppat.1011861.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Because of the multi-dimensional nature of these data, we chose to quantify rates of viral diversification using a Bayesian hierarchical model which affords us the flexibility of measuring the relationship between viral diversity and time across all individuals and gene regions simultaneously using a single, unified model. To do so, we model the relationship between time since infection and viral sequence diversity linearly, using all of the data from all individuals and gene regions, with a baseline slope term. Within this same model, we also include individual-specific and gene-region-specific slope-modifying terms to account for differences in slope for each individual and gene region relative to the baseline slope (<xref rid="ppat.1011861.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>).

The Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework used for this model allows us to obtain a distribution of estimated times since infection given a viral sequence diversity measure (APD) using a distribution of APD slopes which is obtained from a distribution of baseline slopes in addition to individual-specific and gene-region-specific slope-modifying terms. Together, these distributions of APD slopes provide an estimate of the rates of viral sequence diversification for each individual and gene region. These APD slopes will have units months/diversity which correspond to our predictive set-up.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.1011861.g001" position="float"/></fig><p>We designed this model such that it could use APD measures to predict time since infection for infants. As such, the inferred rates of viral diversification, or APD slopes, from this model will have units months/diversity which correspond to our predictive set-up. A similar approach was taken in a previous study estimating rates of viral diversification in an adult cohort [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. For this reason, analysis and plots after <xref rid="ppat.1011861.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref> will have pairwise diversity on the x axis, and time on the y axis.</p><p>The Bayesian modeling framework allowed us to incorporate existing biological knowledge when formulating the model. Because it has been shown that the majority of infants are infected with only a single viral variant [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], we restricted the baseline slope term to be a positive value in the model formulation using a prior, or an initial set of plausible values. However, because some individuals and gene-regions may accumulate viral diversity differently, we did not restrict the sign of the individual-specific and gene-region-specific slope-modifying terms. As such, it is still possible for the APD slope (i.e. the sum of the baseline slope, individual-specific slope-modifying term, and the gene-region-specific slope-modifying term) to be negative in value, which would suggest that diversity decreases with time for a given individual and gene region. Further, because we assumed that sequence diversity should be zero at infection time, we did not infer an intercept parameter.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Viral diversity increases with time for all individuals and gene regions</title><p>Each viral sequence diversity (APD) measure represents the probability that two randomly drawn sequences have different nucleotides at a specified position, averaged over all positions, and the APD slope (i.e. rate of APD accumulation measured in units of months per diversity) represents the rate at which the APD measure increases. Because mutations will saturate within a sequence over time, APD slope should not be interpreted as the time required for all sites between two sequences to be mismatched. Instead, we suggest considering the inverse of APD slope, measured in units of diversity per month, which can be interpreted as the rate at which mismatches between two sequences accumulate. We estimated full posterior distributions of APD slopes from a sum of the baseline slope, individual-specific slope-modifying terms, and gene-region-specific slope-modifying terms using Hamiltonian Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling from the <italic toggle="yes">infant-trained hierarchical model</italic>, given the full infant training data set (see <xref rid="sec010" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). These APD slope distributions are characterized by different medians and credible intervals (the Bayesian analogue of a confidence interval) for each individual and gene region. All median APD slopes were positive and only one credible interval contained negative values, suggesting that sequence diversity increases with time for all individuals and gene regions (<xref rid="ppat.1011861.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). Overall, the inferred baseline slope suggested a positive rate of APD accumulation (median APD slope = 1262.16 months/diversity, 89% credible interval = [900.60, 1606.44]).</p><p>To assess the adequacy of the <italic toggle="yes">infant-trained hierarchical model</italic> for measuring APD slope, we did a series of posterior predictive checks which involve comparing the observed time since infection data to simulated samples generated from the posterior predictive distribution. This posterior predictive distribution is the model-derived distribution of possible times since infection for new observations given the observed data. Ideally, if the model fits the data well, then replicated time since infection data generated under the model should look similar to the observed time since infection data. Indeed, this is mostly what we observe (<xref rid="ppat.1011861.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). However, these replicated data contained a wider range of time since infection values suggesting that the model allows for more variation in APD slope and possible time since infection than expected, given the observed data.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Rates of viral sequence diversification vary by individual, gene region, and mode of infection, but not by set-point viral load or rate of CD4+ T cell decline</title><p>We were interested in whether rates of viral sequence diversification (i.e. APD slope) varied significantly by individual, gene region, mode of infection, set-point viral load, or rate of CD4+ T cell decline.

Within the Bayesian framework, Bayes factors provide a method for comparing two models and measuring the weight of evidence in favor of one model relative to the other.

As such, both large and small Bayes factors (BFs) contain useful information.</p><p>With these methods, we separately compared the hypotheses that APD slopes vary by gene region or individual against the alternative hypotheses that the rates do not vary. In both cases, we found extremely strong evidence in favor of the <italic toggle="yes">infant-trained hierarchical model</italic>, suggesting that APD slopes varied both across individuals (BF = 6.710 &#x000d7; 10<sup>20</sup>) and gene regions (BF = 3.963 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup>). These trends were reflected when looking closer at the data (<xref rid="ppat.1011861.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>) and the inferred values of the individual-specific and gene-region-specific slope-modifying terms from the <italic toggle="yes">infant-trained hierarchical model</italic> (Figs <xref rid="ppat.1011861.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="ppat.1011861.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). The inferred individual-specific slope-modifying terms, which model the differences in APD slope for each individual relative to the baseline slope, suggested that APD slopes vary substantially across individuals (range of median slope difference [89% credible interval] = -873.48 [-1247.16, -518.64] to 934.08 [445.32, 1451.16] months/diversity).

For this comparison, we found extremely strong evidence in favor of the alternative model suggesting that APD slope varied by mode of infection (BF = 1.199 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>). Specifically, the mode-of-infection-specific slope-modifying term, which models the difference in APD slope between modes of infection relative to the baseline slope, suggested that individuals infected after birth had a higher rate of APD accumulation (median slope difference = -88.44 months/diversity, 89% credible interval = [-541.20, 253.08]) compared to individuals infected in-utero (median slope difference = 116.76 months/diversity, 89% credible interval = [-146.4, 674.88]). These differences can be seen visually in <xref rid="ppat.1011861.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>. A reviewer suggested that this signal was driven by the two postpartum-infected individuals (individuals 12 and 13) who had relatively higher rates of viral diversification compared to the other postpartum-infected individuals. Indeed, we found that APD slope did not vary substantially with mode of infection (BF = 2.203) when these two individuals were excluded from the analysis. Regardless of whether the variation in APD slopes by mode of infection represents a true biological signal, we chose not to use the alternative model that includes a mode-of-infection-specific slope-modifying term for downstream analyses. This decision was made because we do not expect to have knowledge of the mode of infection when applying our final model to individuals with unknown infection timing.</p><p>Lastly, because set-point viral load and rate of CD4+ T cell decline are both strong predictors of disease progression and survival [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], we were interested in whether APD slopes varied in the context of these variables.

Likewise, we expected that individuals with higher rates of CD4+ T cell decline (i.e. faster disease progression) would also have higher rates of viral diversification. To explore this, we compared APD slope to set-point viral load (<xref rid="ppat.1011861.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>) and to rate of CD4+ T cell decline (<xref rid="ppat.1011861.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>).

Using Illumina sequencing of <italic toggle="yes">gag</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">pol</italic> from longitudinal plasma samples from a cohort of Kenyan infants with well-defined infection timing, we have (1) quantified viral diversity dynamics during the early stages of pediatric HIV infection and (2) demonstrated that infant time since infection can be estimated using <underline>infant-specific</underline> rates of viral diversification, but not adult-specific rates.</p><p>Given that infants are often slower to suppress virus [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], infected with viruses possessing relatively higher replicative fitness [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and have higher HIV set-point viral load levels [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] compared to adults, it has been previously suggested that rates of viral diversification likely differ between the two groups [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Indeed, a previous adult study reported that viral diversity increases at a rate of 0.00024 diversity/month (adult model slope of 4206.0 months/diversity) using sequences sampled from the <italic toggle="yes">pol</italic> gene within an adult cohort [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

This finding suggests that viral diversity accumulates much faster during pediatric infection relative to adult infection and highlights the importance of considering these differences when developing methodologies for future studies related to HIV infection timing across different age groups. Depending on the study, failure to appropriately account for accelerated rates of HIV sequence evolution in infants could result in erroneous conclusions regarding the timing and/or source of pediatric infections.</p><p>Further, we found that these infant viral diversity dynamics varied by gene region such that viral diversity accumulated faster within <italic toggle="yes">gag</italic> compared to <italic toggle="yes">pol</italic>.

We also reported that rates of viral diversification varied substantially across individual infants which may be related to both host and viral factors. It is possible that individuals infected with more than one viral variant could experience a decrease in viral diversity during the early stages of infection as a result of selection effects, however, infant infections are most often initiated by a single viral variant [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

This signal appeared to be driven by two postpartum-infected individuals (individuals 12 and 13) who had relatively higher rates of viral diversification compared to the other postpartum-infected individuals. In fact, when we removed these individuals from our analysis, we no longer found a difference in viral diversification rates between the two groups. We do not rule out that these are instead cases of very late in utero infections, which may not test positive at birth. Regardless, this result is surprising given that in-utero-infected individuals have been previously shown to have relatively higher HIV set-point viral load levels and faster disease progression compared to individuals infected after birth [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We expected that individuals with higher set-point viral load levels and higher rates of CD4+ T cell decline, and thus higher rates of viral replication and faster disease progression, would have higher rates of viral diversification. However, we found that rates of viral diversification did not vary substantially with set-point viral load levels or rate of CD4+ T cell decline. It is possible that the limited number of samples included in this analysis may have restricted our ability to detect a signal. Because this analysis included a limited range of set-point viral load levels and rates of CD4+ T cell decline across the individuals in this study, further work will be required to explore the relationship between viral diversification rates and set-point viral load levels/rate of CD4+ T cell decline in infants.</p><p>Adult studies have shown that linear regression models using viral diversity can be used to estimate adult infection timing [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; These adult-specific models report mean prediction errors ranging from 10.08&#x02013;12 months [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] across independent adult cohorts. Here, we explored the potential for using this approach to estimate infection timing in infants. We found that infant time since infection can be estimated more accurately using infant-trained models compared to previously-developed adult-trained models [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Specifically, we found that infant-trained linear regression models, which were trained using similar methods to the previously-developed adult-trained models, led to the most accurate estimates across two independent infant data sets. An infant-trained Bayesian hierarchical regression model which accounted for individual- and gene-region-specific variations in viral diversification rates had similar performance. The large differences in viral diversification rates between infants and adults described above likely explain why infant-trained models lead to more accurate estimates of infant infection timing compared to adult-trained models. Despite this increased accuracy, we still found a lack of precision across our best infant-trained models (prediction error from all gene region 3 (3&#x02019; end of <italic toggle="yes">pol</italic>) APD measures with the <italic toggle="yes">infant-trained linear model</italic> range = 0&#x02013;19.8 months, mean = 5.6 months) which underlines the uncertainty that is inherent to predicting infection timing using diversity measures.</p><p>For both infant-trained model types, viral diversity sampled from within the <italic toggle="yes">pol</italic> gene led to the most accurate infection timing estimates compared to <italic toggle="yes">gag</italic>. This suggests that viral diversity may accumulate more linearly within <italic toggle="yes">pol</italic> compared to <italic toggle="yes">gag</italic> during the early stages of infant infection. This finding is consistent with previous studies of viral diversity accumulation during adult infection [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, for both infant-trained models, we reported that prediction error depended on the true time since infection such that true time since infection values less than ~12 months were overestimated by each model and true time since infection values greater than ~12 months were underestimated by each model. We noted even more extreme results when validating each infant-trained model using the infant testing dataset which contained data from infants whose true time since infection values were relatively larger compared to the training dataset. These trends suggest that viral diversity may not accumulate in a perfectly linear fashion during the early stages of pediatric infection. Instead, it appears that viral diversity may accumulate faster during the first year of infection relative to the second year of infection. This may be possible if, for example, rapidly increasing viral load levels during very early infection result in relatively higher rates of viral replication/diversification, perhaps as a result of viral adaptation to a new human host, compared to when set-point viral load levels are established later on. Given that infants are infected in the presence of maternal antibodies, another possible explanation is that pressure from maternal passive antibodies may lead to an increase in viral replication/diversification during the early stages of infection relative to later stages. Further work consisting of more frequent diversity sampling during early infection will be required to explore these relationships and formulate appropriate regression models (i.e. nonlinear models, models responsive to viral population size, etc.).</p><p>Here we developed and evaluated methods for estimating infection timing that are suitable for short, unlinked sequencing reads, a data type used in some adult-specific models [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Other types of sequencing data enable additional infection timing methodologies. For example, given single genome sequence data, one can use BEAST, a Bayesian phylogenetic software, to conduct a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis for molecular dating. This approach has been previously shown to accurately estimate infection timing of adult HIV infections [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>There are several key limitations of our study. First, because we were interested in quantifying viral diversity dynamics during pediatric HIV infection prior to antiretroviral therapy, our study relied on the availability of banked plasma samples from infants who were diagnosed with HIV before antiretroviral therapy was standard of care (e.g. infants diagnosed in Kenya between 1992&#x02013;2002) whose infection timing was well-defined. Next, while all of the infants included in this study were naive to antiretroviral therapy for the duration of their monitoring, many of their mothers received a short course of zidovudine (AZT) during pregnancy, which was standard of care in Kenya at the time of cohort enrollment to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission. In fact, for the infants included in the training cohort, only 3 out of 22 mothers did not receive short-course AZT during their pregnancies. While it is possible that this lack of treatment could have influenced the rates of viral diversification for the infants born to these mothers, we did not have the statistical power to explore this relationship due to the small number without AZT. Also, we noted several differences in properties between the training and testing data sets which may explain the differences in prediction errors between the two data sets when using each model. For example, the three testing data set observations with the largest over-prediction errors from all of the infant-trained models each had gene region 1 (within <italic toggle="yes">gag</italic>) APD measures that were greater than 0.04 and times since infection that were greater than 15.6 months. Observations with similar gene region 1 APD measures and times since infection appeared at very low frequencies within the training data set. Next, because our infection timing models were formulated using the assumption that the majority of infants are infected with only a single viral variant [<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1011861.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], they may produce inaccurate time since infection estimates for individuals with multi-founder infections. Lastly, since the infection timing for each individual was defined using HIV testing intervals between 6&#x02013;12 weeks, the known infection time of each individual contains errors that limited the accuracy of our infection time modeling.</p><p>In summary, we have found that viral diversity increases over time during the first two years of pediatric infection and that infant-specific rates of viral diversification can be used to estimate pediatric infection timing. These results further our understanding of pediatric HIV pathogenesis and how it may differ from adult infection, particularly in regards to differences in rates of HIV sequence diversification.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The CTL and NBT sub-studies described here were approved by the Kenyatta National Hospital&#x02013;University of Nairobi Ethics and Research Committee, the Fred Hutch Cancer Center Institutional Review Board, and the University of Washington Institutional Review Board.

To more precisely estimate time of infection, samples prior to the first HIV-DNA-positive test were tested for HIV RNA. Time of infection was estimated as the midpoint between the last negative HIV DNA or RNA test and the first positive test. Twenty-two infants had multiple timepoints available and were included in the training data set, of which 11 were HIV-positive at birth and 11 were HIV-negative at birth and subsequently tested HIV-infected after 3 months of followup.

The estimated infection time measures were used in the models as described below. For individuals infected in-utero, time of infection was estimated as birth since HIV testing could not be conducted prior to delivery (i.e. in-utero).

Like the previously-published <italic toggle="yes">adult-trained linear models</italic>, we used least absolute deviation regression to train an infant model for each gene region separately. We refer to these models as the <italic toggle="yes">infant-trained linear models</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Model validation</title><p>For each infant-trained model (e.g. the <italic toggle="yes">infant-trained linear models</italic> and the <italic toggle="yes">infant-trained hierarchical model)</italic>, we used leave-one-out-cross-validation to estimate time since infection for each individual and APD measure within the infant training data set. To do this, we removed all data for each individual from the data set (as opposed to data from one sampled time point for each individual), re-fit the model, and estimated time since infection for the held-out individual. We repeated this procedure for all individuals in the training data set. We measured prediction accuracy by comparing these model-derived time since infection estimates to the HIV-testing-derived true time since infection measures for each individual. We compared the accuracy of these predictions to those from the <italic toggle="yes">adult-trained linear models</italic>.</p><p>Further, we defined an independent testing data set containing single-time-point viral APD measures from 15 additional infants (described above). Data from these infants was not present in the original training data set. Before analyzing these data, we &#x0201c;froze&#x0201d; our trained model coefficients (for the <italic toggle="yes">infant-trained linear models</italic>) and posterior distributions over model parameters (for the <italic toggle="yes">infant-trained hierarchical model</italic>) in git commit 43f312c on our repository. We then inferred the time since infection for each of the 15 testing data set infants using these frozen regression coefficients for each infant-trained model (i.e. <italic toggle="yes">infant-trained hierarchical model</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">infant-trained linear models)</italic>. As before, we compared the accuracy of these predictions to those from the <italic toggle="yes">adult-trained linear models</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec023" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="ppat.1011861.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>APD increases with time for most individuals and gene regions.</title><p>The inferred distribution of APD slope for each individual and gene region in the training data set obtained using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling from the Bayesian hierarchical model (described above) is shown.

</p><p>***********************</p><p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p><p>
<bold>Part I - Summary</bold>
</p><p>Please use this section to discuss strengths/weaknesses of study, novelty/significance, general execution and scholarship.</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#x000a0;Russell and co-authors introduce a Bayesian hierarchical model for estimating timing of infection in infants. They show that training their model on the diversity of viral sequences sampled in utero and postpartum more accurately predicts infection timing than training on sequences sampled from adults (or linear modeling trained on infant sequences). Using this method, they find considerable inter-individual and gene region variation, but overall that pol diversifies faster in infants than adults, irrespective of SPVL or CD4+ decline. The authors have done well to develop a method that takes advantage of their unique dataset and the results are promising for its further use. I have a few outstanding questions regarding how the method was tested and how it will be more widely implemented. -Eric Lewitus</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;In their manuscript, &#x02018;Using viral sequence diversity to estimate time of HIV infection in infants&#x02019;, estimated rates of viral diversification in 22 Kenyan children and determined that this rate was three times higher than what is seen in infected adults. In this population the diversification rate did vary by individual, route of infection (during delivery vs. breast feeding) and by viral gene region analyzed. However, set point viral load or rate of CD4 decline did not seem to be associated with differences in viral diversification rates. The authors used a Bayesian hierarchical model trained on either the infant data or existing adult data to determine the best fit to the data from the validation cohort of 15 different infants. They found that the model trained with the data from the Kenyan infants fit the validation model best. Unfortunately, there is too much subject-to-subject variability to differentiate infants who were infected in-utero vs. after birth. Overall, this is a well written and thorough investigation. The figures and tables are clear and appropriate. There are some issues to address.</p><p>**********</p><p>
<bold>Part II &#x02013; Major Issues: Key Experiments Required for Acceptance</bold>
</p><p>Please use this section to detail the key new experiments or modifications of existing experiments that should be <underline>absolutely</underline> required to validate study conclusions.</p><p>Generally, there should be no more than 3 such required experiments or major modifications for a "Major Revision" recommendation. If more than 3 experiments are necessary to validate the study conclusions, then you are encouraged to recommend "Reject".</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#x000a0;The state-of-the-art for inferring timing of infection is phylogenetic molecular dating. I think the utility of the authors&#x02019; method would need to be shown to be superior in ease of implementation and at leats comparable in results to, for example, inferences of timing of infection drawn from BEAST analyses. A comparison to Dearlove et al., PLoS Comp Bio, 2021 (or another relevant analysis) would suffice. If Bayesian phylogenetic analysis for molecular dating is not appropriate for their question (or infant sequences), then it would be helpful for the authors to explain why.</p><p>Timing of infection is inferred in years. Given that the individuals are infants, which gives a small window for timing of infection, and that MAE is around 0.5 years, is this enough resolution? What questions regarding timing of infection do the authors imagine would be answered at this resolution? As results are given in fractions of years (e.g., 1.68), it would be useful to report results in months. Otherwise, please explain why years were chosen as units.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;(No Response)</p><p>**********</p><p>
<bold>Part III &#x02013; Minor Issues: Editorial and Data Presentation Modifications</bold>
</p><p>Please use this section for editorial suggestions as well as relatively minor modifications of existing data that would enhance clarity.</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#x000a0;Line 145: The studies cited supporting that &#x0201c;the majority of infants are infected with only a single viral variant&#x0201d; are quite limited (3-10 mother-infant pairs) and in one study (Wu et al., 2006) 2/8 infant infections appear to have been established by multiple founder variants, which is on par with adults. As deep sequencing is showing that rare founder variants are more common than previously thought, how would this affect inference with the Bayesian hierarchical model. Can it be adapted to infer timing in multi-founder infections? If not, I think it is worth saying that the method is only application to infections established with a single variant.</p><p>Line 157: Considering that certain sites will always be conserved, wouldn&#x02019;t it make more sense to compute the APD backwards in time to when diversity was zero? A results of 105 years &#x02014; which if I understand correctly means that it would take 105 years for all sites between two sequences to be mismatched &#x02014; is difficult to conceptualize. Perhaps the authors could explain further why they chose to look at the rate of diversity accumulation forwards in time.</p><p>Lines 225-237: If the authors &#x0201c;did not use this alternative model for downstream analyses&#x0201d;, why was it presented? Could the authors explain what this alternative model brings to the manuscript?</p><p>Lines 427-429: If individuals 12 and 13 did not test positive at birth, why would they have elevated rates compared to individuals infected in utero and test positive at birth? Does the difference between in utero and postpartum rates disappear if these individuals are removed?</p><p>Lines 466-477: Could the model instead be fit with a non-linear model? Or something responsive to Ne?</p><p>Line 481: Were there any differences in mothers who received ART during pregancy?</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;1) The last sentence of the introduction, on line 61, the authors state that, &#x0201c;These findings hold promise for developing infant-specific treatment approaches and preventive measures.&#x0201d; What are the possible treatment procedures and prevention measures that would use the findings presented in the manuscript? This should be addressed in in the discussion.</p><p>2) On line 481, the authors state that some of the mothers were on ART at the time of birth. Why was exposure not added to the model to see if it mattered?</p><p>3) Line 425 states, &#x0201c;In fact, we found that only one individual (individual 485) had a decrease in viral diversity over time across all gene regions.&#x0201d; However, only individuals numbered 1 to 21 are presented. Based on Figure 1 panel A, I believe the authors are referring to individual #7.</p><p>4) It is surprising that the rates of diversification for HIV are three-fold faster in infants than in adults. This is especially true given the infants undeveloped immune system at the time of infection. In adults whose immune systems are severely compromised (like end stage AIDS), the rates of diversification are less than when their immune system is intact (see Shankarappa J Virol 1999 for example). These individuals also have very high viral loads, similar to that seen in infants. Adaptation to a new a new host could be the reason for the increased viral evolution that is observed. This would be supported by the author&#x02019;s observation that the rate of diversification decreases after the first year.</p><p>5) How would the impact of accelerated HIV sequence evolution in infants impact other studies? For example, the outbreak in children attending the Al-Fateh Hospital in Benghazi, Libya (see de Oliveira Nature 2006), if a different rate of diversification for the infants was used would that implicate the foreign medical staff in infecting the infants?</p><p>**********</p><p>PLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (<ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history" ext-link-type="uri">what does this mean?</ext-link>).
