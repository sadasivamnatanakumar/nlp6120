Two groups of viewers, who viewed either the text-only or multimedia version of the status updates, answered questions about the Facebook users&#x02019; personal characteristics. The viewers&#x02019; perceptions of Facebook users deviated from the users&#x02019; self-perceptions, although user characteristics that serve social motives were more accurately perceived. Multimedia viewers were more accurate than text viewers, whereas the latter showed a greater consensus. Gender and ethnic differences of Facebook users also emerged in online person perceptions, in line with gendered and cultured characteristics. These findings shed critical light on the dynamic interplay between social media users and the cyber audience in the co-construction of a digitally extended self.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

The proliferation of social media and the internet over the past decades has introduced new modes of self-representation and expression. The selfhood comprises not only self-representations in the private mind of the individual but also self-presentations on social media platforms public to the cyber audience [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These self-presentations, achieved through sharing personal experiences and opinions online in text and other media forms (e.g., photo, video, hyperlink), are frequently motivated by the need to connect with others and to express oneself [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. They constitute a digital extension of the selfhood unique to the social media age. Little is known, however, about how social media users&#x02019; self-presentations through online posts are viewed by other social media users, or the cyber audience. Understanding online person perception is critical to facilitate effective communication and interpersonal relationships [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The present study set out to examine to what extent the personal characteristics of social media users in the eyes of the cyber audience via meaning making of online posts reflect the users&#x02019; views of themselves.</p><sec id="sec002"><title>Characteristics of self-presentation in online posts</title><p>Posting personal experiences and opinions on social media is a ubiquitous daily activity for many. With the unlimited audience and the permanent storage for the shared information in cyber space, this activity has become an important means for individuals to achieve social bonding and personal expression [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Accordingly, social media users often, intentionally or subconsciously, create online posts with content and form in service of their personal and social motives. Research has shown that social media users tend to be open and disclosive in their posts, revealing intimate personal details and innermost thoughts and feelings, and that online self-disclosure is associated with extraversion and disclosiveness traits [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Social media users also frequently use tactics such as directly asking questions or seeking feedback to encourage immediate interaction from the cyber audience, which creates a sense of connectedness with the audience [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Furthermore, social media users often selectively post positive experiences online to glorify themselves and create an ideal self-image [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition, when writing posts, social media users tend to craft their stories to highlight captivating aspects of their experiences and portray a unique persona with maximized individuality and relational orientation [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Thus, to achieve self-expression and social connection, the self as presented through social media posts may be characterized by heightened extraversion, disclosiveness, sense of connectedness, self-esteem, independence, and interdependence [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Indeed, posts with these characteristics have been shown to have positive consequences for the social media users&#x02019; social network and psychological well-being [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The lack of these characteristics, in contrast, tends to be associated with negative influences of social media use [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Furthermore, the functional capabilities of social media platforms provide rich technology features in multimedia forms beyond simple text, such as photo, animation, video, hyperlink, and even livestreaming and augmented reality. The multimedia features are expected to be effective means for individuals to present their personal characteristics in social media posts that best serve their goals to communicate the self and to relate to other selves online [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Importantly, from a cognitive perspective, individuals form a sense of self and personality through a constructive process of meaning-making of their lived experiences [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. By interpreting, evaluating, and making sense of their day-to-day encounters (e.g., receiving an A+ in a difficult exam), individuals construct coherent stories of who they are, their values and beliefs, and their unique personal characteristics (i.e., I&#x02019;m a smart, hard-working person who is aiming towards a successful career). This meaning-making process may take place in the private space&#x02014;within the person&#x02014;when one reflects on life events, or in the shared space&#x02014;between persons&#x02014;when one tells elaborate personal stories to others. During the self-presentation in online posts, however, the meaning-making process is no longer just located &#x0201c;within&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;between,&#x0201d; but externalized: It is outsourced to the cyber audience [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>The role of the cyber audience</title><p>Does the cyber audience perceive the personal characteristics of the social media users based on the users&#x02019; self-presentation in online posts? Prior research on personality perception based on personal websites (e.g., blogs) or online profiles has shown that observers generally have high levels of accuracy and consensus in their impressions of social media users [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, unlike personal blogs or profiles in which social media users explicitly convey who they are, online posts such as Facebook status updates lack a coherent framework about the author. Other than being chronologically ordered and having the author as the main character, social media posts are typically isolated episodes and states of mind that the author experiences, with the earlier posts bearing no obvious logical connections with the later ones. Also, social media posts are often casually generated brief messages with little contemplation [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], where the author may hardly engage in meaning making about themselves. Thus, to work out who the author is, the cyber audience needs to make sense of the disparate experiences shared in the social media posts and interweave the slices of information into a coherent representation about the author [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In other words, the meaning-making process is outsourced to the cyber audience, who encodes, integrates, and updates information from social media posts about the characteristics, roles, and experiences of the author [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This constructive meaning-making process may be further shared among the cyber audience members and function through the transactive mind of the virtual community, or the &#x0201c;cybermind&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. <xref rid="pone.0294990.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> illustrates our theoretical model.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0294990.g001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0294990.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Self-presentation and outsourced meaning-making on social media.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0294990.g001" position="float"/></fig><p>Interestingly, social media posts with some of those characteristics described above (e.g., disclosiveness, self-esteem, sense of connectedness) tend to engage a larger and more responsive cyber audience who provides comments, feedback, and likes to the posts [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The responsiveness of the cyber audience, in turn, encourages more frequent and more open sharing of such posts on social media [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Thus, it appears that the cyber audience may be able to infer and &#x0201c;appreciate&#x0201d; the distinct characteristics&#x02013;at least some of them&#x02014;of the social media users via online posts. Nonetheless, it is unknown how accurate the cyber audience&#x02019;s perceptions of the social media users&#x02019; personal characteristics based on the online posts are in comparison with the users&#x02019; self-views, what factors influence the perceptions, and how consistent the perceptions are among the members of the cyber audience. In addition, although multimedia tools can be utilized by social media users in online posts, it is unclear in the outsourced meaning-making context how they may differentially influence the accuracy and consensus of the cyber audience&#x02019;s perceptions of the social media users&#x02019; persona.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>The present study</title><p>A main goal of the present study is to examine the personal characteristics of social media users as perceived by the cyber audience based on online posts, in comparison with the social media users&#x02019; views of themselves. Different from prior research that has focused on the perception of the Big Five traits from personal blogs and profiles [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], this study focuses on personal characteristics that are often presented via social media posts for social and personal purposes [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Participants provided self-descriptions and completed a battery of measures for their personal characteristics, including extraversion, disclosiveness, connectedness, self-esteem, independence, and interdependence. They then submitted the 20 most recent status updates from their Facebook accounts. Two groups of viewers (i.e., the cyber audience) rated the status updates of the participants (i.e., Facebook users) on the same dimensions of personal characteristics as in the participants&#x02019; self-reports. Given that the cyber audience needs to make sense of the Facebook users&#x02019; status updates to infer the users&#x02019; persona, we hypothesized that discrepancies would occur between the cyber audience&#x02019;s perceptions of the Facebook users&#x02019; characteristics and the users&#x02019; self-views (H1). We further explore whether the discrepancies would vary by characteristics such that the cyber audience might overestimate characteristics that seem easier to infer from the content of the posts (e.g., disclosiveness) [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; while underestimate those that may be less obvious from the posts (e.g., independence, interdependence) (H2).</p><p>A second goal of the study is to examine how social media posts in simple text and those in multimedia forms would differentially influence the cyber audience&#x02019;s meaning making about the social media users&#x02019; persona. The two groups of viewers rated the same Facebook status updates that were either text-only or in multimedia forms (i.e., text plus other media forms).

However, multimedia status updates, with rich information and user interface, might contribute to more diverse interpretations and views among the cyber audience members about the Facebook users&#x02019; persona, when compared with text-only status updates (H4). In other words, multimedia status updates would increase accuracy in viewer perceptions but undermine viewer consensus in the outsourced meaning-making process.</p><p>In addition, a third goal of the present study is to examine whether demographic factors, particularly gender and ethnicity, would influence how the cyber audience perceives the personal characteristics of social media users (H5).

Taking a cognitive meaning-making perspective, the study yielded important findings that shed new light on the dynamic interaction between social media users and the cyber audience in the construction of a digitally extended self.</p><p>As expected, there were substantial discrepancies between how the cyber audience perceived the characteristics of Facebook users based on their status updates and the users&#x02019; self-reported personal characteristics (H1). Correlations between self-reports and viewer ratings were overall small, suggesting that there is little consensus between social media users and the cyber audience across individual ratings. Furthermore, the difference between viewer ratings and participants&#x02019; self-ratings at the group level was significant across almost all measures. Thus, both individual-level correlations and group-level comparisons suggest little consistency between self-ratings and viewer-ratings of Facebook users&#x02019; personal characteristics. These findings contrast with previous research showing that observers are highly accurate in perceiving the personality of social media users based on personal blogs and profiles where personal characteristics are often explicitly and coherently articulated [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. When processing the seemingly unconnected and disparate social media posts like Facebook status updates, the perception of personal characteristics necessitates an outsourced constructive process of meaning-making in the cyber audience to work out who the author is [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This can in turn contribute to discrepancies between the cyber audience&#x02019;s perceptions of social media users and the users&#x02019; self-views. The current findings thus provide an important extension to the literature on person perception online.</p><p>Furthermore, the discrepancies between the ratings by the cyber audience and Facebook users varied by specific characteristics (H2): Both viewer groups perceived the participants as more disclosive than did the participants themselves. This is consistent with prior studies showing that the cyber audience is sensitive and responsive to self-disclosure in social media posts [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. On the other hand, both viewer groups perceived the participants as of lower self-esteem and less interdependent than how the participants viewed themselves, and viewers of the text group also underestimated the participants&#x02019; extroversion and independence. The findings suggest that these characteristics may be difficult to infer based on the content of the status updates. Interestingly, the perceptions of connectedness were consistent between the Facebook users and the two viewer groups, a characteristic closely related to the social-relational motive of sharing information online [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The cyber audience&#x02019;s accurate perception of the Facebook users&#x02019; connectedness may reflect the notion that posting on social media serves primarily the purpose of connecting with others.</p><p>Importantly, the discrepancies between viewer ratings and participants&#x02019; self-ratings were significant for 3 out of the 6 measures for the multimedia group, and 5 out of the 6 measures for the text group. These findings suggest that viewers of the multimedia group generated relatively more accurate information about the Facebook users than viewers of the text group (H3). This is further confirmed by the consistency scores between participants&#x02019; self-descriptions and the descriptions provided by the viewers about the participants. Compared with the text group viewers, the multimedia group viewers provided more consistent descriptions and fewer inconsistent descriptions, fewer commissions, and fewer omissions. These findings suggest that the multimedia group formed impressions about the Facebook users&#x02019; persona more in line with the users&#x02019; self-views than did the text group. Compared with text-only posts, multimedia posts allow social media users to communicate themselves via diverse means such as photos, videos, and hyperlinks in addition to text, thus containing richer information about who the author is [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This appears to facilitate the cyber audience&#x02019;s meaning making of the online posts to form accurate impressions about the social media users.</p><p>However, viewers of the text group seemed more sensitive to individual variations, whereby their ratings were significantly correlated with the participants&#x02019; self-reports for 3 out of the 6 measures, relative to 1 measure by the multimedia group. Furthermore, viewers of the text group exhibited a greater consensus in their ratings on 4 out of the 6 characteristics of the Facebook users than did viewers of the multimedia group (H4). It is possible that the diverse forms of information in multimedia posts may result in more individual differences in the meaning-making process and, in turn, contribute to more inconsistent views among the cyber audience members, when compared with text-only posts. Notably, there was an overall good consensus within each viewer group across most measures, consistent with prior findings of personality perception based on personal blogs and profiles [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It is further in line with the notion of the transactive mind of the virtual community, where the cyber audience members engage in a shared process of meaning-making to derive information from diverse social media posts about who the author is [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In the real-life social media context, the cyber audience members often interact with each other and exchange information about the author, which can further contribute to shared views in the virtual community about the author&#x02019;s persona [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Some interesting results emerged pertaining to gender and ethnicity (H5), in line with findings of personality judgments in offline contexts [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Both viewer groups perceived greater extraversion in female than male Facebook users, which is in line with the general finding that women tend to score higher on extraversion than men [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Also consistent with the gendered self-construal [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], viewers perceived greater connectedness and interdependence in female than male Facebook users. Viewers of the multimedia group also rated women higher than men on independence. Interestingly, Facebook users themselves did not show gender differences in their self-reports in any of these personal characteristics except connectedness. Given that the viewers were blind to the participants&#x02019; names and other identifiable information, these findings may suggest that social media users present themselves in online posts generally in line with their gendered characteristics and that women may be more expressive than men in their online posts. The findings further suggest that the cyber audience can derive these gendered characteristics through meaning making of the social media users&#x02019; posts, especially with the assistance of multimedia tools.</p><p>Similarly, in line with prior findings that Westerners such as White Americans tend to score higher on extraversion than Asians [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294990.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], viewers of the multimedia group perceived White Facebook users as more extroverted than Asians, although Facebook users did not differ in their self-reports. Both groups of viewers and Facebook users themselves perceived White Facebook users as of higher self-esteem than Asians. This is consistent with the notion that Western cultures place a greater value on self-enhancement and positive self-regard than East Asian cultures, and that individuals in turn view and present themselves within their respective cultural frameworks [<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0294990.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Taken together, the findings suggest the impact of culture on the dynamic interaction between social media users&#x02019; private self-views, their self-presentations online, and the cyber audience&#x02019;s meaning making of the users&#x02019; social media posts.</p><p>Although the current studies yielded original findings on how Facebook users&#x02019; persona was perceived by the cyber audience based on status updates and the factors that influence the audience&#x02019;s meaning-making process, there are important limitations. In particular, the viewers only read the 20 most recent status updates of the Facebook users. It is possible that they can form more accurate perceptions of the Facebook users&#x02019; persona based on a longer history of status updates. Also, the viewers did not see comments on the status updates or share information with each other as they might in actual online contexts. Future research that considers these factors will reveal additional nuances of the cyber audience&#x02019;s meaning making of online posts. In addition, the current study focused on Facebook users&#x02019; personal and demographic characteristics in relation to the cyber audience&#x02019;s perception of their persona based on status updates. Future research should examine the characteristics of the cyber audience in influencing how social media users are perceived, and also study the outsourced meaning-making process on other popular social media sites such as Instagram and TikTok. Additional research should also examine the contribution of different media formats to impression formation as new technological features continue being introduced to social media platforms for individuals to share their experiences online.</p><p>In conclusion, the current study yielded original findings on the dynamic interplay between social media users and the cyber audience in impression formation based on online posts. Although authentic self-presentation online is associated with many psychological benefits, it may not be accurately perceived by others in the process of making sense of the social media users&#x02019; posts, especially for certain personal characteristics not easily inferable from the posts. The presentational formats further differentially influence the accuracy and consensus of the cyber audience&#x02019;s meaning making of the users&#x02019; persona. Still, cyber audience members are better at inferring user characteristics that serve social motives, and they show an overall good consensus in their person perceptions. They also appear to be able to derive some of the gendered and cultured characteristics of the Facebook users from the status updates. Taken together, with the meaning-making process outsourced to the cyber audience, the construction of a digitally extended self of the social media users is a dynamic process that takes place not only through user self-presentations but also in the transactive mind of the virtual community.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank members of the Cornell Culture &#x00026; Cognition Lab for their assistance, including Arpita Bose, Christopher DeMatteo, Radhika Ghosalkar, Samir Khirie, Chun-I Jenny Yang, Danielle Li, Stacey Chen, Steven Lai, Sue Choi, Saadat Badruddin, and Gerrard Boucaud.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0294990.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Q.</given-names></name> (<year>2022</year>). <article-title>The triangular self in the social media era.</article-title>
