The BALB/c mouse, currently used as a model for studying RSV immunopathology, is semi-permissive to the virus. A mouse model that more closely mimics human RSV infection is needed. Since immunocompromised conditions increase risk of RSV infection, the possibility of enhancing RSV infection in the BALB/c mouse by pretreatment with cyclophosphamide was examined in this study. BALB/c mice were treated with cyclophosphamide (CYP) and five days later, they were infected with RSV intranasally. Pulmonary RSV titers, inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness were measured five days after infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>CYP-treated mice show higher RSV titers in their lungs of than the untreated mice. Also, a decreased percentage of macrophages and an increased number of lymphocytes and neutrophils were present in the BAL of CYP-treated mice compared to controls. The CYP-treated group also exhibited augmented bronchoalveolar and interstitial pulmonary inflammation. The increased RSV infection in CYP-treated mice was accompanied by elevated expression of IL-10, IL-12 and IFN-&#x003b3; mRNAs and proteins compared to controls. Examination of CYP-treated mice before RSV infection showed that CYP treatment significantly decreased both IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-12 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results demonstrate that CYP-treated BALB/c mice provide a better model for studying RSV immunopathology and that decreased production of IL-12 and IFN-&#x003b3; are important determinants of susceptibility to RSV infection.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important respiratory pathogen that produces an annual worldwide epidemic of respiratory illness primarily in children, but also in the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In the USA alone, RSV infection of children causes about 100,000 hospitalizations and 4,500 deaths annually (MMWR, 1996). RSV commonly precipitates bronchiolitis and exacerbates asthma but is also associated with severe life threatening respiratory infections in individuals with coronary artery disease or who are immunocompromised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. At the molecular level, RSV infection up-regulates the expression of several cytokines and chemokines, such as IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-&#x003b1;, MIP1&#x003b1;, RANTES, and the adhesion molecule ICAM-1, ET-1, LTB4 and LTC4/D4/E4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, elevated levels of cytokines and chemokines have been found in the nasal secretions of naturally RSV-infected children and of artificially-infected adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Defects in IL-12 and IFN-&#x003b1; production have been associated with severe RSV disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Despite progress in our understanding of immunopathology, the lack of a suitable animal model, with pathophysiology similar to humans, allowing appropriate virology, immunology, pathology and toxicology testing, has hindered the development of prophylactic and therapeutic interventions against RSV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The pathology of RSV infection has been examined in a number of animals including primates, cotton rats, mice, calves, guinea pigs, ferrets and hamsters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The choice of an experimental model is governed by the specific manifestation of the disease. The development of multiple animal models reflects the multifaceted nature of human RSV disease, in which clinical manifestations and sequelae depend upon age, genetic makeup, immunologic status and concurrent disease status of the individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Currently there is no single animal model that duplicates all forms of RSV disease. While cotton rats provide a good model for toxicologic evaluations, mice are considered advantageous for immunology and vaccine development. Furthermore, in mice the importance of IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-13 has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The mouse provides an excellent model for human RSV infection because of the following: (a) the mouse is the best-characterized animal model, and experiments can be performed in this model in a cost- and time-effective manner, (b) a wide array of immunological reagents is available for studies in this model, and (c) the A2 strain of human RSV administered intranasally readily infects lungs of mice, and exhibits a time course of infection, pathology and resolution similar to that seen in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Treatment of mice with the anti-RSV compound ribavirin decreases RSV titers in the lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Depending upon the amount of RSV administered, the illness in micemay range from mild pneumonitis of the lung to weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Healthy BALB/c mice are semi-permissive to RSV and develop only limited inflammation and airway reactivity. Based on the reports that deficiency in IL-12 and IFN production increases severity of RSV disease, we hypothesized that rendering mice immunocompromised, will improve permissiveness to RSV and provide a better model for RSV infection. To test this hypothesis, BALB/c were treated with cyclophosphamide, infected with RSV, and characterized in terms of viral infectivity and pathology, immunology, and immunohistology. The results show that cyclophosphamide temporarily decreases IL-12 production and thus augments viral replication and the immunopathology of RSV disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Female six-week old BALB/c mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and maintained in a pathogen-free environment.

A semi-quantitative evaluation of inflammatory cells in the lung sections was performed as previously described (Kumar et al., 1999). Whole lung homogenates were prepared using a TissueMizer and assayed for cytokines IL-10, IL-12 and IFN-&#x003b3; by ELISA (R &#x00026; D Systems, Minneapolis MN), following the manufacturer's directions.

The cell suspensions were then centrifuged onto glass slides using a cytospin centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature. Cytocentrifuged cells were air dried and stained with a modified Wright's stain (Leukostat, Fisher Scientific, Atlanta, GA) which allows differential counting of monocytes and lymphocytes.

Pretreatment of BALB/c mice with CYP results in RSV titers in the lungs of these immunocompromised mice that are increased significantly compared to the group infected with RSV without cyclophosphamide treatment. These results are consistent with an earlier study in the cotton rat model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In another study, a high titer RSV inoculum (10<sup>7 </sup>PFU/ml) was administered intranasally to old mice and resulted in clinical illness and appreciable pathology in the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], while mice inoculated with 10<sup>6 </sup>PFU/ml, or less, did not exhibit symptoms of illness. Most studies using mice as models employ lower doses of RSV because RSV infection in humans, which induces a pneumonia-like pulmonary inflammation, occurs typically at sub-clinical RSV doses. The loss of body weight in CYP-treated mice following RSV infection compared to untreated control mice confirmed that CYP-treatment increased the susceptibility to RSV infection at lower inocula. This finding that permissiveness to RSV can be augmented by rendering mice immunocompromised is significant, as it increases the utility of the mouse model for RSV infection.</p><p>Consistent with increased RSV infection, the cellular population in BAL fluid was altered. Especially significant are the increases in lymphocytes and neutrophils in CYP-treated mice compared to controls. This data is in agreement with previous reports showing that RSV infection increased lymphocyte infiltration in the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Along with increased cellular infiltration, lung pathology, particularly epithelial denudation and goblet cell hyperplasia, is also markedly increased.</p><p>Expression of IL-10, IL-12 and IFN-&#x003b3; was examined to determine if RSV-induced changes in the levels of these cytokines in the lungs of CYP-treated mice played a role in the increased lung immunopathology. RSV-infected CYP-treated mice exhibited significantly increased expression of these cytokines at the protein and mRNA level in agreement with previous observations that RSV infection induced enhanced expression of Th1 and Th2 cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Other studies have shown that IFN-&#x003b3; can induce production of IL-12 in a self-activating loop, by activating macrophages which produce IL-12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Although CYP treatment is known to induce an immunosuppressed condition, the mechanism is unclear. The results of cytokine analysis on days 1 to 5 after cyclophosphamide treatment indicated that IL-12 and IFN-&#x003b3; were reduced and the reduction was highest on days four and two, respectively. These results suggest that the ability of cells to produce these cytokines at the time of RSV infection is an important determinant of the magnitude of infection in terms of increased RSV replication and titer. Impairment in IL-12 and IFN-&#x003b3; production at the key moment of acute infection leads to rapid viral replication and subsequent pathology. In a previous report we demonstrated the importance of IFN-&#x003b3; by artificially increasing IFN-&#x003b3; levels and showing that viral titers were decreased because of the induction of 2'-5'oligoadenylate synthetase which activates RNase L to degrade viral RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Also, studies in humans have suggested that individuals lacking IFN-&#x003b1; or IL-12 are at a higher risk of severe RSV disease. Thus, down-regulation of the production of these cytokines is a likely factor underlying the observed enhancement of RSV infection by cyclophosphamide treatment.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate that cyclophosphamide treatment of BALB/c mice renders them more susceptible to RSV infection as revealed by increased RSV titers in the lung and decreased body weight. The mechanism of this increase in infection involves transient down regulation of IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-12 induced by cyclophosphamide treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing Interests</title><p>The
