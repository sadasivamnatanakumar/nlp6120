Here, we present a comprehensive computational study to identify potential inhibitors of SIRT1 (Sirtuin 1), a critical protein involved in various cellular processes and disease pathways. Leveraging the concept of drug repurposing, we employed a multifaceted approach that integrates molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict the binding affinities and dynamic behavior of a diverse set of FDA-approved drugs from DrugBank against the SIRT1. Initially, compounds were shortlisted based on their binding affinities and interaction analyses to identify safe and promising binding partners for SIRT1. Among these candidates, Doxercalciferol and Timiperone emerged as potential candidates, displaying notable affinity, efficiency, and specificity towards the binding pocket of SIRT1. Extensive evaluation revealed that these identified compounds boast a range of favorable biological properties and prefer binding to the active site of SIRT1. To delve deeper into the interactions, all-atom MD simulations were conducted for 500 nanoseconds (ns). These simulations assessed the conformational dynamics, stability, and interaction mechanism of the SIRT1-Doxercalciferol and SIRT1-Timiperone complexes. The MD simulations illustrated that the SIRT1-Doxercalciferol and SIRT1-Timiperone complexes maintain stability over a 500 ns trajectory. These insightful outcomes propose that Doxercalciferol and Timiperone hold promise as viable scaffolds for developing potential SIRT1 inhibitors, with implications for tackling complex diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic syndromes.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

Introduction</title><p>Identifying novel therapeutic agents to combat a spectrum of diseases, ranging from cancer and neurodegenerative disorders to metabolic syndromes, is a formidable challenge in modern drug discovery [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The complexities of these diseases often stem from the dysregulation of complex molecular pathways, necessitating a multifaceted approach that encompasses a deep understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As these diseases&#x02019; biological and biochemical complexities continue to be unveiled, various innovative drug discovery approaches emerged over the years [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. One such approach gaining significant attention is drug repurposing&#x02013;the concept of repositioning existing drugs originally developed for one therapeutic purpose into novel applications [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This strategy presents an avenue for expedited drug development, avoiding the lengthy timelines and extensive costs associated with <italic toggle="yes">de novo</italic> drug design and development [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Moreover, repurposing existing drugs capitalizes on the extensive knowledge about their safety profiles and accelerates the translation of research findings into substantial clinical benefits [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>This study comprehensively explored drug repurposing approach targeting the Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) protein. SIRT1, a member of the sirtuin family of NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent histone deacetylases, has emerged as an important protein with a multifaceted role in numerous cellular processes [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. With its involvement in various physiological pathways, including metabolism, DNA repair, apoptosis, and inflammation, SIRT1 has gotten considerable attention as a potential therapeutic target for various diseases [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Among these, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer&#x02019;s, Huntington&#x02019;s and Parkinson&#x02019;s diseases, as well as metabolic syndromes including obesity and diabetes, stand out as areas of substantial interest [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0293185.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0293185.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. SIRT1 comprises three major structured regions: the N-terminal region spanning residues 183&#x02013;229, the catalytic core region encompassing residues 229&#x02013;516, and a distant region around 641&#x02013;665 known as the C-terminal regulatory segment (CTR) peptide [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Residues 183&#x02013;229 within the N-terminal region of SIRT1 play a pivotal role in binding sirtuin&#x02013;activating compounds (STACs). Meanwhile, substrate binding takes place within the catalytic domain of SIRT1, which consists of a large NAD<sub>+</sub> binding Rossmann-fold domain and a smaller zinc-binding domain [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>SIRT1 plays a dual role in disease progression [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0293185.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Its function varies across different stages of tumorigenesis, depending upon tissue context and cancer type. Furthermore, SIRT1 can exhibit distinct expression patterns at various stages of tumor development [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Clinically, elevated SIRT1 expression has been associated with relapsed patients, and those with high SIRT1 expression tend to have poorer outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Studies have delineated the multifaceted role of SIRT1 in different stages of cancer, including its involvement in genome instability, tumor initiation, proliferation, metabolism, and therapeutic responses [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Consequently, SIRT1 inhibitors have exhibited promising anti-cancer effects in animal models of cancer [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. There are a few SIRT1 inhibitors known such as, Cambinol analogs [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], Sirtinol [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and Selisistat [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Clinical trials have demonstrated that Sirt1 inhibition by Selisistat can restore transcriptional dysregulation in models of Huntington&#x02019;s disease [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The critical regulatory functions of SIRT1 in these diseases highlight its potential as a pharmacological target, prompting efforts to identify selective and potent inhibitors that can modulate its aberrant activity [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Historically, drug discovery has often been driven by the search for compounds with novel chemical structures and mechanisms of action [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, this approach can be hampered by high failure rates, lengthy development timelines, and mounting costs. As a response to these challenges, drug repurposing has emerged as a reasonable alternative [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Repurposing leverages existing knowledge about approved drugs&#x02019; safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics and repurposes them for new indications, thereby accelerating the translation of promising compounds into clinical practice [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. By harnessing this approach, we can optimize the use of existing resources in terms of data and compounds to address unmet medical needs more swiftly.</p><p>The advent of computational biology and bioinformatics has dramatically transformed the drug discovery landscape [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Integrating <italic toggle="yes">in silico</italic> techniques, such as molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, has paved the way for rational and efficient drug design strategies [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Molecular docking facilitates the prediction of the binding interactions between a protein target and small molecule ligands, thereby enabling the identification of potential drug candidates [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Subsequently, MD simulations enable us to investigate the dynamic behavior and stability of protein-ligand complexes at an atomistic level, providing insights into the conformational changes and binding mechanisms that underlie their interactions [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. When applied synergistically, molecular docking and MD simulations offer a powerful platform for virtual screening and lead optimization, considerably expediting the drug discovery pipeline [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>In the context of SIRT1 inhibition, this study seeks to bridge the gap between computational methodologies and therapeutic potential. We aim to identify and evaluate promising FDA-approved drugs that could serve as SIRT1 inhibitors by employing a systematic and comprehensive bioinformatics approach. Using repurposed drugs as potential inhibitors offers a unique advantage by tapping into their established safety profiles, potentially reducing the barriers associated with drug development. Our approach integrates molecular docking and MD simulations to predict binding affinities, interaction patterns, and dynamic behaviors of a diverse range of FDA-approved drugs against the SIRT1 protein. This strategy aims to uncover candidate compounds with the propensity to bind to the active site of SIRT1 and inhibit its activity, thereby modulating disease-relevant pathways.</p><p>The initial compounds were shortlisted based on binding affinities and interaction analyses. Among these, Doxercalciferol and Timiperone emerge as a promising candidate, demonstrating remarkable affinity, efficiency, and specificity for the SIRT1 binding pocket. We then proceed to an in-depth evaluation of Doxercalciferol and Timiperone&#x02019;s potential as SIRT1 inhibitors, emphasizing their favorable biological properties and preference for binding to the active site of SIRT1. We employed all-atom MD simulations to unravel the dynamic behavior of the SIRT1-Doxercalciferol and SIRT1-Timiperone complexes, which reveal the complex&#x02019;s stability and interaction mechanisms over an extended trajectory of 500 nanoseconds (ns). Our findings not only shed light on the binding characteristics of Doxercalciferol and Timiperone but also underline the utility of computational approaches in drug repurposing. Ultimately, our study presents Doxercalciferol and Timiperone as promising scaffolds for developing potential SIRT1 inhibitors, offering implications for therapeutic interventions in complex diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>2. Material and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>2.1 Data preparation: SIRT1 structure and FDA-approved drugs database</title><p>An established computational workflow for drug design and discovery was employed, utilizing various bioinformatics tools, including MGL AutoDock Tools [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], AutoDock Vina [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], Discovery Studio Visualizer [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and GROMACS [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], to conduct virtual screening (VS) and MD simulations. The three-dimensional crystal structure of the human SIRT1 protein was retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 4I5I) [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Before the docking study, the protein structure was checked for missing atoms, solvent compounds, and heteroatoms. The protein structure was then prepared by removing water molecules and other non-essential components. The energy minimization of the SIRT1 structure was performed in Swiss-PDB-Viewer tool [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Hydrogens were added, and protonation states were adjusted based on the physiological pH using MGL AutoDock tools. A comprehensive dataset of 3648 FDA-approved drugs was sourced from DrugBank [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This dataset was filtered to exclude biologics, peptides, and other non-small molecule compounds, resulting in a curated collection of small molecule FDA-approved drugs. Each drug molecule was retrieved in SDF 3D structure for subsequent molecular docking. The 3D structures of the FDA-approved drug compounds were subjected to energy minimization and geometry optimization using GROMOS 43B1 force field [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The MGL AutoDock tools were utilized for ligand preparation. The prepared ligands were then subjected to ionization state prediction and tautomeric enumeration, ensuring an accurate representation of the potential ligand conformations.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>2.2 Molecular docking screening</title><p>We performed a molecular docking-based virtual screening (VS) to filter compounds based on their binding affinities towards SIRT1. Molecular docking studies were performed using AutoDock Vina, a widely utilized docking program. The protein structure was prepared by adding polar hydrogens and assigning charges. The grid was generated around the whole SIRT1 using blind dimensions. The grid dimensions for the X, Y, and Z coordinates were defined as follows: X-axis = 51 &#x000c5;, Y-axis = 83 &#x000c5;, and Z-axis = 65 &#x000c5;.

A uniform grid spacing of 1 &#x000c5; was employed. All other parameters related to the molecular docking procedure were maintained at their default settings. Vina standard VS protocol was employed initially to screen the entire FDA-approved drug dataset. The robustness of the docking protocol was rigorously confirmed using a redocking approach, a well-established and extensively documented technique in the scientific literature [<xref rid="pone.0293185.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Specifically, the validation process of the Vina-default docking protocol entailed a comprehensive assessment through retrospective docking. This assessment involved redocking a co-crystalized reference inhibitor (Selisistat analogue, (6S)-2-chloro-5,6,7,8,9,10-hexahydrocyclohepta[b]indole-6-carboxamide) with SIRT1, followed by a comparison between docked and co-crystalized poses.</p><p>The results of this validation step unequivocally demonstrated the precise and reliable performance of our docking protocol. Notably, the Selisistat analogue, when subjected to our docking methodology, consistently predicts a binding pose that corresponded precisely to the location of the co-crystallized Selisistat analogue within the SIRT1 structure (PDB ID: 4I5I). This convergence of binding poses was visually depicted in <bold><xref rid="pone.0293185.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref></bold>, where the binding configurations of the docked Selisistat analogue and the crystallographically determined Selisistat analogue were superimposed. In essence, the superimposition of the docked and co-crystallized Selisistat analogues&#x02019; binding poses serves as compelling evidence of the accuracy and effectiveness of our docking protocol. This validation procedure, underpinned by a redocking strategy, reinforces the reliability of our approach and underscores its potential utility in guiding further studies and applications within the realm of molecular docking and ligand interaction analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>2.3 Scoring and interaction analysis</title><p>The docking results were analyzed based on their Vina score and ligand efficiency, which combines multiple energy terms to predict binding affinities.

This study highlights how AI-driven algorithms can efficiently narrow down extensive screening collections to target-specific sets comprising only a few hundred small molecules. This approach greatly accelerates and streamlines the process of discovering potential hits, offering a more cost-effective and rapid path to drug discovery. In summary, these findings unequivocally emphasize the valuable applications of computational approaches and their significant potential in advancing drug discovery, particularly in the context of SIRT1 targeting.</p><p>Here, we conducted a rigorous screening of a comprehensive library comprising FDA-approved compounds, with a particular focus on their binding potential and pharmacological attributes.
