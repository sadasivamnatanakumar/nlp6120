Mali [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], Bangladesh [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and South Africa [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] follow the same standard of child vaccination. Although there is a lot of success in eliminating vaccine-preventable diseases in developed countries, children in low-income countries are not still obtaining sufficient services because of the limited health system capacity, problems with the acceptability of the vaccine, and economic barriers to the service as a few reasons among all [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The complete or partial lack of those vaccines, mostly in low and middle-income countries, contributes to around three million preventable child losses each year [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0293522.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This full vaccination for children could not be achieved in most countries of the world [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. To make changes in this regards the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the Expanded Immunization Program (EPI) in 1974 [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Since its introduction the EPI has increased the global uptake for the four core vaccination (BCG, DPT, OPV, and MCV) from 5% in 1973 to over 80% in 2009 [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0293522.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Afterward, in 2012 the World Health Assembly of 194 member states endorsed the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) intending to put a framework to prevent millions of deaths by 2020 through equitable access to vaccines across the world [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The GVAP was a step toward universal health coverage (UHC) [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines UHC as &#x0201c;all people have access to the health services they need, when and where they need them, without financial hardship. It includes the full range of essential health services, from health promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Equity is an inherent dimension, which helps to systematically follow the status of UHC of different health service interventions. Despite these facts, full child vaccination has continued to be pro-rich in many low-income countries [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies in this area depict a social gradient in utilizing full child vaccination within a country [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In most cases, economically better-off countries are better in their health systems to give better health access to their citizens. Many low-income countries, on the other hand, are short of many aspects to fulfill the health service needs of the people [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0293522.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

As per our best search, how far the economically well countries went to fill the service gap between the poor, and rich within the country and how they are different from low-income countries is not well studied.</p><p>Besides, variables deemed important to assess the social determinants of health according to the WHO-commissioned social determinants of health inequality framework, [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] were examined in this study. The framework illustrates that socioeconomic stratifications like income, education, occupation, gender, and race/ethnicity determine people&#x02019;s place in a social hierarchy (intermediary variables) like living/working conditions, behavioral, and psychological factors; which finally leads to differences in experiencing exposure and vulnerability to health-compromising conditions [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>In general, theorists frame inequity in health as unavoidable versus avoidable; individual versus group; absolute versus relative, and so on [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Given it is a global concern, investigating both within and between country inequity assists global and local researchers and decision-makers to identify gaps and learn from experiences. Therefore, in this study, we presented the full child vaccination coverage, within and across countries wealth-based inequalities, and the possible predictors of inequalities by randomly selecting three countries (Mali, Bangladesh, and South Africa) from low-income (LI), lower-middle-income (LMI) and upper-middle-income (UMI) countries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study setting, and period</title><p>In this study, we presented the experience of Mali, Bangladesh, and South Africa.

A two-stage household-based sampling design is used while dividing the country into enumeration areas (EA), A geographic area containing 131 households, then a complete list of EAs that covers the survey country serves as a sampling frame for the study. A further stage of sampling will be conducted to identify study participants. We considered the child data and took children under the age of five as the study population for this study.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Variables of the study</title><p>The dependent variable for this study was full child vaccination status: a single dose of Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG); three doses of diphtheria, tetanus toxoids, and pertussis (DTP); three doses of oral polio vaccine; and one dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV). Accordingly, if the child received all the listed recommended vaccines, he/she was coded as 1, and 0 otherwise.</p><p>To identify the social determinants of full child vaccination as per the WHO&#x02019;s conceptual framework, a set of accessible variables from the DHS database was considered for this study. Accordingly, the sex of the child, age of the mother, number of children in the house, ANC attendance, maternal education, occupation, wealth quantile, frequency of listening to radio, frequency of watching television, distance from the health facility, place of residence were included in the analysis.</p><p>To calculate the household&#x02019;s wealth, the DHS program uses a wealth index that has a composite score of the household&#x02019;s living standard calculated using data on the household&#x02019;s ownership of selected assets, and materials then the final wealth quintile will be obtained after valuation and analysis using the principal component analysis.

The maternal level of education was the highest attainment in school and categorized as no education (1), primary education (2), secondary education (3), and tertiary education (4). To categorize places of residence, the DHS program uses country-specific classification to categorize into rural (0) and urban (1). The sex of the child was categorized into male and female; the mother&#x02019;s age in the five years group and the marital status of the mother were included in the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The wealth-based equity in using vaccination services for children in this study was measured using rate-ratio, concentration curve, and concentration index (CInd). The rate ratio indicates the degree to which the economically better off utilize health services (child vaccination) as compared to poorer quintiles. It was computed by dividing the proportion of service users in the highest wealth quintile by the proportion in the bottom wealth quintile. Then, Concentration curves were plotted considering the cumulative percentage of the full vaccination (y-axis) against the cumulative percentage of the population, ranked by socio-economic variables (x-axis).</p><p>To quantify the wealth-based equity differences, concentration index values were computed with respective standard errors and a 95% confidence interval. The concentration index is twice the area between the concentration curve and the line of equality (the 45-degree line). The concentration index value ranges from -1 to +1. The convention is that the index takes a negative value when the curve lies above the line of equality (the 45-degree line), indicating the disproportionate concentration of the health variable (vaccination) among the poor, and a positive value when it lies below the line of equality [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0293522.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>The concentration index for t = 1,&#x02026;, T groups was computed in a spreadsheet program using the following formula according to Fuller and Lury, 1977 [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].

Almost all 1701 [97.3], and 3,147 [98.7] women in Mali and Bangladesh respectively were married. However, the highest proportion of 486 [55.1%] in South Africa were single mothers. The majority 1199 [68.6%] of the mothers of vaccinated children in Mali were not educated. Whereas, the highest proportion in Bangladesh 1583 [49.7], and South Africa 719 [81.5] have completed secondary education. Regarding residence, about three-quarters of mothers with fully vaccinated children in Mali and Bangladesh live in rural areas.

Therefore, this study presented the experience of full child vaccination coverage, within and across country wealth-based inequalities, and predictors by taking Mali, Bangladesh, and South Africa.</p><p>The full child vaccination coverage was relatively better (62.9%) in Bangladesh, a LMI country. The result of good child vaccination coverage in Bangladesh might be attributed to the government&#x02019;s initiative to implement a countrywide vaccine campaign like the Measles-rubella campaign in 2014. This increased the vaccination coverage by more than 75% and was certified by WHO as a polio-free country in 2014 [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Moreover, Bangladesh&#x02019;s history in child vaccination coverage from the lowest base was exemplary for its contribution to the high reduction of childhood morbidity and mortality and received two GAVI best performance awards in 2009 and 2012 [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>In our study, the full vaccination coverage in South Africa (46.9%) was lower than in Bangladesh but higher than in Mali (30.2%). In South Africa, while vaccine-preventable diseases are still a threat, a report in 2016 revealed that full child vaccination is deteriorating due to incomplete data, delayed national EPI surveys, inaccurate stock control, and poor cold-chain management [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. On the other side, though Mali set priority agendas to increase full child vaccination by creating community health centers and responsible health committees in 2003; and deploying community health workers in 2011 [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0293522.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], our findings revealed that; Mali, has the least vaccination coverage.</p><p>The other finding in our study revealed that wealth-based Inequality favoring the better-off families was higher in Mali, followed by Bangladesh. In Mali, a 40% difference was observed, whereas it was 22% in Bangladesh. This result is commensurate with the findings of a study in other low-income countries [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0293522.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0293522.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This indicates that the healthcare system in many low-income countries is sub-optimal to reach the poor segment of the population. Even if promising progress regarding universal access to care has been documented in different low and middle-income countries like Burkina Faso, Botswana, and India [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0293522.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] the wealth-based inequality in Mali, Bangladesh, and other similar countries poses a great burden towards the global target of ending preventable child mortality by 2030 [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>We can see the reasons both from the users&#x02019; and service providers&#x02019; perspectives. From the user&#x02019;s viewpoint, access to education, access to the media, transportation access, and other many important aspects are low which, affects citizens of the country, especially the poor to use health services [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0293522.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. From the service providers&#x02019; perspective, the low coverage of infrastructure tackles the health system to address people living in remote and slum areas [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Disproportionate allocation of the national budget for health services in many low-income countries restrains the health system from reaching those hard to reach economically poor proportion of society [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>This multilevel poison regression also revealed that the richest proportion of the community in Mali experienced a better vaccination status. Compared to the richest, children from the richer and poorest families were 26% and 30% less likely to have a full vaccination. The finding is consistent with a finding in Ethiopia, one of the low-income countries, it shows children from a better-off family have a higher likelihood of being fully vaccinated [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Another study also shows that children in Mali were vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The low vaccine coverage in most low-income countries coupled with high socio-economic disparity in full vaccination status contributes to lower achievements in child health indicators.</p><p>The other variable identified was the age of the mother. It was a significant positive driver for child vaccination in all countries included in the study. As age increases by one, the odds of vaccinating the child increase by 2&#x02013;3%. This finding is similar to a study conducted in Afghanistan, a low-income country, which shows the lower the maternal age the lower the probability of child vaccination [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The possible reason might be that; women tend to gain lived experience about the importance of child vaccination either from themselves/ relatives or other neighbors through the years [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p>Maternal occupation was the other variable identified in this study. In Mali, and Bangladesh women having an occupation were 19% and 13% more likely to vaccinate their children respectively. Whereas in South Africa, those having an occupation were 24% less likely to vaccinate their child. The higher odds of child vaccination in women having an occupation are supported in different studies conducted in LMIC [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0293522.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. It is well established that besides being employed gives financial stability to cover the transportation and related costs of child vaccination, it provides better autonomy and decision-making power for a woman [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p><p>The other variable identified was the number of children in the household. Both in Mali and Bangladesh, as the number of the child increased the probability of vaccinating their child went low by 5, and 7% respectively. This study is commensurate with a finding from a study done in Zimbabwe [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. This may be explained as coupled with other burdens in the household; higher family size might create difficulties to afford expenditures associated with vaccination. The last variable identified was the frequency of watching television. The odds of child vaccination increased by 19&#x02013;21% for those watching television at least once or above a week. This finding is supported by different studies in low-income countries [<xref rid="pone.0293522.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0293522.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. As exposure to mass media is found to be a crucial positive driver to increase child vaccination, intervention shall target to increase the information dissemination to favorably impact mothers&#x02019; choices.</p><sec id="sec019"><title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title><p>The identification of wealth-based inequality both within and across the three economically different countries using their recent nationally representative data makes the strength of the study. Besides this, assessing the possible predictors of the resulting inequality using the WHO-commissioned social determinants of health inequality framework provides a summarized way of tackling the social gradients in health. On the other hand, users of this article need to understand a few limitations while reading the findings of this study. In this study, we used data obtained from the DHS Program database, which was used to analyze key health and health-related indicators at the national level. In most cases, the DHS program collects up to five histories for the respondents, which exposes the data to recall bias. Furthermore, we could not find all relevant variables to assess the determinants of social gradients in health. For this reason, this study might have introduced omitted variable bias in the inferential analysis. Future researchers in this area need to assess the wealth-based inequality including more health systems and behavioral factors.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec020"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, compared to Mali and South Africa the vaccination coverage was higher in Bangladesh. Besides this, the vaccination service was far from reaching the poor families in, Mali, and Bangladesh. In South Africa, inequality was not significant. The most important characteristics that create variation in full vaccination status were maternal age, occupation, number of children in the house, frequency of watching television, and wealth of the household. A further study including multiple countries from each economic category would help to better summarize the inequality, as well as to target an intervention at different economic categories.</p></sec><sec id="sec021" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0293522.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>The multilevel poison regression in full child vaccination and equity parameters in Mali, Bangladesh, and South Africa.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0293522.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BCG</term><def><p>Bacille-Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CInd</term><def><p>concentration index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EPI</term><def><p>Expanded Immunization Program</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GVAP</term><def><p>Global Vaccine Action Plan</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MCV</term><def><p>Measles-Containing Vaccine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OPV</term><def><p>Oral Polio Vaccine</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0293522.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">The World Health Organization.

</p><p>Ref: Submission ID PONE-D-22-32266</p><p>Title: The Socio-economic Inequity in Full Child Vaccination Coverage: An Experience from Mali, Bangladesh, and South Africa.</p><p>Response to editor and reviewers' comments</p><p>Dear Editor,</p><p>Thank you very much for giving us a chance to revise our manuscript and for your time reviewing our submission. We revised our manuscript based on the comments raised by the editor, and reviewers. We found all of the comments relevant to improve the article; we now prepared three files for submission including the manuscript main document with track changes, the manuscript main document clean copy, and this rebuttal letter. Please find them below. </p><p>Response to editor comments</p><p>The authors considered three countries Bangladesh, Mali, and South Africa for comparing the vaccination coverage. However, these three countries are quite different from the cultural point of view. Thus, it is very important to justify the selection of these countries.</p><p>Response: Thank you very much for raising such an important concern. We also believe that it needs a thorough discussion. For this study, to see the experience, and take lessons; we randomly selected three countries from different economic categories and see the full vaccination coverage; and within and across countries inequalities in child vaccination. It is correct that the presented countries are different in terms of culture, religion, and economy. However, our primary objective of this study is not to compare the three countries with the above parameters, but to explore the pro-rich inequalities within each as well as the inequality across the three economies, so this study will serve as an experience for bigger studies at Low and Middle-Income Countries. We have justified this in the last paragraph of the background section. </p><p>The authors used the 2018 DHS of Mali, 2014 of Bangladesh, and the 2016 data set of South Africa.

Therefore, The results should be updated based on recent data. </p><p>Response: Thank you very much, dear Editor. It is an important concern, and we fully accept that. After we received your comments, we run the analysis again to double-check which dataset we used during the analysis for Bangladesh. We made sure that, the dataset we reported was BDHS 2017/18 despite it being mentioned as 2014. It was just a typo. Accordingly, we presented the 2018 DHS of Mali, 2017/18 of Bangladesh, and 2016 data of South Africa in the revised document.</p><p>It is possible to check the analysis using the following STATA codes after waiting for cluster differences. </p><p>Waiting </p><p>gen WGT = v005/1000000</p><p>For the descriptive statistics please use [iweight=WGT] just after each line.</p><p>Define full vaccination before the concentration curve and index analysis: </p><p>clorenz fulvax, rank(v190)</p><p>conindex fulvax, rankvar(v190) bounded limits(0 1)</p><p>Journal Requirements:</p><p>When submitting your revision, we need you to address these additional requirements.Please ensure that your manuscript meets PLOS ONE's style requirements, including those for file naming.

We have now included the caption for the supplementary information. </p><p>Response to Reviewer #1</p><p>Dear reviewer, </p><p>We would like to thank you for your time in reviewing our manuscript and we appreciate all of your effort to make our work better. Those were great inputs to improve this manuscript. Accordingly, we took enough time to revise the whole manuscript based on your suggestions and forwarded the following responses for all of your concerns point-by-point fashion as follows,</p><p>1. Author are looking at the socio economic inequity in vaccination coverage. However, they need to give clarity on why and how they have selected variables to represents socio-economic. if only going for wealth and education, they should have gone more in-depth analysis. it is quite well established for the variables they selected. Also the why Bangladesh, Mali and South Africa were compared. These countries are quite different from each other. A rationale explaining comparing three countries are required. The discussion might also explained results providing more context to each countries</p><p>Response: Dear reviewer, we fully accept your comment. We indeed aimed to assess the presence of within and across-country inequality in full child vaccination taking some individual characteristics. In this assessment, we used the WHO-commissioned social determinants of health inequality framework (A Conceptual Framework for Action on the Social Determinants of Health (<ext-link xlink:href="http://who.int" ext-link-type="uri">who.int</ext-link>)) to test equity-related determinants of full vaccination. We explicitly mentioned this in the revised version of the manuscript. To reveal the content of the document very well, as our focus is to study the inequality resulting from the wealth status of the household, we modified the title to &#x0201c;Wealth-based inequity in full child vaccination coverage: An experience from Mali, Bangladesh, and South Africa. A multilevel poison regression&#x0201d;</p><p>In this study, to see the experience, and take lessons; we randomly selected three countries from different economic categories and see the full vaccination coverage; and within and across countries inequalities in child vaccination. It is correct that the presented countries are different in terms of culture, religion, and economy. However, our primary objective of this study was not to compare the three countries with the above parameters but to explore the pro-rich inequalities within each as well as the inequality across the three economies, so this study will serve as an experience for bigger studies at Low and Middle-Income Countries. We have justified this in the last paragraph of the background section. </p><p>2. Again Age, Gender, education, wealth and place of residents are variables which are quite well researched to impact child health and vaccination coverage. different linkages between them or more in-depth analysis of one of the variable will bring more useful results and will add to what is already known.</p><p>Response: Thank you very much, dear reviewer. You are right; several studies reported these variables. In this study, we followed the WHO-commissioned social determinants of health inequality framework (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241500852" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241500852</ext-link>). The framework illustrates the socioeconomic stratifications of the individual in the community like income, education, occupation, gender, and race/ethnicity are individual and community-level factors that determine the inequality in health. We did a detailed and sub-group analysis using the variables wealth, maternal education, and place of residence. Furthermore, the variety of analysis methods that we employed makes our study detailed and different. In the final analysis, we have used these variables that can be accessed from the DHS program of the three countries. We have elaborated this in the 5th paragraph of the introduction section, and methods, and variables of the study sub-section. </p><p>3. South Africa seems to have no wealth inequality (figure 2). but complete immunization is low in south Africa.</p><p>Response: To clarify this issue, it is correct that in South Africa, an upper middle-income country, the full child vaccination is 46.9%, which is lower than Bangladesh, a lower middle-income country, but higher than Mali, a low-income country. This result is somehow different from our hypothesis that assumes countries of a higher economic category are most likely to have better full child vaccination coverage due to a relatively better health system&#x02019;s capacity to provide a better health service. This could be due to other factors, which were not included in this study. On the other side, the full child vaccination favors the wealthiest family in both Mali and Bangladesh though it is higher in Mali. This shows that the service in South Africa is not pro-rich or the poor use the services to the same degree as the rich use. </p><p>4. The context is missing for comparing these countries and inequality results are contradictory.</p><p>Response: To explain this, evidence suggests that many economically better-off countries are better in their health systems to give better health access to their citizens. Many low-income countries, on the other hand, are short of many aspects to fulfill the health service needs of the people. Therefore, in this study, we wanted to see the experience of countries with different economic classifications. Accordingly, we selected one country from each of low income, lower-middle-income, and upper-middle-income countries using a random selection method. Then wealth-based inequality was assessed to measure the level of disparity between the poor and rich segments of the population in their status of full child vaccination. As per the results, the inequality was scientifically significant in Mali, and Bangladesh, and the child vaccination was in favor of the wealthiest. But we understand and mentioned that the finding is not generalizable to other countries in the respective economic category and it is the experience of the three countries. </p><p>5. The writing is generic at times as well for example: " A further study including multiple countries and exploring many reasons for inequality in lower-income countries would help for a better intervention that reduces the equity gap." The sentence is contradictory itself. why author did not do multi country analysis while the data is available from DHS. Arriving at same solution for all country will be difficult.</p><p>Response: Thank you very much for this valuable suggestion. What we have tried to emphasize in our research is to examine the experience/lesson of three randomly selected countries from different economic categories, and see the inequality in full child vaccination status so that this research will serve as a base for further studies. We have modified the statement at the end of the conclusion section of the revised manuscript. </p><p>Response to Reviewer #2</p><p>Dear reviewer: We would like to thank you for your time in reviewing our manuscript. We found all of them to be detrimental to the improvement of the paper. Accordingly, we took enough time to revise the whole manuscript based on your suggestions and forwarded the following responses for all of your concerns point-by-point fashion as follows,</p><p>This article addressed a good topic but they did not applied a sophisticated statistical methods. They used logistic regression, already many articles has been published using this method on this topic in Bangladesh and South Africa. In case of Bangladesh they used DHS-2014 old data file while the recent data set is available, for Mali they used 2018 and for south Africa they used 2016 data file, So, the comparison is meaningless.</p><p>Response: Dear reviewer, you raised critical issues that help us improve our work. Regarding the inferential analysis, you are right binary logistic regression is common in vaccine coverage studies. We had a thorough discussion with the co-author and having a review of the literature, we changed the inferential analysis to a multi-level poison regression adding other relevant independent predictors. </p><p>1. Explain the research objectives mentioning the research gap in Introduction section.</p><p>Response: Thank you very much, dear reviewer, we have revised the whole introduction section, and we have added the research gap and objectives of the study at the end of the introduction section in the revised manuscript. </p><p>2. Used the Same year data set for all countries and then compare it.</p><p>Response: Thank you very much for this suggestion. I am afraid that DHS Program conducts surveys on similar years across all countries. We chose to consider the most recent datasets of all countries included in the analysis. Accordingly, for the analysis we used 2018, 2017, and 2016 data from Mali, Bangladesh, and South Africa, these are the latest DHS for the three countries, and we believe these are closest enough to conclude.</p><p>3. In Method of Analysis Section (line 167) it was mentioned that P-value is considered 0.25 what is logic beyond this (put a reference) while most of the statistical analysis consider 0.05 for variable selection.</p><p>Response: Dear reviewer, thank you for this valuable comment. Since we have changed the method of analysis to a multilevel poison regression, we have removed this statement, and for now, we used a p-value of 0.05 to judge the statistical significance of variables. We have stated this in the methods section under the statistical analysis sub-section.</p><p>4. Line 176: All the analyses were adjusted for clusters and sample weights. Check the cluster effects in the data set while the data is collected from different stratum (clusters).</p><p>Response: The clustering nature of the DHS data might compromise the generalizability of the findings according to the DHS Program. For this reason, we used sampling weights at each stage of analysis. Moreover, we used a multilevel poison regression model to consider different levels of the data collection process. </p><p>5. Use the appropriate statistical methods addressing the clustering effects.</p><p>Response: Thank you for this valuable comment dear reviewer. To minimize the bias associated with the clustering nature of the DHS data, we analyzed the final data using a multilevel poison regression. We have started this discussion in the statistical analysis section of the revised manuscript. </p><p>6. Explain How the sample weights adjusted.</p><p>Response: Thank you for this valuable comment. As the DHS weighs data to account for the disproportionate sampling, and non-response rate; applying sampling weight is recommended to restore the representativeness of the data. </p><p>The good thing with DHS datasets is there is a calculated sampling weight by experts for further use. For the women and children dataset, the sampling weight is named v005. Sample weights are calculated with six decimals but they are presented without that. Therefore, we divided the variable (v005) by 1 million and generated another variable (WGT) [code: gen WGT = v005/1000000]. We then used this weight variable in all the analyses. For instance, in the descriptive analysis to see the prevalence of pentavalent 3 vaccine we analyzed it as: [tab h53 [iweight=WGT]]. In the inferential statistics on the other hand we used [svyset [pw=WGT], psu(v021) strata(v023)].</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0293522.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response letter.pdf</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0293522.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0293522.r003" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0293522.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hossain</surname><given-names>Md.

</p><p>Ref: Submission ID PONE-D-22-32266R1</p><p>Title: Wealth-based inequity in full child vaccination coverage: An experience from Mali, Bangladesh, and South Africa. A multilevel poison regression.</p><p>Response to editor and reviewers' comments</p><p>Response to editor comments</p><p>Dear Editor,</p><p>Thank you very much for taking the time to review our submission, and for allowing us to revise our manuscript. We revised our manuscript based on the comments raised by the editor and the reviewers. We found all of them to be relevant to improve the article; accordingly, we prepared three files for submission including the clean manuscript, the manuscript with track changes, and this rebuttal letter. Please kindly find the point-by-point response below. </p><p>1. Improve the Introduction and Discussion sections based on the most recent article published on this topic considering three countries Bangladesh, Mali, and South Africa.</p><p>Response: We considered your suggestion carefully to revise the introduction and discussion sections and updated them with available recent evidence in the area.</p><p>2. Revise the Methods section as per the reviewer&#x02019;s comment.</p><p>Response: Thank you very much. We have now modified the methods section according to the reviewer&#x02019;s comment. </p><p>Response to reviewer two</p><p>Dear reviewer, </p><p>Thank you very much for spending your precious time revising our manuscript and providing your valuable comments. The suggestions you made are important to improve our work. Accordingly, we have used all your comments and made changes to the revised copy of the manuscript. </p><p>1. Please, define the multilevel-Poison regression model in the methods section. Check the Multi-collinearity among the explanatory variables.</p><p>Response: Thank you very much again. We described multilevel-poison regression in the last paragraph of the statistical analysis section. Regarding the multi-collinearity, we have checked for the possible correlation between the predictor variables during the data analysis, and no correlations were detected among them. </p><p>Response to reviewer three</p><p>Dear reviewer, </p><p>Thank you very much for taking your valuable time to review our manuscript. We appreciate all your efforts to the improvement of our article. All the comments and suggestions you made were very relevant, and we accepted all of them and revised the manuscript's main document accordingly. Below, we explained all of your concerns in a point-by-point fashion as follows:</p><p>The study is well structured and provides important insights into the factors affecting child vaccination in different economic settings. However, there are a few areas where the authors can consider making improvements to enhance the clarity and relevance of their work.</p><p>1. Abstract clarity and precision: The abstract is a crucial section that provides a snapshot of the study&#x02019;s objectives, methods, results, and conclusions. In this case, the abstract seems to be a bit dense and could benefit from being more concise and precise. Focus on highlighting the main findings, methods, and implications of the study.</p><p>Response: We agree with your comment, and we have modified the abstract section making it more precise and focused accordingly.</p><p>2. Data Source Details: in the data source/extraction&#x0201d; section, consider providing more details about the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) database, such as its purpose, methodology, and coverage. This would help readers understand the source of the data better.</p><p>Response: thank you very much again. We have now included the purpose, methodology, and coverage of the DHS program in the data source/extraction section of the revised manuscript. </p><p>3. Equity Analysis Visualizations: The concentration curves and index values are important visualizations to illustrate wealth-based inequities. Consider including these visualizations in the main body of the paper (not just in the reviewer's comments) to help readers better understand the disparities.</p><p>Response: Including the illustrations/figures will indeed help the readers a lot to capture the information provided. We have included the concentration curve indicating the equity differences in full child vaccination; and an illustration of the concentration index of equity differences stratified by place of residence (urban-rural) in Figure 2, and 3 respectively, in wealth wealth-based inequality sub-section of the result section of the main manuscript. </p><p>4. Discussion: In the discussion section, consider placing the study's findings in the broader global context. How do the identified disparities and predictors align with trends observed in other low- and middle-income countries? Discuss any potential policy implications that could be generalized to other regions with similar contexts.</p><p>Response: We accepted your comment fully. We have now modified it by narrating the scenario with more other LMIC countries, and we have suggested the possible implication for action in paragraph four of the discussion section.</p><p>5. Limitations and Future Research: While you&#x02019;ve discussed the strength of the study, also include a section on limitations. Address any potential biases in the data, assumptions made during analysis, and any limitations of the chosen methodology. Suggest areas for future research, such as exploring other factors that might contribute to vaccination disparities.</p><p>Response: We appreciate the suggestion. In the revised copy of our manuscript, we have discussed the possible limitations of our study: the secondary nature of the data does not allow recruiting many variables of interest, recall bias might have been introduced and the possibilities of unseen variable bias also suggested areas for future researchers in the strength and limitation section of the revised manuscript. </p><p>6. Clarity and Flow: Proofread the manuscript to ensure smooth readability and clarity. Make sure that each section flows logically into the next and that the writing is concise and precise. </p><p>Response: Dear reviewer, thanks for your suggestion. We have proofread the whole manuscript and made necessary edits throughout the document.</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0293522.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response letter_PLOS ONE.pdf</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0293522.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0293522.r005" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0293522.r005</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 2</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hossain</surname><given-names>Md.
