Due to the high volume of online misinformation in recent years, there is a need to continue advancing methodologies in order to effectively identify narratives and themes. While machine learning models can be used to detect misinformation and conspiracies, these models are limited in their generalizability to other datasets and misinformation phenomenon, and are often unable to detect implicit meanings in text that require contextual knowledge. To rapidly detect evolving conspiracist narratives within high volume online discourse while identifying nuanced themes requiring the comprehension of subtext, this study describes a hybrid methodology that combines natural language processing (i.e., topic modeling and sentiment analysis) with qualitative content coding approaches to characterize conspiracy discourse related to 5G wireless technology and COVID-19 on Twitter (currently known as &#x02018;X&#x02019;). Discourse that focused on correcting 5G conspiracies was also analyzed for comparison. Sentiment analysis shows that conspiracy-related discourse was more likely to use language that was analytic, combative, past-oriented, referenced social status, and expressed negative emotions. Corrections discourse was more likely to use words reflecting cognitive processes, prosocial relations, health-related consequences, and future-oriented language. Inductive coding characterized conspiracist narratives related to global elites, anti-vax sentiment, medical authorities, religious figures, and false correlations between technology advancements and disease outbreaks. Further, the corrections discourse did not address many of the narratives prevalent in conspiracy conversations. This paper aims to further bridge the gap between computational and qualitative methodologies by demonstrating how both approaches can be used in tandem to emphasize the positive aspects of each methodology while minimizing their respective drawbacks.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="6"/><page-count count="29"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>The full dataset collected from Twitter and the top retweeted tweets selected for content coding can be found at the following link on the Open Science Framework (OSF): <ext-link xlink:href="https://bit.ly/5G_Conspiracies" ext-link-type="uri">https://bit.ly/5G_Conspiracies</ext-link> (DOI <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/YRNMX" ext-link-type="uri">10.17605/OSF.IO/YRNMX</ext-link>).

Introduction</title><sec id="sec002"><title>1.1 The emergence of infodemiology in the early internet era</title><p>Since the 2016 US presidential election, online misinformation spread had become a ubiquitous topic in public discourse with rising concerns related to the proliferation of &#x0201c;fake news&#x0201d; on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter before the election [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Public concern about misinformation spread has only grown since then, with the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring an &#x02018;infodemic&#x02019; in reaction to the proliferation of misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, risk related to online misinformation has existed since the early stages of the internet, as shown by the emergence of the field of infodemiology during that era [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295414.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Infodemiology, also known as &#x0201c;information epidemiology,&#x0201d; is the study of the determinants and distribution of health information and misinformation, and identifies areas where there is a knowledge translation gap between best available evidence and what most people do or believe, as well as markers for &#x0201c;high-quality&#x0201d; information [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295414.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Infodemiological frameworks make distinctions between supply-based applications, such as analyzing what is being published on web sites and social media, and demand-based methods that examine search and navigation behavior on the internet [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Applications of infodemiology include the analysis of queries from internet search engines to predict disease outbreaks [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], monitoring peoples&#x02019; health status updates on platforms such as Twitter and Weibo for syndromic surveillance [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], identifying prevalent themes and discourse around health conditions and behaviors (including COVID-19) [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295414.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295414.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and studies examining online mobilization of social media users to influence health policy outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295414.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>While social media platforms are an incredible tool for staying connected and communicating with others, they can also simultaneously be a source of uncertainty and fear, which are often accompanied by increased dissemination of unverified rumors, misinformation, and fringe or conspiracy theories [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295414.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To minimize the spread of misinformation, it is crucial to rapidly identify and then systematically sift through the high volume of posts and comments that often accompanies related online narratives, such as claims stating false ties between COVID-19 and 5G wireless technology. In response to this growing need for rapid content characterization, particularly in the context of health emergencies, supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches, such as natural language processing (NLP) and supervised learning trained on fact-checked data, have been used to identify and classify misinformation [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Additionally, large language models (LLM) have shown high accuracy scores for identifying misinformation [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295414.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], making popular models like chatGPT another promising tool for future infodemiological research. Despite the fact that various machine learning approaches are effective at classifying information and are crucial for adequately addressing the ongoing proliferation of misinformation that is overwhelming the social media ecosystem, these methods can be limited by their associated lexicon or dictionary and the semantic shifts that naturally occur in language over time and across contexts, including changing evidence about COVID-19 and other public health issues that may arise. Thus, for emerging issues that would not be recorded within training datasets, maintaining the use of human review and annotation remains necessary for properly detecting and contextualizing novel situations and narratives.</p><p>To gain a more thorough understanding of the nuanced patterns and dynamics underlying the spread of misinformation, our study introduces a hybrid analytic approach using metadata from 5G-COVID conspiracy discourse on Twitter (currently known as &#x02018;X&#x02019; but referred to as Twitter for this paper) aimed at leveraging both the efficiency of NLP techniques and the qualitative schema afforded by human coders. More specifically, this study used topic modeling and sentiment analysis to identify influential posts and characterize the discourse, and then used both inductive and deductive coding to detect context-specific narratives that would not be measured by standard sentiment dictionaries. While NLP and qualitative coding methods have been widely used throughout the literature for identifying and characterizing misinformation (see the following for examples: [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295414.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]), this paper combines these methods into a streamlined approach that can be utilized for rapidly characterizing nuanced themes and emerging narratives within large scale online discourses that requires significantly less burden on human annotation, as illustrated in the flow diagram in <bold><xref rid="pone.0295414.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref></bold>. The hybrid method utilized in this study also has the potential to generate nuanced training data for machine learning classifier models without the need for annotating thousands of posts.</p><p>This study aims to further bridge the gap between computational and qualitative methodologies by demonstrating how NLP and manual annotation can be used synergistically to emphasize the positive aspects of each approach while minimizing their respective drawbacks. In order to assess the utility of this methodology, themes generated by this approach will be compared for consistency with 5G-COVID conspiracy themes previously identified on Twitter [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], Facebook [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and Instagram [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Further, this study will extend the current literature by providing in-depth characterization of discourse focusing on correcting false information, which can be used to inform counterstrategies for online misinformation propagation.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>1.2 Using machine learning to detect misinformation</title><p>Even before the proliferation of misinformation spurred by the emergence of COVID-19, there have been several research efforts over the past decade demonstrating that machine learning approaches can be effective methods for detecting misinformation. Previous work has developed models with at least 70% accuracy for correctly classifying misinformation across multiple platforms and topics, including Twitter posts related to the zika virus [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295414.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], YouTube videos about prostate cancer [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and false health-related information on medical forum posts [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and Chinese posts on the platforms Weibo and WeChat [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Social media users can be classified as well, as shown by Ghenai and Mejova [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], who were able to identify with a 90% accuracy Twitter users prone to sharing false information promoting ineffective cancer treatments.</p><p>Many investigations using misinformation classifiers also examine the role of feature selection (i.e., what variables to include in the model) on prediction accuracy. While classifiers can effectively detect misinformation from only using textual features of the post, which are typically keywords associated with specific conspiracy theories or false narratives [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295414.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], the inclusion of variables accounting for properties of the post beyond the content of the specific message, such as emotional sentiment, has been shown to improve model performance across multiple studies [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295414.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295414.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Deriving sentiment features from posts only requires basic arithmetic, where sentiment scores are calculated by first counting the number of words associated with a sentiment category and then dividing that count by the total number of words within the post [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Each sentiment category includes a dictionary, which is the list of words selected to represent the category. Sentiment dictionaries can measure a wide array of topics, such as emotional affect states (e.g., anger, anxiety, joy), biological processes (e.g., health, death), cognitive processes (e.g., certainty, causation), time orientations (e.g., focus on past, present, or future), and linguistic properties (e.g., number of 1<sup>st</sup>-person pronouns used) [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>Assigning words to sentiment dictionaries can be accomplished using data-driven approaches, as shown by Stanford&#x02019;s Empath project that derived over 200 classification categories from analyzing more than 1.8 billion words of modern fiction [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. However, for online misinformation research, psychometrically validated sentiment dictionaries provided by the software Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) have been widely used for characterizing misinformation discourse [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295414.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and calculating sentiment features across multiple studies that evaluate performance of misinformation classifiers [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. A likely reason sentiment features are effective predictor variables is due to the fact that texts containing misinformation and conspiracies often have an emotional signature such as higher frequency of anger and anxiety words [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295414.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295414.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], although recent work indicates that emotional valence can vary depending on the type of misinformation being studied [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>Despite the demonstrated utility of machine learning approaches for static misinformation detection, sentiment analysis and misinformation classifiers are both limited in their ability to adapt to the ever-evolving nature of human language. That is, in the same way that Gestalt psychology demonstrates that the perception of a color shifts depending on what other colors surround it [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], the shades of meanings from words also shift based on the other words surrounding it within a sentence or paragraph. Since word meanings can change due to differences in context-use and language shifts throughout time, results from sentiment scores and classifier models may not always reflect the actual semantic meaning of texts. These limitations can be clearly depicted in other applications such as automated detection models for abusive language as demonstrated by Yin and Zubiaga [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], who show that these classifier models are limited in their generalizability for other abusive language datasets, and may over-rely on the appearance of keywords such as slurs and profanity. While slurs and profanity can be strong predictors of online abusive language, abuse can also be expressed using implicit meanings and subtext, which results in models that overlook abuse in posts not including slurs and profanity. It is also possible that a post containing profanity keywords is not abuse at all, such as instances of teasing between friends, yet a model would falsely label as abuse [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Due to the continually evolving nature of language and context-dependent meanings, detecting misinformation and conspiracies only using machine learning models faces similar semantic challenges.</p><p>Interpreting sentiment scores can be further complicated when accounting for the fact that the discussion topic can also influence the average emotional tone of a discourse. For example, discussions about a pandemic may have higher percentages of negative affect words (e.g., &#x0201c;death&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;tragedy&#x0201d;) compared to lighter conversation topics such as gardening. Hence, it is difficult to determine what is an appropriate threshold for meaningful sentiment scores across topics. While this limits what researchers can infer from these analyses, this study addresses this limitation by using a relativistic interpretation of sentiment scores. More specifically, discourse will be marked as high in a sentiment category based on whether it is in the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile of scores within the corpus. Using the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile as a threshold marker allows us to account for the specific context of the 5G discourse when making judgements for determining what comprises a high level of sentiment. This approach is also adaptable across a wide array of topics since percentiles indicate which cases are high or low for a given metric based on the sample distribution. To further illustrate this point, a post containing 5% of death-related words may be in the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile for discourse about gardening, making it a &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; amount, but be within the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile for pandemic-related discourse, making it a typical percentage within the context of that corpus. Additionally, this study incorporates a qualitative coding approach to account for contextual information that is typically overlooked in sentiment analysis but recognizable by a human coder.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>1.3 Inductive and deductive approaches for content coding</title><p>In recent years there have been calls for researchers to recognize the impact of contextualization when interpreting data, such as accounting for changes in semantics within a dataset over time [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. When identifying emerging narratives within online discourse, where meanings of text vary due to novel co-occurrences of words, the boundaries between noise and relevant signal are constantly shifting. Compared to supervised machine learning approaches, which requires an existing training dataset of annotated posts to be effective, human coders are more adaptable to updating their background knowledge of events, making them effective at recognizing text containing previously undocumented narratives. To account for contextualization factors, our study utilized both inductive and deductive analytic techniques to examine tweets related to conspiracy discourse stating a relationship between COVID-19 and 5G technology.</p><p>Based in grounded theory [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], <italic toggle="yes">inductive coding</italic> is an iterative data analytic process centered on constant examination and comparison, which allows for theory development and explicit coding procedures [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295414.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The primary benefits of an inductive approach is that it allows researchers to code texts using labels that are both aligned with the data and free from the influence of extant concepts, as well as detect tacit elements or connotations of the data that may not be apparent from a superficial reading of denotative content [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].

For the deductive coding scheme in the current study, we coded for whether posts contained misinformation or misinformation corrections based on whether it made statements claiming that 5G wireless technology causes COVID-19, or explicitly refuted the conspiracy. The criteria for classifying 5G-related misinformation and corrections were adapted from previous frameworks identifying COVID-related misinformation [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The researchers also coded for whether tweets expressed a positive, negative, or neutral stance towards 5G conspiracies. Coding for the user&#x02019;s stance makes it possible to trace and compare general sentiment across topics without having to account for specific themes.</p><p>By using both inductive and deductive coding schemes in our content analysis, we aimed to extract and interpret the underlying patterns of COVID-19 misinformation in a more comprehensive manner that are both consistent with the textual data and aligned with existing conceptual frameworks. This approach also allows us to track both general conceptual categories (e.g., misinformation) and more case-specific incidents (e.g., religious pastor claiming 5G causes COVID-19), or in other words, seeing both &#x0201c;the forest and the trees.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>1.4 Combining unsupervised machine learning and content analysis approaches</title><p>Previous studies that only use content analysis when investigating social media activity can require the coding of hundreds, if not thousands of posts, which can be an extensive cost in time and resources. Fortunately, unsupervised machine learning and NLP approaches have been used to aid in content analysis on social media, which includes the detection of illicit drug sales or promotions [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], self-report symptoms on social media [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], and identifying prominent themes in COVID-related misinformation [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. These approaches group posts together based on textual similarity, which can help filter out irrelevant topic clusters based on keywords [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], or organize the posts together to facilitate the identification of higher-level themes [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Since most social media discourse is driven by a small number of highly active users while the majority of users typically engage in passive behaviors such as browsing [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], characterizing discourse based on the most highly shared posts can be an effective approach for assessing public response to an issue due to most users not often generating their own content. This is further demonstrated in a recent study that conducted a social network analysis of Twitter users, which showed that the propagation of a COVID-related conspiracy theory was initiated by only a handful of prominent accounts during the early stages of the pandemic [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>].</p><p>Another advantage of applying topic modeling to social media data is that it allows for other prominent sub-themes to be identified from the topic clusters that might have been overlooked by just assessing a more general sampling of the most shared posts, such as the most retweeted tweets. This is demonstrated in previous work by the authors [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] who were able to identify themes related to the misuse of scientific authority within Twitter misinformation discourse after applying biterm topic modeling (BTM) to the data and then coding the top 10 retweeted tweets from each topic cluster. Using this approach, informally referred to as &#x0201c;BTM + 10,&#x0201d; we were able to build on themes identified in their previous characterization of misinformation discourse based on a more general sampling of the top 100 retweeted tweets [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. While BTM + 10 does not cover the content in every post assigned to a topic, the top 10 most retweeted tweets were able to account for at least 50% of the total tweet volume of each topic cluster within the context of the hydroxychloroquine twitter discourse [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], indicating that influential posts tend to account for a majority volume of tweets within a discourse. It is also worth noting that uncoded tweets are still assigned to a topic cluster based on textual similarity, which increases the likelihood that it would be similar in message content to the most influential posts that were assigned to the same cluster. Increasing the number of coded posts from the 10 most retweeted tweets to 15 or 20 can also account for greater tweet volume without adding substantial burden on the coders. In the current study, we wish to build on the BTM + 10 methodology as carried out in previous work [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] by incorporating sentiment analysis when characterizing 5G-COVID conspiracy discourse on Twitter.

Bruns et al. (2020) also identify prominent 5G conspiracy theories such as claims stating that 5G reduces the ability of the human body to absorb oxygen, and that 5G is related to a complex agenda involving bioengineered viruses and deadly 5G-activated vaccines led by elite figures such as Bill Gates, George Soros, the World Health Organization (WHO), and secret-society organizations like the Illuminati [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

Publicly available metadata from user account profiles were retrieved and coded to determine whether descriptions stated that they were a medical doctor or scientist, a religious leader, a government official, or affiliated with the media (e.g., a journalist, TV, or radio personality).</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>2.5 Calculating LIWC sentiment scores</title><p>Sentiment scores were calculated using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) and reflect the percentage of words within a post that correspond to a given sentiment category. The sentiment scores were calculated to assess language related to: Analytic thinking (metric of logical, formal thinking), Clout (language of leadership, status), Authenticity (perceived honesty, genuineness), and Netspeak (internet slang), cognitive-processes related to information evaluation (i.e., Causation, Discrepancy, Tentative, Certitude), Emotional Affect (i.e., Affect, Positive Tone, Negative Tone, Emotion, Positive emotion, Negative emotion, Anxiousness, Anger, Sadness), social- and health-related topics (i.e., Prosocial behavior, Interpersonal conflict, Moralization, Health, Illness, Death, and Risk), and time-related sentiments (i.e., Time, Past focus, Present focus, Future focus). Since some tweets receive a much greater proportion of engagement within a discourse than others, average sentiment scores for each topic cluster were also weighted based on number of retweets received. This allowed us to characterize emotional sentiment of a topic cluster based on the most influential posts, rather than by posts that received low exposure. Due to the lack of a normal distribution of sentiment scores, we applied a Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric approach and Dunn&#x02019;s post-hoc test to detect statistically significant differences across BTM topic clusters, with a Bonferroni Correction to account for multiple comparisons.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec013"><title>3 Results</title><sec id="sec014"><title>3.1 Content analysis and characterization</title><p>From the 256,562 tweets analyzed in this study, <xref rid="pone.0295414.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows all BTM topics generated and assessed. In this study, the majority of topics have at least 50% of their tweet volume composed of the top 10 tweets with highest volume of retweets, indicating that the top 10 retweets characterize a substantive volume of tweets assigned to each topic. There were 4 topics below 50%, with the lowest percentage being 40.9%. While this still accounts for a substantive percentage of tweet volume, it should be noted that there is more uncertainty associated with the characterizations based on the metrics derived from the top 10 most retweeted tweets for these topic clusters. Topics were further classified as high in misinformation or high in misinformation corrections if the topic had at least 33% of top 10 retweeted tweets associated with the respective categories. Topics were also labeled high in both (i.e., Mixed) if it contained at least 33% of misinformation and corrections, and low for the remaining topics. A threshold of 33% was chosen for this analysis since it indicates a substantive number of tweets for each topic. Out of the 20 topics in this study, 9 were classified as high in misinformation, 5 as high in misinformation corrections, 2 as high in both misinformation and corrections, and 4 as low in both. The topic clusters low in both were not chosen for further analysis.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0295414.t003"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0295414.t003</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>Properties of BTM clusters.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0295414.t003" id="pone.0295414.t003g" position="float"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" colspan="5" rowspan="1">

The results in <bold><xref rid="pone.0295414.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref></bold> show that themes were spread across topics, with sentiment varying across the discourse as well. While some topic clusters are predominately associated with one theme, as seen in topics 7, 8, 11, and 12, other topic clusters have multiple themes. The misinformation topic with the highest number of themes is topic 10, which includes themes of <italic toggle="yes">causative explanations</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">medical authorities</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">negative health effects</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">video</italic>. Within the correction discourse, <italic toggle="yes">medical authority</italic> was paired with themes related to <italic toggle="yes">5G towers on fire</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">causative explanations</italic> in topics 3 and 18. Among the topic clusters that were predominately misinformation, none of the correction tweets corresponded to any of the inductive coding themes. This suggests that misinformation discourses are closed off and less likely to have involvement from those providing corrections.

Among misinformation topics, the themes <italic toggle="yes">Huawei</italic> (33.5%), <italic toggle="yes">video</italic> (14.1%), and <italic toggle="yes">anti-vax</italic> (9.9%) were the three most prominent. The three most prevalent themes for corrections were <italic toggle="yes">medical authority</italic> (22.1%), <italic toggle="yes">causative explanations</italic> (10.3%), and <italic toggle="yes">celebrities</italic> (10.1%). The difference in prevalent themes further illustrates that the two conversations focused on differing conversation topics. Within misinformation discourse, the conspiracy theme <italic toggle="yes">Huawei</italic> claims that the UK government pulled out of a 5G contract due to concerns about it causing COVID, while the actual circumstance was due to concerns about surveillance from the Chinese government. In this case, a situation with a kernel of truth was misconstrued to perpetuate a false claim. The other themes <italic toggle="yes">video</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">anti-vax</italic> indicate conversations occurring off Twitter and plant the seed for future distrust in medical efforts. While the correction discourse made general refutations against the false correlation between 5G and COVID-19, it mostly did not address the specific narratives that were prominent in misinformation discourse, which could mitigate the effectiveness of the corrections. For mixed topic clusters, <italic toggle="yes">religious figures</italic> (29.8%), <italic toggle="yes">medical authority</italic> (20.8%), and <italic toggle="yes">geographic comparisons</italic> (9.9%) were the most common themes. It is possible that themes such as <italic toggle="yes">religious figures</italic> could be associated with conflicts between people&#x02019;s faith and public health guidelines, which may contribute to the high volume of both misinformation and corrections. It is also possible that the appearance of medical authorities both supporting and refuting claims that 5G causes COVID-19 could lead to ambiguity and confusion among users.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0295414.t005"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0295414.t005</object-id><label>Table 5</label><caption><title>Themes from inductive coding by misinformation classification.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0295414.t005" id="pone.0295414.t005g" position="float"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TOPIC</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CAUS EXP</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MED AUT</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PASTOR</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CELEB</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ANTI-VAX</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NEG HEALTH</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">VIDEO</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TECH CORRE</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HUAWEI</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">ELITE</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TOWER FIRE</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GEO</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr style="background-color:#F2F2F2"><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

Discussion</title><p>This study collected tweets related to 5G conspiracy theories and applied both NLP and qualitative content coding to characterize a large-scale online discourse. Sentiment analysis results show that misinformation and conspiracy discourse was more likely to use language that is analytic and references social status, death, conflict, and health. This discourse also scored higher in general emotion, negative emotion, and past-orientation. In contrast, discourse that challenged false information was more likely to use language related to cognitive processes, positive emotions, anger, prosocial tendencies, morality, illness, risk, and be future-oriented. These results reveal that correction topics, when compared to misinformation and conspiracy discourse, are more likely to use explanatory words related to causative arguments (e.g., &#x0201c;because&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;how&#x0201d;) and are more concerned with social relations and health-related consequences. The differences in temporal focus between discourses suggest that misinformation narratives evoke past events more often than corrections, whereas the future-oriented language of correction discourse could reflect concerns regarding health-related consequences to 5G-COVID conspiracy theories. These results also reveal that conspiracy-related discourse is more likely to use combative and negative emotional language, and mention extreme consequences more often than corrections (e.g., using death-related words vs illness-related words). The higher degree of negative and emotional language is consistent with previous studies that used sentiment analysis to examine 5G-COVID conspiracies [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295414.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], and provides additional insight into rhetorical strategies used in conspiratorial discourse. Further, these findings are consistent with work examining conspiracy spreaders on Twitter more generally, which found significant differences in negative emotion and death-related words compared to those who engage with scientific content [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>Results from the inductive coding themes were also detected in related work.

The consistency in findings shows the utility of the approach used in the current study, and reveals a pattern of uniformity in conspiracist narratives across social media platforms.</p><sec id="sec018"><title>4.1 Using topic modeling to identify discourse for further investigation</title><p>This hybrid approach uses topic modeling to identify influential posts within the corpus across multiple topic areas, making it possible to only need to code a small subset of the total volume of tweets in order to detect prominent themes and narratives within both conspiracy and correction discourses. Additionally, segmenting the discourse into topic clusters and then running sentiment analysis makes it possible to detect smaller subsets of tweets within the larger twitter conversation that are high in emotional affect. This can be useful for quickly identifying emotionally charged conversations that could be prioritized for content assessment from public officials or platforms. For instance, since discourse within misinformation topics 0, 6, and 13 are highest in negative emotion, anger and conflict sentiments, as seen in <bold><xref rid="pone.0295414.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref></bold>, these might be of relevance to those interested in tracking or preventing mobilization responses that lead to consequences in the physical world or lead to &#x0201c;offline harm&#x0201d; (such as deciding to burn down a cell tower). When assessing the inductive coding themes related to these topics, results show that themes concerning viral videos, negative health effects, and the Chinese technology company Huawei are associated with these sentiments. This could lead to follow-up analyses examining the users who lead these conversations, and can help prioritize which narratives within a conspiracy discourse might be most harmful to the public, especially in cases such as Huawei that could be linked to xenophobic attitudes towards Chinese and Asian Americans.</p><p>Another topic of interest is cluster 8, which is associated with the anti-vax theme and high in health and illness sentiments. Despite the timeframe of the study being late March to early April, where for those in the US and most English-speaking countries COVID-19 was still an emerging pandemic, it is surprising to encounter anti-vax sentiment towards the COVID-19 vaccine almost nine months before the announcement of the first approved vaccine. Topic 16, which has inductive coding themes related to causative explanations and medical authorities, and high in sentiment scores for <italic toggle="yes">Anxiousness</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Pro-social</italic> language, could also be of interest for those looking to identify persuasive strategies used by online conspiracy spreaders. In this discourse, the combination of credibility signifiers reflected in scientific terminology and pro-social language could make messages more persuasive to those seeking certainty and safety during an unknown health crisis or searching for more credible sources of information to fill an existing information gap.</p><p>It is also possible to track reactions to misinformation discourse by examining themes prominent in correction topics, where strategies using causative explanations and calls to medical authorities appear to be a common strategy used in corrections. However, the discourse from the corrections did not directly address many of the narratives prevalent in misinformation conversations (e.g., <italic toggle="yes">Huawei</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Anti-vax</italic>) with the most specific talking-points focusing on criticizing celebrities or religious leaders for spreading conspiracies as also detected by Honcharov et al. in a separate study examining anti-vaccination hashtags of public figures on Twitter [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Not addressing specific conspiracist narratives could tamper the effectiveness of correction strategies by not clarifying the information gaps that are capitalized on by misinformation spreaders, especially during times of uncertainty. This is particularly important in light of the findings from the affiliations analysis of the most retweeted users, which showed that media figures, medical scientists, and government officials were more likely to be involved in corrections discourse. Since these accounts are more likely to have higher perceived credibility and a greater reach in audience compared to the average user, it is important that emerging conspiracist narratives are identified early in order to design more effective counter-messaging strategies.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>4.2 Drawbacks of solely relying on machine learning approaches</title><p>Machine learning approaches for detecting misinformation (or classifying categories within online discourse more generally) have continued to evolve over the years. Recent efforts to improve accuracy of misinformation classifiers have found success using theoretical frameworks based on human information processing to guide feature selection [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], combining features from multiple modalities (i.e., text and visual) [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], and including features related to user response to post and message sources [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Multiple algorithms have also been evaluated, ranging from traditional logistic regression models and ensemble approaches such as voting and bagging classifiers [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] to advanced models using deep convolutional neural networks and knowledge graphs that use word embeddings instead of requiring feature selection [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295414.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>].</p><p>In response to the high accuracy of machine learning classifiers at detecting misinformation, there have been calls for action in recent years for researchers to make publicly available textual data with labeled fake news articles to build comprehensive training datasets for misinformation classification [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. These findings, in addition to the prominence of advanced LLMs such as chatGPT [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295414.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], make it tempting to infer that AI technologies can fully address the issue of large-scale content coding without the use of humans. However, as previously discussed, an important drawback of machine learning approaches is that they are generally limited to detecting fake news within specific contexts. Since misinformation topics and conspiracy theories are always evolving, NLP approaches are unable to generalize to novel situations that are not already documented. For example, classifiers developed in response to the misinformation proliferation surrounding the 2016 US presidential election would not be able to adequately detect COVID-related misinformation since the relevant keywords do not correspond across topics. Maintaining up-to-date classifier models would also be difficult to achieve during the COVID-19 pandemic, where scientific consensus and understanding of the virus have shifted multiple times from its early stages, and continues to evolve even over three years after its initial outbreak. It is also difficult for machine learning approaches to detect instances where outdated information or findings that were considered accurate at the time of publication are then used misleadingly in contemporary scenarios, such as in the case surrounding misinformation promoting the use of hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19 [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295414.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p><p>While building effective classifier models for 5G COVID conspiracies is possible during 2023 after being well documented, only human coders had the capability to accurately recognize text that contains these narratives when they first emerged online in 2020. We intended to address these limitations by demonstrating the general utility of a hybrid approach that incorporates human coders to take advantage of the efficiencies machine learning techniques provide researchers when working with big datasets while still accounting for contextual nuance from using qualitative approaches. Even though the definition of misinformation may vary in other discussions (e.g., politics, climate change, other social issues), the general principles of the methodology described could be leveraged to provide more up-to-date and richer contextual insights into how these conspiracy-related discourses evolve over time.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>4.3 Future directions in infodemiology</title><p>In order to properly make sense of findings generated from large scale communication networks, it is important that we also advance our conceptual understandings of information transmission dynamics. Other fields such as cognitive science and human-computer interactions (HCI) have developed frameworks for scientifically examining information as a phenomenon, which can be incorporated into future infodemiology research. One such theory is information foraging, which is based on ecological models of food scavenging behaviors where online users are considered &#x0201c;foragers&#x0201d; who balance the value gained from finding new information with the time cost needed to obtain it [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. The types of analyses conducted using an information foraging framework include the following: information patch models that assess engagement activities in environments where information is encountered in clusters (e.g., webpages), information scent models that assess how information value is evaluated from proximal cues (e.g., titles and images on a website), and information diet models that examine decisions concerning the selection and pursuit of information items [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Future infodemiological work can design behavioral experiments using information scent models to test how cues on sites or social media posts influence safety perceptions of potentially dangerous transactions such as illicit drug purchasing, and adapt information diet models to examine how users evaluate the truthfulness of health-claims across online environments.</p><p>Another relevant theoretical framework is distributed cognition, which extends human intelligence beyond the boundaries of individual actors to encompass interactions between people and resources within the environment [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. According to this framework, social organization determines the way information flows through groups [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>], and more recent work emphasizes the ways cognition is distributed over a vast array of social, institutional, political, and technological systems that are shaped by, and shape, the individuals who develop and operate within them [<xref rid="pone.0295414.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295414.ref102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Within the context of social media environments, where topics of discourse are constantly shifting and information is transmitted from a wide array of sources including other users, celebrities, institutions, and political figures, this framework can make sense of how narratives evolve by examining the interplay between the broadcaster of a message and their audiences&#x02019; reaction, engagement, and retransmission of that message. The theory of distributed cognition can also guide research questions that distinguish between message transmission due to an individual&#x02019;s personal beliefs and propagation driven by conformity to other users. Overall, both information foraging and distributed cognition frameworks can be adapted in future work to generate deeper insights concerning health-related information seeking behaviors, enrich interpretations from social network analysis, and guide the design of interventions targeting misinformation propagation.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>4.4 Limitations</title><p>Content coding took place several months after the initial timeframe of the study. While having the time gap allowed us to assess which accounts were deleted or suspended since the initial 5G discourse, we were unable to code for affiliations of those deleted users using publicly available profile data. As stated in the methods section, the top 10 retweeted tweets do not account for every tweet associated within a topic cluster. While the most retweeted tweets account for a substantive proportion of the topic cluster&#x02019;s tweet volume, and in most cases a majority, there is still some level of uncertainty when characterizing the discourse even if the uncoded tweets share textual similarity to the coded posts. Additional measures such as the use of sentiment analysis, which in this study was applied to the full topic clusters, can also mitigate these concerns since they account for information provided in the uncoded tweets. Finally, though false information can be categorized as &#x0201c;misinformation,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;disinformation,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;mal-information,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;conspiracy&#x0201d; based on intent and content, this study did not differentiate between these categories, opting to call all false information, regardless of intent, &#x0201c;misinformation.&#x0201d; This lack of differentiation limits the study&#x02019;s ability to identify potential differences in rhetoric associated with the nuances of false information dissemination.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec022"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>The advancement of communication technologies and the continued emergence of new social media platforms present difficult challenges for researchers looking to investigate the highly dynamic information ecosystem of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Fortunately, these same rapid advancements in technology can also be harnessed by researchers as powerful tools to navigate these complex environments. However, as demonstrated in the current paper, the human perspective is equally crucial in this line of work to compensate for the shortcomings that artificial intelligences have toward understanding human endeavors. Due to the rapid pace of modern discourse, words that can be key identifiers for a dangerous conspiracy in one context can be completely irrelevant in a different grouping of text. Within these online conversations, where the boundary between signal and noise is constantly shifting due to emerging and continually evolving narratives, it is crucial to recruit the signal detection capabilities of both machine learning models and human beings to adequately address current and future misinformation challenges now endemic in our global information society.</p></sec><sec id="sec023" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0295414.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>STROBE statement&#x02014;Checklist of items that should be included in reports of observational studies.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0295414.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0295414.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Hybrid approach for characterizing social media discourse using machine learning and qualitative methodologies.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0295414.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0295414.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Most retweeted accounts associated with each BTM cluster.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0295414.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank our collaborators in the Cognitive Media Lab at UC San Diego (<ext-link xlink:href="http://cognitivemedialab.ucsd.edu" ext-link-type="uri">cognitivemedialab.ucsd.edu</ext-link>) for the productive discussions about online conspiracy discourse that helped inform the current manuscript.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0295414.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Allcott</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gentzkow</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>. <article-title>Social Media and Fake News in the 2016 Election.</article-title>

Its well-written manuscript uses appropriate grammar, spelling, punctuation, and vocabulary to convey the author's ideas effectively. It also follows a logical structure that enables readers to follow the flow of ideas easily.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;1. Summary of research and overall impression</p><p>The manuscript is a well written study of misinformation recognized in online platforms such as Twitter. It takes a thorough view of various approaches to misinformation detection and classification and also examines the societal need for this activity, a field termed as Infodemiology in the health context.</p><p>2. Major Issues</p><p>The work has some excessively wide-ranging phrases and general statements, for example, ``Since science itself is an iterative process..." which result in a slightly long manuscript and could be pruned. Moreover, such statements are not strictly necessary, apparently.</p><p>Minor Issues</p><p>Details such as the specific script/algorithm used for analysis in each Table could be presented in Supplementary Data or in an Appendix to make the work more replicable by the readership.</p><p>As an additional point, as the manuscript is long, adding a `table of contents' type element right at the start might be useful for the reader to get a bird's-eye view of all the sections and subsections; but journal format guidelines have the last word on this.</p><p>3. Overall Feedback</p><p>The work is well referenced and the presentation conveys the impression of thoroughness.</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#x000a0;This is an excellent study and manuscript describing the use of a hybrid method for detecting conspiracy tweets linking 5G technology to COVID-19. I especially appreciated the authors&#x02019; suggested applications of their findings in the Discussion. A few points are provided below for the authors to consider.</p><p>&#x02022; The Introduction provides an excellent and erudite background on infodemiology and content coding. It is longer than is standard, but perhaps worth keeping given the broad audience of PLOS One.</p><p>&#x02022; Given the large amount of information scientists encounter daily, many will only see the abstract of this study. It is therefore important to include some findings or results in the abstract. I urge the authors to add at least two sentences describing the outcome of their analysis of tweets linking 5G to COVID-19; several of the background sentences can be omitted, if needed, to accommodate the word limit. Even though the authors position the study as a showcase for their methods, it seems important to demonstrate the novel insights that the method provides. Similarly, the authors state that &#x0201c;this study showcases . . . .&#x0201d; in the abstract, without describing the study. These changes will help rectify the current feel of over-promoting the method instead of letting the data/outcomes speak for itself/themselves.</p><p>&#x02022; COVID-19 or coronavirus should be listed as a keyword, as it does not appear in the abstract or title.

My understanding is that this study summarized the topic and linguistic characteristics of 5G-related conspiracies on Twitter using topic modeling, LIWC, and manual content analysis. First, it is not about detection. The paper did not present any algorithms or computations that could be used to detect falsehoods in the future.

In response to reviewer&#x02019;s suggestions and those of other reviewers, we have edited the Introduction to maintain the main points in the previous version while trimming excess statements and rephrasing the language in order to make it clearer and more concise when possible. Changes are numerous, please see highlighted changes in the revised manuscript submitted.</p><p>&#x02022; Given the large amount of information scientists encounter daily, many will only see the abstract of this study. It is therefore important to include some findings or results in the abstract. I urge the authors to add at least two sentences describing the outcome of their analysis of tweets linking 5G to COVID-19; several of the background sentences can be omitted, if needed, to accommodate the word limit. Even though the authors position the study as a showcase for their methods, it seems important to demonstrate the novel insights that the method provides. Similarly, the authors state that &#x0201c;this study showcases . . . .&#x0201d; in the abstract, without describing the study. These changes will help rectify the current feel of over-promoting the method instead of letting the data/outcomes speak for itself/themselves.</p><p>Author Response: Thank you for your important comment about featuring our results within the abstract. In response we have included in the abstract the major results from the study, including sentiment analysis and inductive coding in order to make the insights generated from our approach more explicit. We have also edited the abstract to remove any language that might be interpreted as self-promoting, such as the language suggested by reviewer. See revised abstract below:</p><p>Abstract</p><p>The spread of misinformation and conspiracies has been an ongoing issue since the early stages of the internet era, resulting in the emergence of the field of infodemiology (i.e., information epidemiology) which investigates the transmission of health-related information. Due to the high volume of online misinformation in recent years, there is a need to continue advancing methodologies in order to effectively identify narratives and themes. While machine learning models can be used to detect misinformation and conspiracies, these models are limited in their generalizability to other datasets and misinformation phenomenon, and are often unable to detect implicit meanings in text that require contextual knowledge. In order to rapidly detect evolving conspiracist narratives within high volume online discourse while identifying nuanced themes requiring the comprehension of subtext, this study describes a hybrid methodology that combines natural language processing (i.e., topic modeling and sentiment analysis) with qualitative content coding approaches to examine conspiracy discourse related to 5G wireless technology and COVID-19 on Twitter (currently known as &#x02018;X&#x02019;). Discourse that focused on correcting 5G conspiracies was also analyzed for comparison. Sentiment analysis shows that conspiracy-related discourse was more likely to use language that was analytic, reference social status, combative, expressed negative emotions, and be past-oriented. Corrections discourse was more likely to use words reflecting cognitive processes, prosocial relations, health-related consequences, and future-oriented language. Inductive coding identified conspiracist narratives related to global elites, anti-vax sentiment, medical authorities, religious figures, and false correlations between technology advancements and disease outbreaks. Further, the corrections discourse did not address many of the narratives prevalent in conspiracy conversations. This paper aims to further bridge the gap between computational and qualitative methodologies by demonstrating how both approaches can be used in tandem to emphasize the positive aspects of each methodology while minimizing their respective drawbacks. </p><p>&#x02022; COVID-19 or coronavirus should be listed as a keyword, as it does not appear in the abstract or title. Consider added 5G as a keyword also, although that does appear in the abstract.</p><p>Author Response: Thank you for your suggestion concerning our keywords. In response we have now added the terms &#x02018;COVID-19&#x02019; and &#x02018;5G&#x02019;. </p><p>&#x02022; A description of the units shown should be added to each graph or in the figure captions.

In response we have edited the language so that it focuses back on the advantages of using the approach featured in the manuscript and deleted the last sentence as suggested. See revised language below:</p><p>5. Conclusion</p><p>The advancement of communication technologies and the continued emergence of new social media platforms present difficult challenges for researchers looking to investigate the highly dynamic information ecosystem of the 21st century. Fortunately, these same rapid advancements in technology can also be harnessed by researchers as powerful tools to navigate these complex environments. However, as demonstrated in the current paper, the human perspective is equally crucial in this line of work to compensate for the shortcomings that artificial intelligences have towards understanding human endeavors. Due to the rapid pace of modern discourse, words that can be key identifiers for a dangerous conspiracy in one context can be completely irrelevant in a different grouping of text. Within these online conversations, where the boundary between signal and noise is constantly shifting due to emerging and continually evolving narratives, it is crucial to recruit the signal detection capabilities of both machine learning models and human beings to adequately address current and future misinformation challenges now endemic in our global information society. p41, &#x000b6;2 </p><p>REVIEWER #4</p><p>This study investigated conspiracy discourse related to 5G wireless technology by using a combination of NLP (i.e., topic modeling and sentiment analysis) and qualitative content analysis.</p><p>1.

The first paragraph concludes with a call to advance methodologies that address the ongoing proliferation of misinformation that is overwhelming the social media ecosystem. I got a little lost here. This conclusion seems disconnected from the main reasoning of this paragraph. Why can't the aforementioned infodemiology applications address the current problems? What areas in particular need to be advanced?</p><p>Author Response: Thank you for your feedback concerning the language used in the introduction. Our intent was to preview further discussion of the potential need to examine new methodologies to address misinformation within the field of infodemiology and not to specifically critique prior work. In response we deleted the last sentence of the first paragraph, edited the first paragraph for greater clarity, and restructured the introduction more generally to better contextualize prior infodemiology and machine learning approaches to the misinformation challenge, while also providing more rationale of why new methodologies also warrant further study. Changes are numerous, please see our revised Introduction section in the revised manuscript. </p><p>3. The authors should clearly distinguish between misinformation and conspiracies. They are two distinct concepts, but the authors used them interchangeably throughout the manuscript.</p><p>Author Response: Thank you for your comment about distinguishing between misinformation and conspiracies. We have edited the manuscript in the introduction and discussion to include the phrase &#x0201c;misinformation and conspiracies&#x0201d; when referring to discourse containing false information. For our analysis we have continued to just refer to this discourse as misinformation, however, we included language in the methods to explicitly state that we&#x02019;re using the term misinformation to refer to both concepts for brevity and have also included additional language in the revised Limitations section clearly stating the limitations of this coding approach. See additional explanation below:</p><p>2.3 Deductive and Inductive Coding Schemes</p><p>In order to characterize highly prevalent misinformation and conspiratorial narratives in the corpus, the top 10 most retweeted tweets from all 20 BTM topic outputs were extracted and manually coded for relevance first using a deductive coding scheme adapted from existing COVID-19 misinformation themes from the literature (Haupt et al., 2021a; Islam et al., 2020), and then coded again using an inductive approach identifying context specific themes related to 5G. While misinformation and conspiracies are distinct concepts, the current study will refer to both as &#x02018;misinformation&#x02019; within the analysis for brevity. p17, &#x000b6;1</p><p>&#x02026;</p><p>4.4. Limitations</p><p>Content coding took place several months after the initial timeframe of the study. While having the time gap allowed us to assess which accounts were deleted or suspended since the initial 5G discourse, we were unable to code for affiliations of those deleted users using publicly available profile data. As stated in the methods section, the top 10 retweeted tweets do not account for every tweet associated within a topic cluster. While the most retweeted tweets account for a substantive proportion of the topic cluster&#x02019;s tweet volume, and in most cases a majority, there is still some level of uncertainty when characterizing the discourse even if the uncoded tweets share textual similarity to the coded posts. Additional measures such as the use of sentiment analysis, which in this study was applied to the full topic clusters, can also mitigate these concerns since they account for information provided in the uncoded tweets. Finally, though false information can be categorized as &#x0201c;misinformation,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;disinformation,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;mal-information&#x0201d;, and some information can also be classified as &#x0201c;conspiracy&#x0201d; based on intent and content, this study did not differentiate between these categories, opting to call all false information, regardless of intent, &#x0201c;misinformation.&#x0201d; This lack of differentiation limits internal reliability and the study&#x02019;s ability to identify potential differences in rhetoric associated with the nuances of false information dissemination. p40, &#x000b6;2</p><p>4. I have some concerns over the generalizability of the current study. The NLP of this study generally evolves around the 5G-COVID conspiracy. How could the findings be generalized to misinformation detection in other disciplines, say politics, climate change, etc.?</p><p>Author Response: Thank you for your feedback concerning the generalizability of the NLP methods showed in the current study. In response we have added additional language discussing how our approach can be adapted for other topics. We have also included a flow chart diagram in the appendix (Figure A1) to further illustrate how our approach can be adapted for analyzing other discourse topics besides 5G conspiracies. We have also clarified that the Discussion section of the study that results are not necessarily generalizable to misinformation discourse on other pressing social and health topics, but that the general methodological approach could be leveraged in a similar fashion to provide more contextual classification to misinformation specific to these topics. See revised language below: </p><p>Interpreting sentiment scores can be further complicated when accounting for the fact that the discussion topic can also influence the average emotional tone of a discourse. For example, discussions about a pandemic may have higher percentages of negative affect words (e.g., &#x0201c;death&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;tragedy&#x0201d;) compared to lighter conversation topics such as gardening. For this reason it is difficult to determine what is an appropriate threshold for meaningful sentiment scores across topics. While this can limit what researchers can infer from these analyses, this study addresses this limitation by using a relativistic interpretation of sentiment scores. More specifically, discourse will be marked as high in a sentiment category based on whether it is in the 90th percentile of scores within the corpus. Using the 90th percentile as a threshold marker allows us to account for the specific context of the 5G discourse when making judgements for determining what is a high level of sentiment. This approach is also adaptable across a wide array of topics since percentiles indicate which cases are high and low for a given metric based on the sample distribution. To further illustrate this point, a post containing 5% of death-related words may be in the 95th percentile for discourse about gardening, making it a &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; amount, but be within the 50th percentile for pandemic-related discourse, making it a typical percentage within the context of that corpus. Additionally, this study incorporates a qualitative coding approach to account for contextual information that is typically overlooked in sentiment analysis but can be recognized by a human coder. p8, &#x000b6;2</p><p>&#x02026;</p><p>While building effective classifier models for 5G COVID conspiracies is possible during 2023 after being well documented, only human coders had the capability to accurately recognize text that contains these narratives when they first emerged online in 2020. We intended to address these limitations by demonstrating the general utility of a hybrid approach that incorporates human coders to take advantage of the efficiencies machine learning techniques provide researchers when working with big datasets while still accounting for contextual nuance from using qualitative approaches. Even though the definition of misinformation may vary in other discussions (e.g., politics, climate change, other social issues), the general principles of the methodology described could be leveraged to provide more up-to-date and richer contextual insights into how these conspiracy-related discourses evolve over time p38, &#x000b6;2</p><p>5. Please elaborate on the relativistic approach: define it and justify its use in the current context.</p><p>Author Response: Thank you for your comment about expanding on the relativistic approach mentioned in our study. We have included additional language to the manuscript to further define this approach as well as including examples for how this approach can be adapted for other discourses.</p><p>Interpreting sentiment scores can be further complicated when accounting for the fact that the discussion topic can also influence the average emotional tone of a discourse. For example, discussions about a pandemic may have higher percentages of negative affect words (e.g., &#x0201c;death&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;tragedy&#x0201d;) compared to lighter conversation topics such as gardening. For this reason it is difficult to determine what is an appropriate threshold for meaningful sentiment scores across topics. While this can limit what researchers can infer from these analyses, this study addresses this limitation by using a relativistic interpretation of sentiment scores. More specifically, discourse will be marked as high in a sentiment category based on whether it is in the 90th percentile of scores within the corpus. Using the 90th percentile as a threshold marker allows us to account for the specific context of the 5G discourse when making judgements for determining what is a high level of sentiment. This approach is also adaptable across a wide array of topics since percentiles indicate which cases are high and low for a given metric based on the sample distribution. To further illustrate this point, a post containing 5% of death-related words may be in the 95th percentile for discourse about gardening, making it a &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; amount, but be within the 50th percentile for pandemic-related discourse, making it a typical percentage within the context of that corpus. Additionally, this study incorporates a qualitative coding approach to account for contextual information that is typically overlooked in sentiment analysis but can be recognized by a human coder. p8, &#x000b6;2</p><p>6. The first paragraph on page 9 appears disjointed as it initially discusses three modes of data interpretation, then transitions to discussing inductive and deductive analysis. It would be beneficial to establish a coherent connection between these two sets of approaches to ensure the flow of ideas and the logical progression of the argument.</p><p>Author Response: Thank you for your comment about the modes of data interpretation discussed in the manuscript. Our initial intent when discussing these modes were to further illustrate the advantages of human coders when interpreting data, however, we realize that this could be interpreted as introducing a formal coding approach for analysis. In order to make this clearer, we have edited the language in this paragraph to more explicitly emphasize the utility of human coders when identifying emerging narratives compared to machine learning approaches. </p><p>1.3 Inductive and Deductive approaches for content coding</p><p>In recent years there have been calls for researchers to recognize the impact of contextualization when interpreting data, such as accounting for changes in semantics within a dataset over time (Poirier, 2021). When identifying emerging narratives within online discourse, where meanings of text vary due to novel co-occurrences of words, the boundaries between noise and relevant signal are constantly shifting. Compared to machine learning approaches, which requires an existing training dataset of annotated posts to be effective, human coders are more adaptable at updating their background knowledge of events, making them effective at recognizing text containing previously undocumented narratives. To account for contextualization factors, our study utilized both inductive and deductive analytic techniques to examine tweets related to conspiracy discourse that states a relationship between COVID-19 and 5G technology. p9, &#x000b6;1</p><p>7. I guess most of the audience of this paper should get some foundational knowledge, like what inductive and deductive coding are, as well as their pros and cons. So the authors could cut this part.</p><p>Author Response: Thank you for your comment about the inductive and deductive coding sections of our manuscript. We have edited the language in these sections to make these sections more concise while still providing a description of these approaches. </p><p>Based in grounded theory (Glaser and Strauss, 1967), inductive coding is an iterative data analytic process centered on constant examination and comparison, which allows for theory development and explicit coding procedures (Corbin and Strauss, 1990; Boyatzis 1998). The primary benefits of an inductive approach is that it allows researchers to code texts using labels that are both aligned with the data and free from the influence of extant concepts, and detect tacit elements or connotations of the data that may not be apparent from a superficial reading of denotative content (Suddaby, 2006). For the current study, inductive coding was used to identify narratives and rumors prominent within the 5G discourse. </p><p>Deductive coding, on the other hand, refers to a top-down coding process intended on testing whether data coincide with existing assumptions, theories, or hypotheses (Fereday &#x00026; Muir-Cochrane, 2006). For the deductive coding scheme in the current study, we coded for whether posts contained misinformation or misinformation corrections based on whether it made statements claiming that 5G wireless technology causes COVID-19, or actively refutes the conspiracy. The criteria for classifying 5G-related misinformation and corrections was adapted from previous frameworks identifying COVID-related misinformation (Haupt et al., 2021a; Islam et al., 2020; Mackey et al., 2021). The researchers also coded for whether tweets expressed a positive, negative, or neutral stance towards 5G conspiracies. Coding for the user&#x02019;s stance makes it possible to trace and compare general sentiment across topics without having to account for specific themes. p9, &#x000b6;2-3</p><p>8. Deductive coding is a coding process intended to test whether data coincides with existing assumptions, theories, or hypotheses. I agree with that. But I don&#x02019;t see any assumptions or hypotheses that the authors sought to test.</p><p>Author Response: Thank you for your comment about clarifying the existing assumptions and theories associated with our deductive coding approach. We have edited this section to make our coding criteria clearer as well as made it more explicit that we adapted existing frameworks for defining misinformation from previous COVID-related studies.</p><p>Deductive coding, on the other hand, refers to a top-down coding process intended on testing whether data coincide with existing assumptions, theories, or hypotheses (Fereday &#x00026; Muir-Cochrane, 2006). For the deductive coding scheme in the current study, we coded for whether posts contained misinformation or misinformation corrections based on whether it made statements claiming that 5G wireless technology causes COVID-19, or actively refutes the conspiracy.

My understanding is that this study summarized the topic and linguistic characteristics of 5G-related conspiracies on Twitter using topic modeling, LIWC, and manual content analysis. First, it is not about detection. The paper did not present any algorithms or computations that could be used to detect falsehoods in the future. Second, these methods are not quite new (see below)</p><p>Rashkin, H., Choi, E., Jang, J. Y., Volkova, S., &#x00026; Choi, Y. (2017, September).

In response we have added additional language to our introduction to clarify that we are incorporating existing methodologies into a streamlined approach in order to conduct more in-depth characterization (versus &#x0201c;identification&#x0201d;) of emerging narratives in online discourse and have made this distinction consistent throughout the manuscript. We have also included the above mentioned references as examples of work that use these methods. We also clarify that by &#x0201c;detection&#x0201d;, this word can refer to a recognition process that is accessible to both humans and machine learning classifier models. This is further illustrated by the fact that the word &#x0201c;detect&#x0201d; has existed long before machine learning techniques were prevalent. Further, we emphasize that the approach described in this study can be used to streamline annotation of posts to develop relevant training datasets, which is a crucial step that needs to be taken before it&#x02019;s possible to develop effective classifier models for future conspiracy discourse. Changes are numerous, please find some of the main changes addressing this comment below:</p><p>To gain a more thorough understanding of the nuanced patterns and dynamics underlying the spread of misinformation, our study introduces a hybrid analytic approach using metadata from 5G-COVID conspiracy discourse on Twitter (currently known as &#x02018;X&#x02019; but referred to as Twitter for this paper) aimed at leveraging both the efficiency of NLP techniques and the qualitative schema afforded by human coders. More specifically, this study used topic modeling and sentiment analysis to identify influential posts and characterize the discourse, and then used both inductive and deductive coding to detect context-specific narratives that would not be measured by standard sentiment dictionaries. While NLP and qualitative coding methods have been widely used throughout the literature for identifying and characterizing misinformation (see the following for examples: Haupt et al., 2021a; Rashkin et al., 2017; Massey et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2021), this paper combines these methods into a streamlined approach that can be utilized for rapidly characterizing nuanced themes and emerging narratives within large scale online discourses that requires significantly less burden on human annotation, as illustrated in the flow diagram in S1 Appendix. The hybrid method utilized in this study also has the potential to generate nuanced training data for machine learning classifier models without the need for annotating thousands of posts.</p><p>This study aims to further bridge the gap between computational and qualitative methodologies by demonstrating how NLP and manual annotation can be used synergistically to emphasize the positive aspects of each approach while minimizing their respective drawbacks. In order to assess the utility of this methodology, themes generated by this approach will be compared for consistency with 5G-COVID conspiracy themes previously identified on Twitter (Ahmed et al., 2020; Flaherty et al., 2022; Langguth et al., 2022), Facebook (Bruns et al., 2020), and Instagram (Quinn et al., 2021). Further, this study will extend the current literature by providing in-depth characterization of discourse focusing on correcting false information, which can be used to inform counter strategies for online misinformation propagation p4-5</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0295414.s004" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">R1 Response Letter 5G submit.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0295414.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0295414.r003" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0295414.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cresci</surname><given-names>Stefano</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2023 Stefano Cresci</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2023</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Stefano Cresci</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0295414" id="rel-obj003" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
