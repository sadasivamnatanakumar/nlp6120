Glut1, the major vertebrate glucose transporter, has been shown to be the HTLV Env receptor. While it is well established that the extracellular surface component (SU) of the HTLV envelope glycoprotein (Env) harbors all of the determinants of interaction with the receptor, identification of SU subdomains that are necessary and sufficient for interaction with the receptor, as well as critical amino acids therein, remain to be precisely defined. Although highly divergent in the rest of their genomes, HTLV and murine leukemia virus (MLV) Env appear to be related and based on homologous motifs between the HTLV and MLV SU, we derived chimeric HTLV/MLV Env and soluble HTLV-1 and -2 truncated amino terminal SU subdomains.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using these SU constructs, we found that the 183 and 178 amino terminal residues of the HTLV-1 and -2 Env, respectively, were sufficient to efficiently bind target cells of different species. Binding resulted from <italic>bona fide </italic>interaction with the HTLV receptor as isolated SU subdomains specifically interfered with HTLV Env-mediated binding, cell fusion, and cell-free as well as cell-to-cell infection. Therefore, the HTLV receptor-binding domain (RBD) lies in the amino terminus of the SU, immediately upstream of a central immunodominant proline rich region (Env residues 180 to 205), that we show to be dispensible for receptor-binding and interference. Moreover, we identified a highly conserved tyrosine residue at position 114 of HTLV-1 Env, Tyr<sub>114</sub>, as critical for receptor-binding and subsequent interference to cell-to-cell fusion and infection. Finally, we observed that residues in the vicinity of Tyr<sub>114 </sub>have lesser impact on receptor binding and had various efficiency in interference to post-binding events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The first 160 residues of the HTLV-1 and -2 mature cleaved SU fold as autonomous domains that contain all the determinants required for binding the HTLV receptor.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) has been found primarily in CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], whereas CD8+ T-lymphocytes are thought to be the <italic>in vivo </italic>reservoir of HTLV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, the <italic>in vitro </italic>tropism of HTLV-1 and -2, as determined using HTLV envelope-pseudotyped virions or envelope-induced cell fusion assays, appears to be ubiquitous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Indeed, we recently showed that Glut1, the ubiquitous vertebrate glucose transporter, serves as a receptor for HTLV-1 and -2 envelope glycoprotein (Env) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. While the precise organization and properties of the receptor-interacting Env domains has not been reported, we found that the amino terminal two-thirds of the HTLV-1 extracellular surface component (SU) are sufficient to confer HTLV-1 tropism to an ecotropic Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MLV) Env [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. A cell fusion interference assay performed with this HTLV/F-MLV Env chimera and the parental Env confirmed that this 215 amino acid Env domain, harbors HTLV-1 receptor-binding determinants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The corresponding domain in MLV Env SU &#x02013; located upstream of a conserved K/R L L T/N L V Q motif in the SU of the HTLV-1 and F-MLV Env [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] &#x02013; is well characterized and comprises two main functional regions: an amino terminal sequence harboring the receptor-binding determinants, VRA, VRB and VRC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and a proline-rich region (PRR), starting at the first proline residue of the GPRVPIGP sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and flanked by two highly conserved GXDP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and CXXC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] motifs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In the ecotropic and amphotropic (Ampho) MLV Env, the PRR is a putative hinge region implicated in conformational changes, triggered after receptor binding, and subsequent fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In the central region of the HTLV SU, a short sequence (Env residues 180 to 205) harbors high proline content and could be a homologue of the MLV PRR.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Homologous modular domains in HTLV and MLV envelopes. </bold>Friend-MLV (F-MLV) Env and HTLV-1 Env are schematically represented as open and solid boxes, respectively. Boxes represent, from left to right, the signal peptide which comprises the first 34 and 20 amino acid residues of F-MLV and HTLV Env, respectively, the extracellular surface component (SU) and the transmembrane component (TM) including the carboxy terminal R peptide in F-MLV, which is cleaved in the mature Env glycoprotein [64, 65]. Env landmark positions are indicated and the MLV proline-rich regions (PRR) and the HTLV SU PRR homologue (PRRH) are delineated by vertical lines within the SU at the positions indicated by solid arrowheads. The PRR and PRRH start at the first proline (P) residue downstream of the conserved GXDP motif. Env sequences represented in the figure are obtained from F-MLV strain 57 (accession number CAA26561); P-MLV, F-MCF polytropic MLV (AAA46483); X-MLV, NZB xenotropic MLV (AAA46531); A-MLV, amphotropic MLV strain 4070A (AAA46515); HTLV-2 (NP_041006); and HTLV-1, MT2 strain (VCLJMT). Residue numbering starts from the first methionine of the Env signal peptides. Proline residues and homologous motifs are noted in bold. Amino acid sequence alignments were performed using the Clustal program in the Megalign alignment software package (DNAStar) with manual adjustments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1742-4690-1-41-1"/></fig><p>Several studies using synthetic peptides and neutralizing antibodies against the HTLV Env have shown that determinants within this proline rich region homologue (PRRH) are involved in interference to Env-mediated syncytium formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The PRRH had been thought to encode the receptor-binding domain, as based on cell-to-cell fusion assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, although PRRH synthetic peptides can block HTLV Env-mediated syncytia formation, they have no effect on HTLV SU binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Indeed, we and others have shown that Env receptor binding <italic>per se</italic>, as well as interference to receptor-binding, cell-to-cell fusion, syncytium formation, and infection involve several distinct cell surface-associated parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In the present report, we produced soluble forms of wild-type and mutant HTLV-1 and 2 SU amino terminal subdomains and tested their receptor-binding abilities. We also tested their ability to specifically interfere with HTLV Env cell surface binding, Env-mediated cell-to-cell fusion, and retroviral infection. By testing these essential parameters of Env-mediated dissemination, we delineated the Env receptor-binding domain (RBD) to the first 160 residues of the mature HTLV-1 and -2 SU, excluding the PRRH, and we identified a conserved tyrosine residue at position 114 of HTLV-1 Env as a critical determinant for HTLV Env receptor binding.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Motif conservation and similar modular organization of HTLV and MLV SU, and identification of a proline-rich region homologue (PRRH) in the HTLV SU</title><p>As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, our alignment of the MLV and HTLV SU reveals several notable motif conservations outlining a similar modular organization of the MLV SU and HTLV SU. A (K/R)LL(T/N)LVQ motif, highly conserved between the F-MLV and HTLV-1 SU, is located immediately downstream of the PRR and its PRRH counterpart, respectively. Another highly conserved motif between MLV and HTLV, GXDP, is found immediately upstream of the PRR/PRRH (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). These two motifs compelled us to notice the PRRH, between the PSQ and KLLTLVQ sequences in HTLV-1, and between the PTQ and KILKFIQ sequences in HTLV-2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). As counted from the first and last proline in the delineated sequence, the PRRH has a proline content of 30.8% and 30.4% for HTLV-1 and -2, respectively. This is slightly lower than the 35.3%, 36%, 36%, and 35.6% proline content for the ecotropic, polytropic, xenotropic, and amphotropic MLV Env, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The presence of a PRRH in the HTLV SU appeared to be characteristic of their MLV-like modular organization, since HTLV SU average proline content outside of the PRRH does not exceed 11%.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional, soluble HTLV Env-receptor binding determinants</title><p>MLV SU receptor binding determinants are all located upstream of the PRR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. To test whether the HTLV Env receptor binding determinants are also located upstream of the potential PRRH, we constructed a chimeric Env and several soluble HTLV-1 and -2 SU amino terminal subdomains. The chimeric HTLV/MLV Env, H1<sub>183</sub>FEnv, comprises the 183 amino terminal residues of the HTLV-1 SU ending with the PSQL residues fused to the PIGP sequence of the F-MLV PRR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In this Env chimera the receptor-binding domain (first 269 residues) of the F-MLV Env was replaced with the potentially corresponding domain of the HTLV-1 Env SU (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The chimeric H1<sub>183</sub>FEnv construct &#x02013; which lacks the HTLV PRRH but has the MLV PRR &#x02013; was properly expressed in transfected cells and was revealed on immunoblots with an anti-MLV SU polyclonal antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Accordingly, an anti-HTLV-1 monoclonal antibody raised against a PRRH epitope did not bind this chimeric Env (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic representation of HTLV/MLV Env chimeras and HTLV SU amino terminal subdomains. </bold>Env landmark positions are indicated and SU landmark sequences and positions are indicated by arrowheads.

The H1<sub>215</sub>FEnv and H1<sub>183</sub>FEnv HTLV/MLV Env chimeras were obtained by replacing the 329 and 269 amino terminal residues of the F-MLV Env (open boxes) with the amino terminal 215 and 183 amino acid residues of the HTLV-1 Env (solid boxes), respectively.

The H1<sub>215</sub>SU and H2<sub>211</sub>SU subdomains comprise the first 215 and 211 residues, counting from the first methionine in the signal peptide through the KLLTLVQ of HTLV-1 and KILKFIQ of HTLV-2 Env, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The H1<sub>179</sub>SU and H2<sub>178</sub>SU, comprising the amino terminal 179 and 178 amino acids of the HTLV-1 and -2 Env, respectively, exclude the PRRH sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p><p>Cell lysates and cell culture supernatants were analyzed to evaluate intracellular expression and secretion of functional SU amino terminal domains in transfected-cell cultures, respectively. H1<sub>215</sub>SU and H2<sub>211</sub>SU, containing the PRRH sequence, and H2<sub>178</sub>SU lacking this PRRH were all efficiently expressed in transfected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). It is noteworthy, however, that recovery of tagged H1<sub>179</sub>SU molecules was largely inefficient because the vast majority of this protein was cleaved (data not shown). In contrast, no significant cleavage was observed with the other soluble domains released in the medium (not shown) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). As expected for immunoadhesins, H1<sub>215</sub>SU, H2<sub>211</sub>SU, and H2<sub>178</sub>SU rFc-tagged domains were detected as dimers under non-reducing conditions (not shown). Immunoblots of cell extracts revealed two forms of intracellular H1<sub>215</sub>SU and H2<sub>211</sub>SU (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>); this was likely due to variable glycosylation of these subdomains. However, a single secreted, soluble form of each of these amino terminal subdomains was detected in cell culture supernatants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).</p><p>A truncated Ampho-MLV SU-rFc fusion protein that comprises the amino terminal 397 residues of the Ampho-MLV Env fused to a carboxy terminal rFc tag was constructed (A<sub>397</sub>SU) and used as a heterologous control.

Using this cell surface binding assay, all of the soluble HTLV SU subdomains bound to the A23 hamster fibroblast cell line (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) as well as to all other cell lines tested, including 293T (human kidney fibroblasts), NIH3T3 and NIH3T3TK<sup>- </sup>(murine fibroblasts) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], HeLa (human ovarian carcinoma cells), D17 (canine fibroblast), Jurkat (suspension human T cell line), activated primary human T cells, and numerous other cell lines and primary cell types that are thought to express the HTLV receptor. As expected from our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], none of these soluble HTLV SU subdomains showed detectable binding on resting T lymphocytes. Notably, binding of the HTLV SU to these cells occurred whether they formed or not syncytia in the presence of HTLV Env [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and data not shown). Binding by H2<sub>178</sub>SU was similar to H2<sub>211</sub>SU, demonstrating that the first 158 residues of the mature HTLV-2 SU, without the 20 amino acids of the amino terminal signal peptide, are sufficient for cell surface binding, and therefore that the PRRH is not required for receptor binding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>HTLV-1 and -2 SU subdomains interfere with HTLV Env SU cell surface binding. </bold>(A) Conditioned medium from control 293T cells (open histograms) or from 293T cells expressing soluble rFc-tagged HTLV-1 H1<sub>215</sub>SU, HTLV-2 H2<sub>211</sub>SU and H2<sub>178</sub>SU, or Ampho-MLV A<sub>397</sub>SU subdomains (filled histograms), were incubated with A23 hamster cells for 30' at 37&#x000b0;C and binding was assessed by flow cytometry following addition of a secondary FITC-conjugated anti rabbit IgG antibody.

Indeed, nearly complete interference was observed when cells were transfected with the amino terminal subdomain constructs, in the presence and absence of PRRH sequences (H1<sub>215</sub>SU and H2<sub>211</sub>SU versus H1<sub>183</sub>FEnv and H2<sub>178</sub>SU) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). This effect was specific as HTLV SU binding was not inhibited by a heterologous A<sub>397</sub>SU domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Therefore, we showed that the first 163 and 158 residues, with a cleaved signal peptide, of the mature HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 SU, respectively, contained the entire HTLV Env RBD. These data also showed that HTLV-1 and 2 cross-interfered, consistent with the fact that they recognize the same cell surface receptor for infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Interference to HTLV Env-mediated cell-to-cell fusion by HTLV SU amino terminal subdomains</title><p>Viral envelope interference occurs when cell surface receptors are occupied by receptor-interacting Env components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].

Interference to cell fusion was measured using a quantitative HTLV envelope cell fusion interference assay (CFIA), as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>HTLV-1 Env-induced cell fusion was significantly diminished upon expression of the H1<sub>215</sub>SU subdomain in target cells, 12% &#x000b1; 2% of control fusion (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001), consistent with previous observations using the H1<sub>215</sub>FEnv chimera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].

Altogether, these results confirmed our findings that receptor-binding determinants are present within the first 183 and 178 amino acids of the HTLV-1 and -2 Env, respectively.

HTLV Env-pseudotyped MLV virions, MLV(HTLV), were produced to infect 293T target cells. Because these recombinant cell-free virions are not competent for replication, this viral pseudotype infection assay tests a single round of infection, and does not measure replication and subsequent exponential viral dissemination. Therefore, relative infection values are expressed in linear rather than logarithmic scales.</p><p>Infection of mock-transfected target cells, devoid of interfering Env domains, resulted in a mean infection value of 9905 &#x000b1; 1117 infectious units per ml (iu/ml), and this was taken as 100% control infection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Similar values, 8803 &#x000b1; 1871 iu/ml or 89% &#x000b1; 19% of control infection, were obtained upon infection of target cells expressing a heterologous SU subdomain, A<sub>397</sub>SU (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Expression of the H1<sub>183</sub>FEnv and H1<sub>215</sub>FEnv chimeric Env in target cells significantly reduced MLV(HTLV) infection to 324 &#x000b1; 98 iu/ml, 3.3% &#x000b1; 1% of control infection, and to 307 &#x000b1; 129 iu/ml, 3.1% &#x000b1; 1.3% of control infection, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> and data not shown). Similarly, the H2<sub>178</sub>SU and H2<sub>211</sub>SU subdomains diminished MLV(HTLV) infection to 191 &#x000b1; 56 iu/ml and 215 &#x000b1; 122 iu/ml, 1.9% &#x000b1; 0.6% and 2.2% &#x000b1; 1.3% of control infection, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The specificity of interference to infection by HTLV Env constructs was assessed by their lack of interference abilities toward Ampho-MLV Env-pseudotyped virions, MLV(Ampho) (data not shown). Thus, for both HTLV-1 and -2, the amino terminal domain upstream of the PRRH was sufficient for specific interference to HTLV Env-mediated infection. Furthermore, in contrast to the cell fusion interference assays described above, the PRRH did not detectably influence MLV(HTLV) infection.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>HTLV-1 and -2 SU subdomains interfere with infection by HTLV envelope-pseudotyped virions. </bold>293T cells (5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>) expressing the indicated interfering Env derivatives were infected with cell-free HTLV-2 Env-pseudotyped virions MLV(HTLV) carrying a LacZ reporter gene.

To determine whether mutations of these residues had an effect on receptor binding, we generated H1<sub>215</sub>SU subdomains with either Arg<sub>94 </sub>or Ser<sub>101 </sub>mutated to Ala, yielding the mutant H1(R94A)SU and H1(S101A)SU subdomains, respectively. We also evaluated mutations of Asp<sub>106</sub>, mutant H1(D106A)SU, and Tyr<sub>114</sub>, mutant H1(Y114A)SU, both residues found to be highly conserved between all human and simian T cell leukemia viruses (unpublished observations). Surprisingly, cell surface binding profiles of H1(R94A)SU and H1(S101A)SU mutants were not significantly altered when compared to binding by the parental H1<sub>215</sub>SU, whereas the H1(D106A)SU mutant presented reduced binding to HTLV receptor-bearing cells and the H1(Y114A)SU mutant showed a nearly complete abrogation of cell surface binding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). Loss of binding observed with the two latter mutants was not due to decreased soluble SU fragment production, as assessed by immunoblotting of transfected-cell culture media (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). Moreover, equivalent binding profiles were obtained when the same mutations were introduced into the HTLV-2 soluble RBD H2<sub>178</sub>SU (data not shown). Altogether, these experiments demonstrated that Tyr<sub>114</sub>, and to a lesser extent Asp<sub>106</sub>, are key residues involved in HTLV Env receptor binding.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>HTLV-1 SU amino terminal domain mutants. </bold>(A) H1<sub>215</sub>SU constructs were generated with the following SU amino terminal point mutations; R94A, S101A, D106A and Y114A.

As mentioned above, all wild-type and mutant HTLV SU subdomains were produced and secreted with a similar efficiency (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). Expression of the H1(D106A)SU and H1(Y114A)SU mutants, with decreased capacities to bind the HTLV receptor, correlated with decreased interference to HTLV Env-mediated cell fusion and infection. Indeed, H1(Y114A)SU, which had nearly undetectable level of binding, showed the lowest levels of interference and thus allowed the highest levels of HTLV Env-mediated cell fusion and infection (56% &#x000b1; 16% and 46% &#x000b1; 10%, respectively) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Nevertheless, levels of fusion and infection were lower than that observed when the heterologous A<sub>397</sub>SU was used as a negative control of interference (83% &#x000b1; 11% and 89% &#x000b1; 19% for cell fusion and infection, respectively). Thus, overexpression of mutant HTLV SU fragments with highly decreased receptor binding abilities can still exert, albeit to a significantly lesser extent, interference to HTLV Env-mediated cell fusion and infection.</p><p>We found that similar levels of interference to HTLV Env-mediated cell fusion and infection were observed when either the parental H1<sub>215</sub>SU or the mutant H1(S101A)SU were expressed in target cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). This is consistent with the capacity of this mutant to bind target cells at levels similar to that of wild type H1<sub>215</sub>SU. However, interference to HTLV Env-mediated cell fusion and infection did not always correlate with cell surface binding profiles. While the H1(R94A)SU mutant inhibited cell fusion and infection, its effects were significantly lower than those of the wild-type H1<sub>215</sub>SU (56% &#x000b1; 8% and 32% &#x000b1; 2.3%, respectively) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B,7C</xref>). Thus, although neither Arg<sub>94 </sub>nor Ser<sub>101 </sub>of the HTLV-1 SU appears to play a direct role in binding, Arg<sub>94 </sub>modulates HTLV Env-mediated fusion and infection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), likely via post-binding effects rather than binding <italic>per se</italic>. In conclusion, Tyr114 appeared as the main determinant identified so far for HTLV Env binding, whereas the effects previously described with Arg<sub>94 </sub>and Ser<sub>101 </sub>are most likely associated with post-binding events.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we report the generation of MLV Env with chimeric HTLV/MLV SU and truncated HTLV-1 and -2 amino terminal SU subdomains that can be expressed in and secreted from eukaryotic cell lines in functional, soluble form. Using these constructs, we demonstrated that the amino terminal 163 and 158 residues (i.e., expunged of their Env signal peptide) of the mature HTLV-1 and -2 Env SU, respectively, were sufficient to exert both HTLV receptor binding and efficient interference to diverse HTLV Env-mediated functions, including binding, cell-to-cell fusion and cell-free as well as cell-to-cell infection. Although the PRRH sequence comprising amino acid residues 180 to 215 of the HTLV-1 Env and 176 to 211 of the HTLV-2 Env was previously thought to be a receptor binding site, our data preclude a major role for this region in the binding properties described above. Indeed, whereas a synthetic peptide composed of amino acids 197 to 216 and located within the HTLV-1 PRRH, has been reported to interfere with HTLV Env-induced syncytia formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], this peptide was later shown to compete neither with receptor binding of the entire HTLV-1 Env SU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], nor with infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. It is therefore likely that the effects reported for PRRH-derived peptides, as measured by syncytia formation, are solely due to post-receptor binding events. However, we identified Tyr<sub>114 </sub>of the HTLV-1 Env, which corresponds to Tyr<sub>110 </sub>of the HTLV-2 Env, as a key residue in HTLV Env binding and for all the aforementioned HTLV Env-mediated functional assays. We could not detect binding of H1(Y114A)SU by flow cytometry, while this mutant exerted residual, albeit significantly decreased, interference to HTLV Env-mediated cell fusion and infection. Altered folding outside of the binding domain <italic>per se</italic>, rather than direct alteration of the receptor-binding site, could also account for the lack of binding of this mutant. However, we favor the latter hypothesis, since the H1(Y114A)SU mutant was properly folded and transported to the plasma membrane and secreted in the medium as efficiently as wild type RBD, thus arguing against gross misfolding of this mutant. Accordingly, Tyr<sub>114 </sub>appears to be conserved in all known human and simian T cell leukemia viruses strains, which share the same receptor.</p><p>The receptor-binding site in MLV RBD is composed of a combination of several cysteine loops located upstream of the PRR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] which is linked to a conserved anti-parallel &#x003b2; core [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The isolation of an F-MLV SU amino terminal subdomain allowed crystallization of MLV RBD and the modeling of the RBD cysteine loop arrangement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The precise organization of cysteine loops, likely to harbor the receptor binding determinants, within the HTLV SU amino terminus remains to be established. Nevertheless, the identification of Tyr<sub>114 </sub>as a key HTLV-1 RBD residue points at this determinant as a very likely receptor-binding core. This, together with previous works relying on syncytia formation and cell-to-cell transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], will help to distinguish between <italic>bona fide </italic>receptor binding determinants and determinants involved at a post-binding level.</p><p>Another recently identified determinant, the Pro-His-Gln SU motif conserved among gammaretroviruses such as MLV and feline leukemia viruses (FeLV), has been determined to play a major role in viral entry during post-binding events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The mechanism of this effect involves a direct interaction of MLV SU soluble forms with Env attached SU carboxy terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. This interaction between the SU amino and carboxy termini leads to the T cell-restricted tropism of a natural isolate of FeLV, FeLV T, in which the SU Pro-His-Gln motif is mutated. Indeed, FeLV T is restricted in cat to T cells because they naturally express an endogenous soluble FeLV RBD-related factor called FeLIX that trans-complements the lack of the SU Pro-His-Gln motif in the FeLV T Env and restores its post-binding defect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Despite the HTLV-1 and F-MLV SU homologous modular organization and the assignment of several common motifs between the two latter SU, no obvious Pro-His-Gln motif homologue is present in the HTLV SU amino terminus. Whether a FeLIX-like molecule that interacts with HTLV Env exists in human T cells remains to be addressed. Furthermore, the fact that the Pro-His-Gln has been shown to play a major role in transactivation of viral infection in several gammaretroviruses which are efficiently infectious as cell-free virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], raises the question whether the apparent lack of such a motif in the HTLV simple oncovirus-like SU is linked to the relative inefficiency of HTLV Env-mediated infection by cell-free virions. The HTLV SU subdomains described here should prove to be valuable in addressing such questions.</p><p>The recent identification of Glut1, the ubiquitous glucose transporter of vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], as a receptor for HTLV Env [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] adds an additional similarity between the Env of HTLV, a deltaretrovirus, and that of gammaretroviruses. All these virus Env recognize multimembrane-spanning metabolite transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. This and the common modular organization of the HTLV and MLV SU raise questions regarding the origin of the HTLV Env. It has previously been reported that envelopes of invertebrate retroviruses may have been "captured" from other viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. As HTLV and MLV have strongly divergent overall genomic organizations, "envelope capture" from related ancestor genes might account for the close relationship between the Env of these phylogenetically distant viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have generated truncated domains of the HTLV Env amino terminus, upstream of residues 183 and 178 of the HTLV-1 and -2 Env, respectively, that were sufficient to bind target cells of different species through interaction with the HTLV Env receptor. We also identified a tyrosine at position 114 and 110 in HTLV-1 and -2 Env, respectively, as a key determinant for this binding. In addition to their use for further exploration of the mechanisms involved in HTLV entry, the tagged HTLV-1 and -2 RBD subdomains described here are novel tools for the detection of Glut1 cell surface expression and intracellular trafficking. Indeed, we tracked intracellular expression of EGFP-tagged HTLV SU subdomains by time-lapse microscopy, and found that they are preferentially routed toward cell-cell contact areas (unpublished observations), where Glut1 is particularly abundant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] and our unpublished observations). Furthermore, those HTLV SU derivatives could be of particular importance in view of the key roles played by Glut1 in various biological processes, including T cell survival and activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], tumor genesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], and neuronal activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Interestingly, soluble HTLV SU subdomains inhibit Glut1-mediated glucose transport, and accordingly, expression of mutants with diminished receptor binding ability resulted in less pronounced inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and data not shown). Thus, these HTLV SU derivatives could also be used as glucose transport inhibitors. These data demonstrate the potential for the novel and broad utility of these reagents in the study of HTLV infection as well as biological processes involving glucose transport and metabolism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Construction of chimeric Env and HTLV-1 and -2 SU subdomains</title><p>To exchange the PRR and PRRH regions, we introduced an allelic <italic>Mfe</italic>I restriction site in the HTLV-1 and F-MLV Env.

Supernatants were recovered 48 hours post transfection and filtered through 0.45 &#x003bc;m pore-size membrane to remove cell debris, and stored at -80&#x000b0;C. The pCLMFG-LacZ plasmid is a retroviral expression vector that provides a packageable RNA coding for the <italic>LacZ </italic>gene marker. pCSI/Ampho is an expression vector encoding the Ampho-MLV Env, and the HTLV-2 Env expression vector, pCSIX/H2, is described above.</p><p>Virion-containing supernatants were used to infect target 293T cells expressing the chimeric Env or HTLV RBD subdomains. Transfection efficiencies of target 293T cells were &#x0003e;80% in all experiments. Infections were performed 36&#x02013;48 hours post-transfection on cultures grown in 12 well plates (Costar) at 37&#x000b0;C, medium was changed 24 hours later, and confluent cell monolayers were fixed, stained for &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity before counting blue foci. Interference to infection was determined by infecting transfected target cells with approximately 100 and 1000 iu. Infection was evaluated as described above, and the number of LacZ-positive blue colonies counted was normalized by multiplying by the appropriate dilution factor. The resulting infection values were analyzed as iu/ml of virus containing supernatant. Subsequently the relative infection levels in cells expressing the HTLV SU domains were compared to those of mock transfected cells and were expressed as percentages of control infection (% control).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations used</title><p>HTLV Human T-cell leukemia virus</p><p>SU envelope extracellular surface component</p><p>Env envelope glycoprotein</p><p>MLV murine leukemia virus</p><p>F-MLV Friend-MLV</p><p>RBD receptor-binding domain</p><p>PRR proline-rich region</p><p>PRRH proline rich region homologue</p><p>Ampho amphotropic</p><p>HA influenza hemagglutinin</p><p>rFc rabbit immunoglobulin constant fragment</p><p>A<sub>397</sub>SU Ampho-MLV Env fused to a carboxy terminal rFc tag</p><p>CFIA cell fusion interference assay</p><p>iu/ml infectious units per ml</p><p>Arg<sub>94</sub>arginine 94</p><p>Ser<sub>101</sub>serine 101</p><p>Tyr<sub>114</sub>tyrosine 114</p><p>FeLV feline leukemia viruses</p><p>HBS Hepes buffered saline</p><p>PBS phosphate-buffered saline</p><p>SDS sodium dodecyl sulfate</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>FJK designed and realized or supervised most of the experiments and co-wrote the manuscript.
