Despite the extensive knowledge of the "light genome&#x0201d;, the poorly understood "dark genome" remains understudied. In this study, we integrated data from 20,412 protein-coding genes in Pharos and 8,395 patient-derived tumours from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to examine the genetic and pharmacological dependencies in human cancers and their treatment implications. We discovered that dark genes exhibited high mutation rates in certain cancers, similar to light genes. By combining the drug response profiles of cancer cells with cell fitness post-CRISPR-mediated gene knockout, we identified the crucial vulnerabilities associated with both dark and light genes. Our analysis also revealed that tumours harbouring dark gene mutations displayed worse overall and disease-free survival rates than those without such mutations. Furthermore, dark gene expression levels significantly influenced patient survival outcomes. Our findings demonstrated a similar distribution of genetic and pharmacological dependencies across the light and dark genomes, suggesting that targeting the dark genome holds promise for cancer treatment. This study underscores the need for ongoing research on the dark genome to better comprehend the underlying mechanisms of cancer and develop more effective therapies.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="26"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its <xref rid="sec019" ref-type="sec">Supporting Information</xref> files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its <xref rid="sec019" ref-type="sec">Supporting Information</xref> files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human genome comprises approximately 19,000&#x02013;25,000 protein-coding gene sequences, accounting for 1&#x02013;2% of the genome [<xref rid="pone.0296029.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0296029.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

The lack of knowledge surrounding these genes poses a considerable obstacle to the advancement of personalised medicine, despite the ever-growing comprehension of the human genome [<xref rid="pone.0296029.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0296029.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. While our understanding of the human genome has undeniably facilitated the diagnosis of genetic diseases and the development of targeted therapies for various pathological disorders, such as cancer [<xref rid="pone.0296029.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], the dark genome represents a substantial challenge to the progress of personalised medicine [<xref rid="pone.0296029.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The inability to decipher the functions and significance of these genes limits our ability to tailor medical treatments based on individual genetic variations, thereby impeding the full realisation of personalised medicine&#x02019;s potential [<xref rid="pone.0296029.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Overcoming this obstacle requires extensive research aimed at unravelling the mysteries of the dark genome, shedding light on its function, and unlocking its therapeutic potential.</p><p>Large molecular profiling projects, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project [<xref rid="pone.0296029.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], have extensively profiled human cancers, providing valuable insights into their molecular landscapes and potential therapeutic targets. The Achilles project utilises CRISPR technology to explore gene dependencies in cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0296029.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], whereas the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) [<xref rid="pone.0296029.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopaedia (CCLE) [<xref rid="pone.0296029.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] projects screen thousands of cancer cell lines for small-molecule inhibitor responses. These efforts have generated vast publicly accessible data for advancing cancer understanding and treatment and uncovering the mysteries of the dark genome. The Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project has compiled dark gene data from over 60 sources to identify new therapeutic targets and advance cancer understanding [<xref rid="pone.0296029.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0296029.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This effort led to the development of the Target Central Resource Database (TCRD), which is a comprehensive database that integrates various data types. To facilitate easy exploration and sharing of this data, a web-based platform called Pharos was created [<xref rid="pone.0296029.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Integrating the different datasets from TCGA, Achilles, GDSC, CCLE, and IDG projects is essential for illuminating the dark genome and overcoming obstacles posed by unstudied human genes, thus facilitating the advancement of personalised medicine. In this study, we extensively analysed the distribution of genes in both light and dark genomes, investigated the mutation frequency of dark genes across various human cancer types, and assessed their impact on the chemosensitivity of cancer cell lines and aggressiveness of cancer. Our comprehensive analysis aimed to provide valuable insights into the role of the dark genome in human cancers and contribute to a better understanding of the genetic landscape of these diseases. Furthermore, by leveraging information from large-scale molecular profiling projects, we underscore the importance of continued research on the dark genome and the integration of multiple datasets to enhance our understanding of its impact on cancer, ultimately promoting more effective, targeted therapies for cancer and other genetic disorders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>The study protocol received approval from the University of Zambia; Health Sciences Research Ethics Committee (IRB00011000).

See <ext-link xlink:href="https://depmap.org/portal/" ext-link-type="uri">https://depmap.org/portal/</ext-link> for information on Achilles&#x02019; CRISPR-derived gene dependency descriptions. Briefly, a lower score indicates a higher likelihood of cell line dependency on a given gene. A score of 0 corresponds to a non-essential gene, while -1 corresponds to the median of all &#x0201c;common essential genes&#x0201d;. The database groups genes into four primary categories based on cell line fitness after CRISPR-mediated gene knockouts:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Common essential genes&#x02013;consistently ranked in the top X most depleted genes in at least 90% of cell lines.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Strongly selective genes&#x02013;genes with a dependency skewed-likelihood ratio test (LRT) value &#x0003e; 100.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Essential genes&#x02013;associated with cell fitness in only one or a few cell lines, but with a dependency skewed-LRT value &#x0003c; 100.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Non-essential genes&#x02013;show no effect on the cell fitness in any of the 688 tested cell lines.</p></list-item></list><p>We incorporated TDL information from Pharos and CRISPR data to examine the impact of Tdark genes on cancer cell lines. Our assessment involved comparing the mean gene dependency scores obtained from CRISPR data to determine the importance of genes within each developmental stage for cancer cell lines across all cancer types and within each cancer type.</p><p>Additionally, we calculated and compared the number of common essential and non-essential genes across the Pharos development levels (<xref rid="pone.0296029.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>) to understand how gene dependence relates to TDL classes. We then compared the number of PubMed publications, monoclonal antibodies, and polyclonal antibodies available for each group of genes (common essential versus non-essential genes).</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Impact of common essential genes on cell fitness</title><p>To further investigate gene essentiality, we collected mRNA transcription data for 756 cancer cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopaedia (CCLE) database [<xref rid="pone.0296029.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Using CRISPR-derived dependence scores, we identified essential genes across cell lines by counting the number of instances in which each gene&#x02019;s score was less than -0.5. This threshold was chosen based on the recommendation of the Achilles project, indicating reduced cell fitness after CRISPR-mediated gene knockouts. We then tallied instances where the CRISPR-derived dependence score was less than -0.5 for each gene in each cell line to identify genes associated with a reduction in cell fitness across all cell lines. Genes with a significant number of instances were identified as essential, as they were critical for cell survival and growth. Finally, we compared Achilles CRISPR-based fitness scores with transcription profiles.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Evaluation of the extent to which the dark genome affects the chemosensitivity of cancer cells in relation to the light genome</title><p>We analysed drug-response data from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database [<xref rid="pone.0296029.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.cancerrxgene.org/" ext-link-type="uri">www.cancerRxgene.org</ext-link>), to investigate the influence of the dark genome on cancer cell chemosensitivity compared to the light genome. The GDSC database provides comprehensive information on human cancer cell lines treated with a wide range of anticancer drugs that target various signalling pathways. We retrieved the dose-responses for 380 cancer cell lines to 397 drugs that target components of 24 different pathways. Additionally, we used Pharos to obtain information on the TDL annotation of light and dark genes.</p><p>We conducted a series of analyses for each pathway gene (e.g., <italic toggle="yes">MFSD1</italic>) in the context of the CRISPR dependency scores and mutations in cancer cell lines. Firstly, we divided the cell lines into two groups: (1) those with a high CRISPR dependency score on the gene (e.g., <italic toggle="yes">MFSD1</italic> dependence score &#x0003c; -0.5), and (2) those with low dependence on that gene (e.g., <italic toggle="yes">MFSD1</italic> dependence score &#x0003e; 0.5). Subsequently, we used the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare the IC50 values of 397 pathway inhibitors between these two groups of cell lines. Additionally, for each pathway gene, we further categorised the cell lines into two groups: (1) those with mutations in the specific gene (e.g., cell lines with <italic toggle="yes">MFSD1</italic> mutations), and (2) those without mutations in that gene (e.g., cell lines with no <italic toggle="yes">MFSD1</italic> mutations).

We conducted an analysis of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in cancer patients, considering the mutation status and mRNA expression levels of dark genes to ascertain if specific patient groups exhibited distinct clinical outcomes. We obtained and analysed a pan-cancer dataset from TCGA, which included mRNA expression levels, mutations, and completely de-identified clinical information (refer to the Methods section).</p><p>We categorised patients&#x02019; tumours into two groups based on their mutation status to assess their impact on OS and DFS.

These groups were defined as high or low expression according to the mRNA transcript levels of a particular dark gene. Using the Kaplan-Meier method, we found that, of the 3,347 dark genes whose expression varied across 8,395 patient tumours analysed, OS periods were significantly shorter for 978 (29.22%) dark genes in patients with tumours expressing high-mRNA transcripts of a specific dark gene.

We found that, of the top 50 dark genes that exhibited a significant association with reduced OS in each of the 28 cancer types (p-value &#x0003c; 0.05), many genes demonstrated an impact on OS across multiple cancer types. For instance, <italic toggle="yes">ABCA11P</italic> is associated with reduced OS in both oesophageal carcinoma and glioblastoma multiforme.
