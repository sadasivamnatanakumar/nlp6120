In this study we have examined in detail the determinants for Tax-mediated transcriptional activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Whereas previously the LTR enhancer elements were thought to be the sole Tax-targets, herein, we find that the core HTLV-I TATAA motif also provides specific responsiveness not seen with either the SV40 or the E1b TATAA boxes. When enhancer elements which can mediate Tax-responsiveness were compared, the authentic HTLV-I 21-bp repeats were found to be the most effective. Related bZIP factors such as CREB, ATF4, c-Jun and LZIP are often thought to recognize the 21-bp repeats equivalently. However, amongst bZIP factors, we found that CREB, by far, is preferred by Tax for activation. When LTR transcription was reconstituted by substituting either &#x003ba;B or serum response elements in place of the 21-bp repeats, Tax activated these surrogate motifs using surfaces which are different from that utilized for CREB interaction. Finally, we employed artificial recruitment of TATA-binding protein to the HTLV-I promoter in "bypass" experiments to show for the first time that Tax has transcriptional activity subsequent to the assembly of an initiation complex at the promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Optimal activation of the HTLV-I LTR by Tax specifically requires the core HTLV-I TATAA promoter, CREB and the 21-bp repeats. In addition, we also provide the first evidence for transcriptional activity of Tax after the recruitment of TATA-binding protein to the promoter.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>In eukaryotes, transcription by RNA polymerase II requires the orderly recruitment of basal transcription factors and activators to the core promoter and enhancers, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The core promoter contains the transcription initiation site, and it provides the docking sites for the basal transcription factors that nucleate the assembly of a functional preinitiation complex (PIC). The TATA box is one of four major core promoter elements, and it is specifically recognized by the TATA-binding protein (TBP), a subunit of the basal transcription factor TFIID which also contains at least 14 TBP-associated factors (TAFs). On the other hand, enhancers are bound by sequence-specific transcriptional activators that are thought to promote PIC assembly through interactions with components of the basal transcription machinery.</p><p>Human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) Tax protein is a unique transcriptional regulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Tax can modulate the HTLV-I long terminal repeats (LTR), heterologous viral promoters, and a variety of cellular genes. In most context, Tax acts as a potent transcriptional activator through Tax-responsive DNA elements that are recognized by cellular transcription factors CREB, NF&#x003ba;B and serum response factor (SRF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. For activation of the HTLV-I LTR, Tax targets three imperfectly conserved 21-bp direct repeats flanked by GC-rich sequences. In this scenario, Tax forms a ternary complex with CREB and the 21-bp repeat through physical interaction with CREB and direct contact with the flanking GC-rich sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Tax-induced activation of other promoters is thought to be mediated through protein-protein interactions. Thus, Tax is a pleiotropic transcriptional activator that targets multiple enhancer elements through multiple cellular transcription factors.</p><p>To date, the molecular mechanisms for Tax trans-activation have been well studied. Due to its pleiotropic activities, there are likely nuances to Tax's activity which remain unrevealed. Currently, we understand Tax to harbor a minimal activation domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], to interact with basal transcription factors such as TBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], to form a homo-dimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and to stimulate the dimerization of cellular regulatory factors such as CREB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and IKK-&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Moreover, we also know that Tax can directly engage transcriptional coactivators such as CREB-binding protein, p300 and P/CAF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, it remains unclear what is Tax's optimal preference for an enhancer &#x02013; TATAA configuration. It has also been unaddressed whether Tax has a transcriptional activity after the formation of an initiation complex at the TATAA-box.</p><p>In mammalian cells, the artificial recruitment of TBP sufficiently activates transcription from some promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. It is understood that the structure of core promoter is one important determinant for this activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. On the other hand, DNA-tethered TBP can also work synergistically with selective natural activators such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and cytomegalovirus IE2 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In this regard, it is not known whether TBP recruitment suffices for activation of HTLV-I minimal promoter. Nor is it clear whether Tax can cooperate with promoter-tethered TBP.</p><p>Here, we have constructed a series of chimeric enhancer-TATAA reporters to analyze the functional roles of these transcription elements in Tax-mediated activation. We observed that Tax activates the HTLV-I 21-bp repeats more potently than other enhancer elements. Analysis of ten mutants of Tax revealed that Tax utilizes different domains to target different cellular factors. We also found that multiple bZIP transcription factors including the newly-identified LZIP are involved in Tax activation of HTLV-I LTR. Finally, two other salient findings are that optimal Tax-responsiveness is specified by the HTLV-I-specific TATAA element, and that Tax synergizes with artificially recruited, DNA-tethered, TBP in a phase of transcription after the assembly of an initiation complex at the promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Specific preference by Tax for only one enhancer element</title><p>Tax can activate transcription through 21-bp repeats, CRE, &#x003ba;B site or SRE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, a direct head-to-head comparison between the relative preferences of Tax for each of these elements is complicated by the context of additional DNA elements in the various promoters tested to date (i.e. the HTLV-I LTR versus the HIV-1 LTR versus the interleukin-2 promoter). To directly compare enhancer motifs, they should be placed in identical TATAA-context and tested in identical experimental settings. Towards this end, we constructed a series of six reporters to dissect the ordered preference of Tax for various enhancers.</p><p>Each reporter contains two copies of enhancer motifs (21-bp repeats, CRE, AP1, Sp1, &#x003ba;B or SRE) and a minimal HTLV-I TATAA promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Because all reporters have the same HTLV-1 minimal promoter and are otherwise devoid of any known enhancer elements, side-by-side comparisons would reflect directly the contribution of the variously added cis-enhancer. We observed that the &#x003ba;B- and CRE- motifs had the highest basal activities in HeLa cells in the absence of Tax (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, lanes 3, 4, 9 and 10; and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, columns 3 and 6 compared to column 1). Of significant interest, in stark contrast to the cellular CRE elements, the reiterated HTLV-I 21-bp repeats (normally considered as viral CRE elements) and the SRE exerted little or no basal activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, lanes 1, 2, 11 and 12; and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, lanes 2 and 7 compared to lane 1). The AP1 and Sp1 sites were moderately active (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, lanes 5&#x02013;8 and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, lanes 4 and 5). Hence for basal expression in the context of the HTLV-I TATAA promoter, &#x003ba;B, CRE &#x0003e; AP1, Sp1 &#x0003e;&#x0003e; 21 bp, SRE.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Relative responsiveness of enhancers to Tax in HeLa cells.

Transcription from the 21-bp repeats was stimulated approximately 70-fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, lane 2 compared to lane 1) while that from the Sp1 site, not prototypically known to be responsive to Tax, was not activated significantly over the activity of the HTLV-I minimal promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>, lane 5 compared to lane 1). All other responses to Tax were markedly weaker than that seen from the 21-bp repeats. Hence, for all practical purposes, only a duplicated 21-bp repeat in the context of isolated placement upstream of an authentic HTLV-I minimal TATAA box could be regarded as significantly Tax-responsive in HeLa cells.</p><p>We repeated the experiments in Jurkat T lymphocytes and obtained similar results (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Thus, while the &#x003ba;B and CRE enhancers displayed the highest activities in the absence of Tax (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, lanes 3 and 6 compared to lanes 5, 4, 2, 1, and 7), only the 21-bp repeats were highly responsive to Tax (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, lanes 1 and 2; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, lane 2). Our results from HeLa and Jurkat cells consistently support the preferential activation of the 21-bp repeats by Tax.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Relative responsiveness of enhancers to Tax in JPX9 cells.

The low activation of the latter motifs, although comparatively less significant than that from the 21 bp elements, was real and reproducible. To further understand how Tax works, we wondered whether the different magnitudes of activation were due to quantitative or qualitative differences in protein-protein interaction. To address this question, we examined the separate responses of the three motifs to a battery of Tax mutants.</p><p>Previously we had characterized 47 mutations in Tax that affect transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Here we selected 10 of these Tax mutants to shed light on the discrete surfaces used by Tax to mediate effects on 21-bp repeats, &#x003ba;B and SRE. All mutants were expressed to comparable levels in HeLa cells (data not shown). Their relative activities on 21-bp repeats, &#x003ba;B and SRE were assessed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Differential activities of Tax mutants on 21-bp repeats (<bold>A</bold>), &#x003ba;B (<bold>B</bold>), and SRE (<bold>C</bold>) motifs. One microgram of plasmid expressing the indicated Tax mutants plus 5 &#x003bc;g of p21-HTLV-CAT, pKB-HTLV-CAT or pSRE-HTLV-CAT was individually transfected into HeLa cells. CAT activity from wild type Tax-transfected cells (lane 1) was taken as 100%.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1742-4690-1-18-3"/></fig><p>Based on percentage of activation relative to wild type Tax, we saw three patterns of mutant activity for 21 bp, &#x003ba;B and SRE (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Hence, the activation domain mutant Tax L320G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and the zinc finger mutant Tax H52Q [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] were defective in activating either 21-bp repeats or SRE, but were fully competent for &#x003ba;B (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, lanes 4 and 10). By contrast, the N-terminal mutant Tax &#x00394;3&#x02013;6 and the point mutant Tax S258A activated 21-bp repeats and SRE well, but did not activate &#x003ba;B (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, lanes 2 and 7). Additionally, mutants Tax &#x00394;94&#x02013;114, Tax S150A and Tax &#x00394;337&#x02013;353 were active on all three motifs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, lanes 5, 6 and 11), while neither Tax &#x00394;2&#x02013;58, Tax &#x00394; 284&#x02013;353 nor Tax L296G (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, lanes 3, 8 and 9) activated any of the motifs. These non-identical patterns suggest that Tax may use different contact surfaces to target factors docked at the 21-bp repeats, &#x003ba;B or SRE. We note some similarity in the Tax mutant activity profiles for the 21-bp repeats and SRE suggesting that overlapping surfaces may be utilized.</p></sec><sec><title>Amongst bZIP factors, CREB is specifically preferred by Tax</title><p>Tax activates the HTLV-I LTR through the viral 21-bp repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. When compared to &#x003ba;B and SRE, the activation of 21-bp repeats by Tax is particularly effective (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) and, based on mutant profiles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), relies upon unique structural surfaces. Previously, it has been proposed that bZIP cellular transcription factors including CREB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], ATF4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and c-Jun [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] play roles in Tax activation of 21-bp repeats. However, the relative contribution of these bZIP factors has not been compared directly in the same experimental setting. Furthermore, it remains undetermined whether additional newly identified bZIP proteins may also participate in Tax activation of 21-bp repeats.</p><p>We next used dominant-negative proteins to assess the contributory roles of different bZIP transcription factors on Tax-dependent activation. We employed several well-documented dominant-negative inhibitors of CREB and Jun proteins including KCREB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], A-CREB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], A-Fos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and TAM67 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In addition, we constructed dominant-negative versions of ATF4 and LZIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] using the strategies suggested by Vinson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The dominant-inhibitory activities of the latter two proteins A-ATF4 and A-LZIP were verified using electrophoretic mobility shift assay and CAT reporter assay (data not shown). We interrogated these dominant negative bZIP proteins for inhibition of Tax activation of HTLV-I LTR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). All, KCREB, A-CREB, A-ATF4 and TAM67, suppressed Tax activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, lanes 3&#x02013;10 compared to lane 2). However, different dominant negative inhibitors constructed to the same protein using different strategies might have different potencies. For example, KCREB contains a mutation of a single amino acid in the CREB DNA-binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], whereas A-CREB was constructed by fusing a designed acidic amphipathic extension onto the N terminus of the CREB leucine zipper region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Differential inhibitory effects of KCREB and A-CREB were observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, lanes 3&#x02013;6). In light of this, we quantitated and compared the inhibitory activities of dominant negative proteins all constructed using the same strategy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Since NF&#x003ba;B is not involved in Tax activation of HTLV-I LTR, we included a dominant negative form of IKK&#x003b2;, IKK&#x003b2; DN, as a neutral control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, group 7). When we compared four dominant negative bZIP proteins, A-CREB, A-LZIP, A-Fos and A-ATF4, constructed using the identical molecular strategy, we observed the most dramatic suppression of Tax activation of HTLV-I LTR with A-CREB (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, group 3, red column). The second most significant reduction in activity was seen with A-LZIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, group 6, red column). Thus, although several bZIP proteins can redundantly serve to mediate Tax-activation of the LTR, a clear preference for CREB is revealed by our assay.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Specific preference for CREB by Tax.

This responsiveness of the HTLV-I minimal promoter is compatible with the concept that the core promoter can also be an important determinant of transcriptional specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. We next asked whether all TATAA-elements are recognized by Tax in the same way for purposes of activated transcription. Hence, we constructed reporter plasmids that contain two 21-bp repeats and a minimal TATAA promoter from HTLV-I, HIV-1 or SV40 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Since the TATAA promoters were all placed within the same context, we consider this a valid comparison of their relative responsiveness to Tax activation.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Tax preferentially activates the HTLV-I minimal TATAA promoter.

To further verify the importance of the TATAA-promoter, we asked the same question using a different approach. Above, Tax was recruited presumably to the downstream TATAA-box via factors bound to the HTLV-1 21bp repeats (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). We next investigated whether the same conclusion could be established if a Gal4 DNA-binding domain-Tax fusion protein (Gal4-Tax) was delivered to downstream TATAA element by tethering to upstream Gal4-binding sites (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref> for reporter schematic). For this assay, we tested the HTLV-I, the HIV-1, and the E1b TATAA-elements. Consistent with the results from the 21 bp-TATAA experiments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), Gal4-Tax activated most strongly the HTLV-I TATAA element (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, lane 9 and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>, group 3) and was minimally potent for the adenoviral E1b promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, lane 7 and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>, group 1). As a control for Gal4-Tax, we checked in parallel the activity of the artificial Gal4-VP16 activator. In contrast with Gal4-Tax, Gal4-VP16 showed no preference for the various TATAA elements (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>, lanes 4&#x02013;6 and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). Thus, two lines of evidence here support that the HTLV-I TATAA promoter is an additional Tax-specific responsive element.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>DNA-tethered Tax is specifically active on the HTLV-I minimal promoter.

When observed at such promoters, this finding is evident that those activators act mechanistically to enhance TBP recruitment to the TATAA box. For general transcriptional activation, additional events subsequent to TBP recruitment are also known to be functionally critical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. To date, it remains unclear whether Tax works transcriptionally through a mechanism solely to recruit TBP or whether there are additional mechanistic implications after TBP is recruited to the TATAA-element.</p><p>To investigate the mechanism(s) of Tax function with respect to TBP recruitment, we constructed a series of reporter plasmids (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>) with two copies of 21-bp repeat, five copies of Gal4-binding sites and a minimal TATAA sequence from one of four viral promoters (HTLV-I, HIV-1, SV40 and E1b). We artificially delivered TBP to each promoter by provision of Gal4-TBP, and we asked whether Tax has an additional transcriptional effect which is independent of TBP-recruitment to the TATAA-element. If Tax were to serve only for TBP-recruitment, then when TBP is tethered to the TATAA via Gal4-TBP one should expect to see no transcriptional enhancement from Tax. Provocatively, for both the HTLV-I and HIV-1 TATAA elements, Tax stimulated reporter expression greatly over that already achieved with Gal4-TBP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, groups 1 and 2). Consistent with above findings, the SV40 and E1b TATAA elements appear to be transcriptionally rate-limited by TBP recruitment, and Tax has minimal activity on these promoters. However, the findings from the HTLV-I and the HIV-1 reporters provide evidence that more than simply accelerating TBP recruitment Tax can serve transcriptional function(s) subsequent to TBP (TFIID) assembly at the core promoter. This is the first time that Tax has been shown to have a role subsequent to transcriptional initiation complex formation at the promoter.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Tax further activates a promoter with DNA-tethered TBP.

To date Tax has been considered solely to initiate transcription. Our study shows for the first time that Tax has a transcriptional role after assembly of an initiation complex at the promoter.</p><sec><title>Preferential requirements for 21-bp repeats, CREB, and the HTLV-I TATAA box</title><p>HTLV-I is etiologically associated with adult T-cell leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Expression of Tax leads to immortalization of T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and transformation of rat fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Tax is a transcriptional activator that can interact pleiotropically with several different enhancers. In addition to the HTLV-I 21-bp repeats, &#x003ba;B and SRE elements can also mediate Tax activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Amongst these three enhancers, it is clear that the viral 21-bp repeats are the most highly responsive to Tax-activation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). However, data elsewhere have raised questions as to the identity of the 21-bp binding bZIP factor which is best used to mediate Tax activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In direct comparisons, we have used matched A-CREB, A-Jun, A-ATF4 and A-LZIP dominant negative mutants to ask which bZIP factor is most contributory to Tax activation. In our cell system, a novel bZIP factor called LZIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] can apparently participate in LTR transcription; however, for Tax activation CREB is preferred over ATF4 or c-Jun (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><p>Beyond the requirement for the 21-bp enhancer, our experiments revealed that the HTLV-I TATAA is also specifically preferred by Tax (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). This finding is consistent with the general notion that core promoters can contribute specificity to transcriptional regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Indeed, core promoter preference by other cellular and viral activators such as Sp1, VP16 and Tat have been documented previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. However, the reasons underlying core promoter preferences are poorly understood. TAFs have been suggested to be responsible for the core promoter selectivity of some activators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. In this vein, the interaction of Tax with TBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and TBP-associated factors such as TAF<sub>II</sub>28 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] might provide mechanistic explanations.</p></sec><sec><title>Roles of Tax subsequent to TBP recruitment</title><p>A provocative notion which emerges from our study is that Tax can further activate a promoter at which TBP has already been artificially tethered (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Experiments in yeast and mammalian cells indicate that many genes can be activated through artificial recruitment of TBP and other components of the basal transcription machinery to their promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. In yeast, artificial recruitment of TBP bypasses the effect of DNA-tethered activators whereas the activators fail to activate transcription when physically fused to components of the basal transcription machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. This and other lines of evidence support the notion that activator-dependent recruitment of TBP and basal transcription machinery is a major mechanism for transcriptional activation in yeast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. In contrast, artificial recruitment of TBP to mammalian promoters has not yet been extensively studied. Among the few promoters examined, some such as the ones from E1b and thymidine kinase genes can be fully activated by artificially recruited TBP, while others such as HIV-1 and c-fos promoters are stimulated weakly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. On the other hand, some activators such as VP16, E1A, Tat, E2F1 and IE2 work synergistically with artificially recruited TBP, while others such as Sp1 cannot further enhance the activity of DNA-tethered TBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Thus, artificial recruitment of TBP might insufficiently activate transcription in mammalian cells and different activators might function at different steps with respect to TBP recruitment. Our results indicate that DNA-bound TBP can activate HTLV-I LTR only weakly, but its activity is further enhanced by Tax (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). While such experimental results do not exclude that under physiological circumstances the primary function of Tax may be to enhance initiation complex formation (i.e. TBP-recruitment), they do indicate that Tax has an additional transcriptional activity that extends to phases after transcriptional initiation. Currently, we do not know whether this is at the step of promoter clearance, transcriptional elongation, or some other processes. However, we do believe that Tax should be added to the list of mammalian activators that can function at steps subsequent to TBP recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>All the transcriptional assays in the present study were based on transiently transfected reporters.

Obviously, chromatin structure and copy numbers can account for significant differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].
