DEI challenges include a full spectrum of issues from the lack of, and promotion of, women in science, to the numerous barriers in place that limit representation of African scientists in global scientific efforts. DEI principles in African science remain relatively underdeveloped, with limited engagement and discussion among all stakeholders to ensure that initiatives are relevant to local environments. The Sub-Saharan African Network for TB/HIV research Excellence (SANTHE) is a network of African-led research in HIV, tuberculosis (TB), associated co-morbidities, and emerging pathogens, now based in eight African countries. Our aim, as a scientific capacity strengthening network, was to collaboratively produce a set of DEI guidelines and to represent them visually as a DEI compass. We implemented a consortium-wide survey, focus group discussions and a workshop where we were able to identify the key DEI challenges as viewed by scientists and support staff within the SANTHE network. Three thematic areas were identified: 1. Conquering Biases, 2. Respecting the Needs of a Diverse Workforce (including mental health challenges, physical disability, career stability issues, demands of parenthood, and female-specific challenges), and 3. Promotion of African Science. From this we constructed a compass that included proposed steps to start addressing these issues. The use of the compass metaphor allows &#x02018;re-adjustment/re-positioning&#x02019; making this a dynamic output. The compass can become a tool to establish an institution&#x02019;s DEI priorities and then to progress towards them.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

However, the lack of DEI extends beyond the lack of promotion of women in science, including numerous barriers in place that limit representation of African scientists in global scientific efforts [<xref rid="pgph.0002339.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgph.0002339.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. For African science to truly advance both on the African continent and globally, there needs to be greater efforts to support DEI.</p><p>The Sub-Saharan African Network for TB/HIV research Excellence (SANTHE) is a network of African-led research in HIV, tuberculosis (TB), associated co-morbidities, and emerging pathogens, now based in eight African countries. SANTHE has four major strategic objectives: to produce world-class scientific research that addresses African health and research priorities in HIV/TB and associated morbidities (including SARS-CoV-2); to increase levels of globally competitive African scientists and research groups by supporting the development of a critical mass of scientists at research sites; to increase knowledge translation and exchange processes to ensure optimal research impact; and to strengthen research ecosystems to facilitate high-quality science and supportive, sustainable, and equitable working environments. Our aim in 2021, as a scientific capacity strengthening network then based in 5 African countries (South Africa, Kenya, Botswana, Rwanda and Zambia), was to collaboratively produce a set of DEI guidelines and to represent them visually as a DEI compass. By guidelines, we mean high-level ideas for changes that could be made to address identified issues within SANTHE. We aim for this compass to be used by SANTHE to support initiatives at its associated institutions. SANTHE has started to implement some tools designed based on the suggested solutions identified in our compass. We aim to then share the process and the resulting compass with others, so they might draw inspiration from it to develop their own compasses as part of a commitment towards improving DEI in scientific research ecosystems in Africa. In addition, we hope to use it as a platform to continue the DEI discussion with others, so we share feedback, learning, and suggestions, to improve our approaches and adjust our compasses on a regular basis. Furthermore, as SANTHE has expanded&#x02014;adding research sites in Cameroon, Uganda and Zimbabwe- we are now working on an updated compass to include perspectives from all our sites.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>The Sub-Saharan African Network for TB/HIV Research Excellence (SANTHE) was established in 2015 as a collaborative TB and HIV scientific research and capacity building programme, part of the DELTAS Africa Initiative (<ext-link xlink:href="https://scienceforafrica.foundation/deltas-africa" ext-link-type="uri">https://scienceforafrica.foundation/deltas-africa</ext-link>). At the time these activities- and compass development- took part SANTHE was based at the following sites: the Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI) in Durban South Africa (the lead partner); KEMRI-Wellcome Trust Research Programme (KWTRP) in Kilifi, Kenya; Rwanda Zambia Health Research Group (RZHRG) in Kigali, Rwanda and Lusaka, Zambia; and the Botswana-Harvard AIDS Institute Partnership (BHP) in Gaborone, Botswana. Each site has both junior and senior scientists and support staff supporting SANTHE-associated efforts. SANTHE has since expanded to include the following sites: Centre de Recherche sur les Maladies Emergentes et Re-emergentes (CREMER) in Yaound&#x000e9;, Cameroon; Uganda-Case Research Collaboration (UCRC) at Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda; and the Collaborative Clinical Research Centre (CCRC) at the University of Zimbabwe, Harare, Zimbabwe. As a consortium we wished to better understand the perceived challenges around DEI by our members and start a collaborative process by which we identified potential solutions or directions in which we should move to make SANTHE more DEI-friendly. Our approach to this was to design and implement a cross-consortium survey, perform focus group discussions and facilitate a SANTHE-wide workshop.</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Consortium-wide survey</title><p>In mid- 2021 we sent out a survey across our consortium to gauge the understanding and experiences of DEI in our members&#x02019; scientific careers, targeting both scientific and support staff (survey respondents split by role is displayed in <xref rid="pgph.0002339.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>).

Begin the discussion on what SANTHE could do to address these issues.</p><p>Key questions that the discussions were guided around included: What do we understand by the term &#x02018;equity, diversity and inclusion&#x02019;?; What do we think about diversity, equity and inclusion in science?; Do we have diversity, equity and inclusion concerns for the future of our careers/those of our colleagues?; Are we able to identify key/top areas of concern?; What can SANTHE do to help?. We also discussed some of the challenges raised through the surveys. We hosted two FGDs, both of which were held online, in part due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and in part due to the geographical distribution of participants. There were 22 participants in the first FGD which took part on 29<sup>th</sup> January 2021, 68% of whom were female, and 86% of which were Black. There were 4 support staff members, 5 Masters students, 1 graduate intern, 2 senior scientists, 2 early/mid-career scientists, 5 PhD students and 3 post-doctoral trainees. There were 10 participants in the second FGD (13<sup>th</sup> February 2021), 90% of whom were female. There were 2 support staff members, 3 Masters students, 2 PhD students, 2 post-doctoral trainees and 1 senior scientist. Each FGD lasted just over 60 minutes.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Online workshop</title><p>On 16<sup>th</sup> April 2021 we held a two-hour online DEI workshop using Zoom. The purpose of this workshop was to discuss potential solutions or directions we could consider taking as a consortium to address the challenges that had been raised through the survey and FGDs. The workshop took part in 3 parts: 1. A brief overview of our efforts to date was provided, 2. We highlighted key issues/concerns raised so far, and 3. We had an open discussion on what steps could be taken to address these issues. All SANTHE scientists and support staff were invited to participate, in addition to interested others at our SANTHE-affiliated partner institutions and other key stakeholders who could potentially suggest innovative solutions or who were in a position to help with the implementation of potential solutions. A total of 91 individuals attended the workshop in which we discussed the identified issues and brainstormed what directions and potential solutions could look like. 63% of attendees were female. 24 were support staff members; 20 senior scientists; 5 mid-career scientists; 17 PhD students; 5 post-doctoral researchers; 2 graduate interns; 12 Masters students; 4 unknown; 1 media; and 1 funder.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Inclusivity in global research</title><p>Additional information regarding the ethical, cultural, and scientific considerations specific to inclusivity in global research is included in the <xref rid="pgph.0002339.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Findings</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Overview of survey findings</title><p>21% of those who participated in our survey felt that they were disadvantaged in the workplace, while 18% were unsure (<xref rid="pgph.0002339.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>).

</p></disp-quote></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Key feedback from the FGDs</title><p>The discussions from the FGDs built on the information gained from the surveys. Three themes started to emerge from the FGD conversations. The first was around this idea of &#x0201c;bias&#x0201d; in the workplace- either conscious or unconscious. For example, the strong bias against mothers was raised, the lack of female role models and the need to change the patriarchal structure in science. In addition to gender bias, cultural bias was raised and the perception that science generated from Africa was not respected.</p><p>The second theme that emerged is the need for science/institutions to be more flexible in their approach to better support DEI through greater understanding of the needs of their workforce. For example, concerns were raised about how individuals on the academic career track are treated like trainees and are not provided employee-associated benefits. Individuals also felt that a lack of &#x02018;respect&#x02019; was given to them as they are treated like students and there was a strong feeling of a lack of &#x02018;job&#x02019; security, impacting on mental health. Although this is a global challenge, it is a greater problem in the African setting where many scientists have increased family responsibilities at a younger age. The final theme that started to emerge was around perceived specific barriers for African scientists. For example, funding was perceived to be skewed with scientists in Africa having limited opportunities. Comments were also made regarding other DEI barriers in e.g. <italic toggle="yes">Nature</italic> journals&#x02019; high publication fee that is well beyond the means of most African researchers, and the feeling that everyone should be able to submit their science regardless of how much it costs to publish. Access to journals was also reported to be a key challenge as many journals/journal articles are still not open access.</p><p>These three thematic areas are summarized below with the key issues that were raised under these themes from both the survey and FGDs:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Conquering Biases&#x02014;(including sexual orientation bias, cultural gender-stereotyping bias, race preference, male bias, ageism, imposter syndrome, anti-motherhood sentiments, and socio-economic bias)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Respecting the Needs of a Diverse Workforce&#x02013;(including mental health challenges, physical disability, career stability issues, demands of parenthood, and female-specific challenges)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Promotion of African Science&#x02014;(including a lack of appreciation of African-generated science and scientists, preferential treatment of northern-based scientists and institutions e.g. biased reviews of grants/publications, and structural barriers in science that prevent true diversity such as high publication costs).</p></list-item></list><p>The issues included under these themes are highlighted in <xref rid="pgph.0002339.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A&#x02013;6C</xref> that were generated specifically for this project and then used in the subsequent workshop to communicate key examples of some of the challenges we face as a consortium.</p><fig position="float" id="pgph.0002339.g006"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgph.0002339.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Visual representation of the thematic areas and challenges identified.</title><p>a: Respecting the needs of a diverse workforce.

Drafts of the compass were shared internally and externally, and the feedback was incorporated to create the latest version (<xref rid="pgph.0002339.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>).

Much of the global discussion has focused on the promotion of female scientists and under-representation of certain communities and ethnic and racial groups [<xref rid="pgph.0002339.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgph.0002339.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. DEI principles in Africa science also remain relatively underdeveloped, with limited engagement and discussion among all stakeholders to ensure that initiatives are relevant to local environments [<xref rid="pgph.0002339.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0002339.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0002339.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0002339.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Members of our consortium were motivated to take part in this effort reported here and demonstrated enthusiasm to air their perspectives and contribute to solutions for the challenges identified. We identified three (somewhat overlapping) themes under which most of the issues/challenges raised by members of our consortium fell and around which our current compass is based: conquering biases, respecting the needs of a diverse workforce, and the promotion of African science.</p><p>To start conquering biases we have taken steps to introduce training around unconscious and conscious bias. We have also introduced some tools to help us better respect the needs of a diverse workforce. For example, SANTHE has now introduced Care-Giver support awards that provide funding support to assist individuals who act as caregivers to attend scientific meetings or key trainings. These awards cover the additional costs incurred by the caregiver being away or help cover costs for e.g. for parents to bring their children with them. We have also introduced our Fellowship Interruption Awards which help provide additional funds to cover a break within the Fellowship period e.g. perhaps due to prolonged ill health or maternity/paternity leave. A major issue that emerged from our efforts was the challenge of mental health support for all our scientists. Our consortium&#x02013;and particularly the PhD and post-doctoral trainees&#x02013;had very strong feelings about this key challenge and agreed that more needed to be done to support scientists in what is probably universally acknowledged, not to be the easiest of career paths. The stress and uncertainty of the scientific career pathway, the lack of respect of being perceived as a &#x02018;student&#x02019; even though you have been working for many years, the lack of sufficient locally-based role models and mentors, and the inherent difficulties associated with performing science in Africa were all felt to be major contributors to mental health challenges in our consortium [<xref rid="pgph.0002339.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgph.0002339.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. SANTHE has started to take steps to assist in this area e.g. provided a mini-gender equity award to doctoral trainees in our network to support their own mental health campaign and going forward at a network level we will be providing mental health training and support. Recent events have further highlighted the need for support of this kind with the stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic and specific local challenges such as the 2021 riots and 2022 floods at our Durban, South Africa site.</p><p>There are numerous barriers that limit the representation of African scientists in global scientific efforts and contribute to the continued colonisation of research involving the African continent [<xref rid="pgph.0002339.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This theme of our compass is perhaps the most challenging for us to address (primarily because it requires additional resources that are not readily available in low and middle income settings), and while we intend to do as much as we can at a consortium and individual level&#x02013;we also hope that by promoting our compass and our efforts we may also inspire those in external power positions to make key changes. There is need to promote and normalise African excellence. Promoting DEI in African institutions ensures greater access and representation in research, providing opportunities for talent to emerge in Africa, which in turn yields excellence. A key challenge is a lack of visibility of African scientists and their science in the global context. Even as some funding bodies are reflecting on their approach to supporting research on the African continent, there is a lack of knowledge around what science is currently being performed and who leads it. This lack of engagement with African scientists needs to be tackled, so that there is an increased awareness of who does what and where in Africa by both funders and other scientific stakeholders. Our efforts have highlighted the issue of perceived preferential treatment of northern-based scientists and institutions and this is also reflected in the literature. One way to help disrupt potential biases like this is to try and rebrand African science and her scientists, increasing the visibility of what science looks like in Africa and the importance of the research agenda and activities on the continent being led by Africa. In addition, structural barriers also exist that prevent true diversity in science such as high publication fees and publishing structures that continue to favour Northern-based researchers, challenges obtaining visas for travel to key events (e.g. IAS 2022 Montreal and Health Systems Research 2022 in Bogata that lead to the social media slogan #visaapartheid), and language barriers to participating in an anglophone dominated industry [<xref rid="pgph.0002339.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0002339.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0002339.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0002339.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We identified a range of possible solutions that can be implemented to help contribute to the elimination or reduction in the above challenges and we hope that our compass, and hopefully future compasses that are developed may suggest novel approaches to do this or share best practices so that others can also benefit.</p><p>We acknowledge some limitations with our efforts reported here. Firstly, given the relatively limited number of respondents we did not narrow down the analysis of the DEI issues brought up by the respondents based on their gender, nationality and race. Given the diversity of the cultures of the respondents, it could be that there are country/regional or race specific DEI issues. Secondly, we wish to highlight our awareness of other DEI challenges that are not outlined or highlighted in depth here. For example, we are aware of the importance of the recognition of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) populations. However, these issues were not raised as one of the majority priority areas by individuals in our network who took part in the efforts described here, and we wished to accurately reflect their current perspectives at this point in time. We acknowledge that these perspectives may change over time, and may change when the sample of respondents increases or when new individuals join our network, hence the importance of routinely updating the compass, and in general promoting good DEI practices in all our activities and approaches including the language we use. Since this compass was created we have added new research sites (in Cameroon, Uganda and Zimbabwe) to the SANTHE network and so are now taking steps to renew our compass to also reflect the new voices from our consortium.</p><p>We view the SANTHE compass as a visual commitment to improving DEI within our network. It is not a simple tool&#x02014;with several layers contributing to its complexity. This is in part due to the granularity of people&#x02019;s experiences and the specificity of suggestions, which we believe help move away from action-less platitudes which can be a problem in this space. We aim to update our compass routinely, based on feedback and progress, and ideally hope to add best practices as they develop, to make sure that DEI is embedded in all we do. One challenge we have is that SANTHE is a network and has no direct control over institutional practices and policies at the institutions that are part of SANTHE. However, we believe that by sharing the compass both locally and further afield, advocating for DEI, and contributing to the DEI discussion and landscape, that our efforts will have an impact beyond SANTHE. What was interesting to see was the interest in DEI displayed by individuals within the SANTHE network, with many clearly feeling that they had power to do more at an individual level- both in terms of advocacy and action- to support this key area. We hope that this project will inspire others to perhaps develop their own DEI compasses, and we can continue to learn and share from one another when implementing new approaches in this arena. The use of the compass metaphor allows &#x02018;re-adjustment/re-positioning&#x02019; making this a dynamic output. We encourage institutions to define annual actions aligned with the compass and to assess their achievements against the goals at least annually and hopefully take each goal to the next level or readjust it as necessary. Thus, the compass can become a tool to establish an institution&#x02019;s DEI priorities and then to progress towards them.</p></sec><sec id="sec017" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pgph.0002339.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Details of individuals who completed the survey.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgph.0002339.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pgph.0002339.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Olzmann</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name>. <article-title>Diversity through equity and inclusion: The responsibility belongs to all of us</article-title>. <source>Mol Biol Cell</source>. <year>2020</year>;<volume>31</volume>(<issue>25</issue>):<fpage>2757</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>60</lpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1091/mbc.E20-09-0575</pub-id>
