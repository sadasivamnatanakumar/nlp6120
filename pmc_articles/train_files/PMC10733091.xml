The selected hair fibers donor had refrained from undergoing any form of chemical treatment, including dyeing, relaxing, and bleaching, for a minimum period of six (6) months prior to specimen collection. The isolated single fibers were subjected to uniaxial tensile testing at various strain rates (10<sup>0</sup>.s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>,10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>. &#x00026; 10<sup>&#x02212;4.</sup>s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>).

Curly hair fibers have been recognized as displaying heightened susceptibility to mechanical strain in comparison to straight and wavy fibers <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. This particular hair type exhibits a non-uniform cross-sectional configuration characterized by twists and bends, resulting in constricted cross-sectional areas along the filament length. Consequently, these areas serve as points of vulnerability, as the application of excessive force can engender localized high-stress regions over the diminutive cross-sectional regions of the filament <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Such hair fibers are prevalent within the African population, yet have garnered limited scientific attention. Within the realm of cosmetic literature, investigations pertaining to the potency and flexibility of hair fibers have primarily revolved around mechanical and chemical treatments. It follows that the cosmetic industry could delve further into comprehending the intricate behavior of curly hair, thereby facilitating the development of specialized treatments tailored exclusively for this hair type. This study centers upon evaluating the influence of strain rates on individual curly fibers under both dry and wet conditions, across varying temperatures.</p></sec><sec id="sec0004"><label>3</label><title>Data Description</title><p id="para0011">The shared data describe the mechanical properties of single curly from female individual at her early 30s.

This type of research is important for understanding the behaviour of curly hair fibers and can inform the development of more accurate 3D models for predicting their mechanical properties. By testing hair fibers in both dry and wet conditions, the study may have been able to capture the effects of moisture on the mechanical properties of the hair. The results of this study may help to identify the key factors that influence the mechanical properties of curly hair fibers and inform the development of new approaches to characterizing and modelling their behaviour.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0006"><title>Limitations</title><p id="para0020">The study's foremost limitation is its exclusive concentration on hair samples collected from a single individual of African descent. This restricted focus introduces inherent limitations pertaining to the extent to which the findings can be generalized beyond this specific individual and population group. It's crucial to recognize that human populations are incredibly diverse, and factors such as genetic variations, environmental influences, and cultural practices can significantly impact the characteristics and composition of hair. Therefore, while the study's results provide valuable insights for this specific context, their applicability to broader, more diverse populations may be limited.</p></sec><sec id="sec0007"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p id="para0021">The study was granted ethical approval by the University of South Africa's Research Ethics Committee in the College of Science, Engineering and Technology [Ref: 2021/CSET/SOE/028].</p></sec><sec id="sec0007a"><title>CRediT authorship contribution statement</title><p id="para0021a"><bold>Lebogang Mathebela:</bold> Conceptualization, Methodology, Data curation, Writing &#x02013; original draft, Visualization, Investigation. <bold>Rudzani Sigwadi:</bold> Supervision. <bold>Tetelo Lekwana:</bold> Supervision. <bold>Harry Ngwangwa:</bold> Funding acquisition. <bold>Thanyani Pandelani:</bold> Funding acquisition, Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing. <bold>Fulufhelo Nemavhola:</bold> Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing &#x02013; review &#x00026; editing, Formal analysis.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebibl1"><title>References</title><ref id="bib0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0001"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Loussouarn</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Worldwide diversity of hair curliness: a new method of assessment</article-title><source>Int.
