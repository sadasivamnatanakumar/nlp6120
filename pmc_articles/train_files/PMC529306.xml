Tissue Doppler recordings were acquired in the apical 4-chamber, 2-chamber, and long-axis views.

Yet oxygen supplementation remains first line treatment in cardiovascular disease states such as myocardial infarction and pulmonary oedema.</p><p>Endothelium-dependent vasodilation is reduced in patients with ischemic heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and such patients are believed to have a reduced ability to counteract the circulatory consequences of systemic (air line travel, high altitude stay) and regional (coronary artery stenosis) hypoxia. Spontaneous nocturnal hypoxia with desaturation for hours is a frequent phenomenon in patients with severe coronary artery disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Left atrial, left ventricular (LV), and right ventricular (RV) end-systolic diameter fall during simulated extreme altitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and during moderate altitude exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. There is controversy concerning myocardial performance during hypoxia; improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], no change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. and worsening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] of left ventricular systolic function, have been described. One study looked at diastolic function expressed as E/A ratio and found a reduction with hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Hyperoxia, a condition in which the total oxygen content of the body is increased above that normally existing at sea level, is associated with impairment of cardiac relaxation and increased left ventricular filling pressures in patients with and without congestive heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) objectively derives measurements of contraction and relaxation velocities directly from the myocardium and thus yields information not previously accessible by echocardiography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. We used TDI to study myocardial performance in healthy volunteers and we hypothesized that hypoxia increases and hyperoxia reduces myocardial performance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Seven healthy men, (age 25&#x02013;46 (mean 38) years) completed the study. All subjects were normotensive, non-smokers, on no medication, had a normal left ventricular function by 2-D echocardiography, and had no family history of ischemic heart disease. The local ethical committee approved the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Ventilation system</title><p>We used a system consisting of a ventilator, a gas analyser with pulse oximeter, and a computer. Computer programs control the experimental procedure and continuously collect data from the ventilator and gas analyser [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Echocardiography</title><p>Echocardiography was performed from the apical acoustic window. Tissue Doppler recordings were acquired as digital loops in the apical 4-chamber, 2-chamber, and long-axis views [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. To avoid aliasing, the settings of the ultrasound equipment and colour-coded area were adjusted to obtain the highest possible frame rate. We measured peak strain in the 16-segment left ventricular model and in 3 segments in the right. From the color-coded tissue tracking image, the motion amplitude toward the apex in systole was recorded in each segment. The global systolic contraction amplitude (GSCA) was calculated as the average shortening amplitude of all 16 segments. The peak E velocity was obtained by pulsed Doppler measurements of the mitral inflow at the tip of the mitral leaflets. We further assessed isovolumetric acceleration, TEI index (spectral and TDI), tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary ejection time. The tissue E' velocity was obtained by Tissue Doppler at the lateral mitral annulus. E/E' has been proposed as a tool for assessing LV filling pressures that combines the influence of transmitral driving pressure and myocardial relaxation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The TEI index (spectral or TDI), a combined measure of systolic and diastolic function, was assessed by Doppler time intervals from the mitral inflow and LV outflow tract or the time intervals were obtained by TDI at the lateral mitral annulus. The TEI index was calculated by a-b/b where the time interval "a" was measured from cessation to onset of mitral inflow and the time interval "b" was the duration of the LV outflow velocity profile. To minimize the variability of the measurements, all ECHO recordings were performed and analyzed in a blinded fashion by the same author (P.S.).</p></sec><sec><title>Study protocol</title><p>TDI was performed when the subjects had rested for 15 minutes breathing room air (SpO<sub>2 </sub>97.9 &#x000b1; 0.1 %), after 5 minutes of respiratory equilibrium during hypoxia (SpO<sub>2 </sub>77.6 &#x000b1; 1.2 %), and after 5 minutes of respiratory equilibrium during hyperoxia (SpO<sub>2 </sub>99.0 &#x000b1; 0.2 %). Heart rate was continuously recorded on computer by means of the pulse oximeter. Blood pressure was measured once during each of the three respiratory steady state situations by an automatic blood pressure measuring device based on the oscillometric method.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data are presented as mean &#x000b1; SEM.

The novelty of our findings, when compared to the literature, is the demonstration that longitudinal myocardial function, and thus the function of the subendocardium, is sensitive to moderate changes in inspired oxygen.</p><p>Patients with ischemic heart disease and heart failure frequently encounter hypoxia but the consequences of hypoxia on left ventricular function remain a matter of controversy, in part because of differences in methodology and the measured parameters. In early studies using roentgenkymograms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and dye injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] hypoxia was shown to increase cardiac output at rest despite reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] or unchanged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] stroke volume. The authors explained the increase in cardiac output by increased heart rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] Myocardial blood flow in the left and right ventricles increased at high altitude in dogs studied with radioactive microspheres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and in healthy controls using positron emission tomography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In a study using M-mode echocardiography at high altitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] percent fractional shortening and velocity of circumferential fiber shortening remained normal while LV isovolumetric contraction time shortened. Echocardiography was also employed in a simulated ascent of Mount Everest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and an insignificant increase in fractional shortening and ejection fraction was found. It is generally accepted that right-sided pressures increase with hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] We speculate that the improvement in tissue tracking displacement in our study reflects the systemic vasodilation which is another consequence of hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. On the other hand, RV-systolic function decreased which is likely to be correlated to the increased systolic pulmonary pressure reflecting the increased pulmonary vascular resistance during hypoxia.</p><p>Hemoglobin saturation in healthy persons increase very little from breathing room air to breathing 100% oxygen. Nevertheless, profound cardiovascular effects were found. This is probably because of an anticipated increase in oxygen dissolved into plasma from 0.32% to 2.09% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Hyperoxia is a possible product of oxygen therapy when administered to patients with heart disease during acute illness. Hyperoxia reduces cardiac output as documented with roentgenkymograms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], dye injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]., echocardiography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] heart catheterisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and indirectly by measurement of isometric systolic tension by means of strain gauge in dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Reduced cardiac output with hyperoxia has even been demonstrated in patients with myocardial infarction using dye injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Some of the reduction in cardiac output may be explained by the observation that hyperoxia reduces heart rate as seen in our study and previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] Reduced heart rate is, however, not an entirely consistent finding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] but in these four studies this could be because of high sympathetic tone (stay in a hyperbaric chamber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], acute myocardial infarction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], open heart surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], heart catheterisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]). We found that heart rate increased with hypoxia and decreased with hyperoxia. This might have affected our measures of LV systolic and diastolic function but we consider this unlikely on the basis of our previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] demonstrating that TEI index, strain rate and the tissue tracking was unrelated to heart rate. During hypoxia as well as hyperoxia no change in LV filling pressure was noted as the E/E' ratio was unchanged. The individual parameters in the E/E' ratio are known to be influenced by heart rate but as a ratio it seems independent of heart rate and load conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Therefore, we did not perform any adjustments for heart rate in the evaluation of LV diastolic function.</p><p>Because of the finding of no change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] or a discrete rise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] in blood pressure, a reduction in cardiac output results in an increased systemic vascular resistance during hyperoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] Regardless of the fact that sympathetic tone may be affected by hyperoxia, even after complete sympathetic blockade myocardial contractile force remains reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In the present study both tissue tracking displacement and strain rate worsened during hyperoxia. It seems plausible that this deterioration could be explained by systemic vasoconstriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] increasing afterload.</p><p>In conclusion, hypoxia improves and hyperoxia worsens systolic myocardial performance in healthy male volunteers. TDI measures of diastolic function are unaffected by hypoxia/hyperoxia which support that the changes in myocardial performance are secondary to changes in vascular tone. It remains to be settled whether oxygen therapy to patients with heart disease is a rational treatment that may sometimes be harmful or whether supplemental oxygen consistently results in an overall gain in delivered oxygen.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The study was supported by The Danish Heart Foundation (no 03-1-2-12-22050), the John and Birthe Meyer Foundation, Karen Elise Jensens Fond, the Novo Nordisk Foundation, and the Danish Medical Research Council.</p></sec></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Adams</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name><name><surname>McCredie</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Jessup</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Robinson</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Sullivan</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Celermajer</surname><given-names>DS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Oral L-arginine improves endothelium-dependent dilatation and reduces monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells in young men with coronary artery disease</article-title><source>Atherosclerosis</source><year>1997</year><volume>129</volume><fpage>261</fpage><lpage>269</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9105569</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0021-9150(96)06044-3</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B2"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>HL</given-names></name><name><surname>Sapsford</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Delaney</surname><given-names>ME</given-names></name><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>JG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The effect on the heart of hypoxaemia in patients with severe coronary artery disease</article-title><source>Anaesthesia</source><year>1996</year><volume>51</volume><fpage>211</fpage><lpage>218</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8712318</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B3"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Boussuges</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Molenat</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Burnet</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Cauchy</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Gardette</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Sainty</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Jammes</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Richalet</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Operation Everest III (Comex '97): modifications of cardiac function secondary to altitude-induced hypoxia.
