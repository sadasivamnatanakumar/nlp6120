The specificity of Cas12a has been the subject of extensive investigation both <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and in genome editing experiments. However, <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> studies have often been performed at high magnesium ion concentrations that are inconsistent with the free Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations that would be present in cells. By profiling the specificity of Cas12a orthologs at a range of Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, we find that Cas12a switches its specificity depending on metal ion concentration. Lowering Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration decreases cleavage defects caused by seed mismatches, while increasing the defects caused by PAM-distal mismatches. We show that Cas12a can unwind and bind seed mutant targets more rapidly at low Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, resulting in faster cleavage. In contrast, PAM-distal mismatches cause substantial defects in cleavage following formation of the Cas12a-target complex at low Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. We observe differences in Cas12a specificity switching between three orthologs that results in variations in the routes of phage escape from Cas12a-mediated immunity. Overall, our results reveal the importance of physiological metal ion conditions on the specificity of Cas effectors that are used in different cellular environments.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P3">Cas12a (formerly Cpf1) is the effector protein of type V-A CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-CRISPR associated) immune systems and has been adopted for biotechnology (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Murugan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Paul and Montoya, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Zetsche et al., 2015</xref>). Cas12a is programmed by a guiding CRISPR RNA (crRNA) to bind and cleave a complementary DNA sequence. In CRISPR-Cas immunity, host cells adapt to infection events by acquiring short segments of the foreign genome within a CRISPR array, which subsequently serves as the template for crRNA production (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Lee and Sashital, 2022</xref>). In biotechnological experiments, Cas12a can be programmed with a guide RNA of interest designed by the researcher (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Paul and Montoya, 2020</xref>). In either case, Cas12a binds target DNA based on complementarity between the crRNA and the target strand of the DNA (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Zetsche et al., 2015</xref>). Following DNA binding, Cas12a uses a metal-ion-dependent RuvC nuclease domain to cleave the non-target strand, followed by a conformational change that exposes the target strand to RuvC cleavage (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Cofsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Son et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Stella et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Swarts and Jinek, 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Swarts et al., 2017</xref>). These two successive cleavage events result in double-strand break formation in the target DNA.</p><p id="P4">The specificity of Cas12a and other Cas effectors used for biotechnology has been extensively studied due to their potential for off-target effects (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Kleinstiver et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Murugan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Strohkendl et al., 2018</xref>). Cas12a specificity is dictated by two main factors: the complementarity between the crRNA guide sequence and the DNA target, and the presence of a PAM (protospacer adjacent motif) next to that DNA target (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Zetsche et al., 2015</xref>). DNA-targeting Cas effectors like Cas12a require PAM sequences to facilitate target searching and dsDNA destabilization en route to target binding via crRNA-DNA hybridization (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Sashital et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Semenova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Sternberg et al., 2014</xref>). Following PAM recognition, the crRNA base pairs with the target strand of the DNA, with base pairs in the PAM-proximal &#x0201c;seed&#x0201d; region forming first and base pairs in the PAM-distal region forming last. Mutations in the PAM and seed cause an outsized effect on the ability of Cas12a to bind to a DNA target, resulting in substantial cleavage defects (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Kleinstiver et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Zetsche et al., 2015</xref>). However, Cas12a cleavage can tolerate mismatches between the crRNA and target DNA, especially when these mismatches occur outside of the seed (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Murugan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Strohkendl et al., 2018</xref>). Mismatches in the PAM-distal region often result in incomplete cleavage of the DNA, where only one strand is cleaved, generating a nicked product (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Murugan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P5">The differential effects of mismatch location have consequences on the evolution of bacteriophages that are subject to CRISPR-Cas immunity. When targeted in essential genomic regions, phages primarily evade Cas12a and other DNA-targeting Cas effectors by developing mutations in the PAM or seed (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Deveau et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Schelling et al., 2023</xref>). However, we recently observed that PAM-distal mutants preferentially emerge when a pre-existing mismatch between the crRNA and target is present in the PAM-distal region (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Schelling et al., 2023</xref>). This result was surprising, given that previous <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> studies have shown that Cas12a is tolerant of multiple PAM-distal mutations (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Fu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Murugan et al., 2020</xref>). The discrepancy between these previous <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> studies and our phage escape data suggested that Cas12a specificity may be altered under physiological conditions. In particular, the concentration of free magnesium ions is expected to be lower in bacterial cells (&#x02264;1 mM) than is typically used in <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> studies (5&#x02013;10 mM) (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Froschauer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Tyrrell et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="P6">To address this discrepancy, we profiled the specificity of three well-characterized Cas12a orthologs from <italic toggle="yes">Francisella novicida</italic> (FnCas12a), <italic toggle="yes">Acidaminococcus sp</italic>. (AsCas12a), and <italic toggle="yes">Lachnospiraceae bacterium</italic> (LbCas12a) at a range of Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. Our results reveal a striking specificity switch at low, physiologically-relevant Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration. PAM and seed mutants become more tolerated at lower Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration, while PAM-distal mutants become less tolerated. Improved cleavage of seed mutant targets at low metal ion concentrations is due to increased rates of DNA binding by Cas12a. In contrast, metal ion concentration has little effect on Cas12a binding to PAM-distal mutant targets, and instead impairs the ability of Cas12a to cleave the DNA following target binding. Although we observe the specificity switch for all three orthologs, our results reveal substantial differences in the effects of seed and PAM-distal mismatches on the cleavage activity of AsCas12a in comparison to Lb and FnCas12a. These differences result in marked variability of escaped phage populations that emerge when challenged by each of the three Cas12a orthologs, including the emergence of single PAM-distal escape mutants. Together, our data reveal how alterations to Cas12a specificity under physiological metal ion conditions can determine phage escape outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration affects off-target and collateral Cas12a cleavage</title><p id="P7">Our previous phage escape study revealed that phages with two PAM-distal mismatches to the crRNA preferentially escape Cas12a-mediated immunity in comparison to phages containing a combination of seed and PAM-distal mismatches (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Schelling et al., 2023</xref>). This suggested that two PAM-distal mismatches are far more deleterious to Cas12a cleavage than previous reports on Cas12a specificity have suggested (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Kleinstiver et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Murugan et al., 2020</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">In vitro</italic> cleavage assays using conditions more similar to those found in <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> cells, including using 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> rather than the more typical <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> concentrations of 5&#x02013;10 mM, confirmed that two PAM-distal mismatches could be more deleterious than a combination of a seed and a PAM-distal mismatch (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Schelling et al., 2023</xref>). These results prompted us to re-examine the specificity of Cas12a at a range of Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations.</p><p id="P8">To do this, we used our previously developed <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> plasmid library cleavage assay (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Murugan et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">2021</xref>). In this assay, a Cas12a-crRNA RNA-protein (RNP) complex is used to cleave a negatively supercoiled plasmid library containing target sequences with mutations that introduce mismatches with the crRNA or suboptimal PAM sequences. Following quenching of cleavage, the plasmid library is analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis allowing separation of uncleaved (negatively supercoiled), nicked (relaxed circular), and fully cleaved (linear) sequences. The uncleaved and nicked fractions of the library are extracted from the gel and subjected to PCR to amplify the target region. These amplicons are then sequenced using MiSeq Illumina sequencing to determine which sequences remained uncleaved and which were cleaved only on one strand.</p><p id="P9">We selected two targets derived from gene L and gene W of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> &#x003bb; phage, for which we previously studied escape from FnCas12a-mediated immunity (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Schelling et al., 2023</xref>). We did not observe any major differences in cleavage at 1 and 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> by three Cas12a orthologs for these targets (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1A</xref>, <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">B</xref>). For each target, we created a plasmid library containing all sequences that introduce single-nucleotide deletions or one or two mutations in the PAM or target region and five &#x0201c;spike-in&#x0201d; sequences with unrelated targets as normalization controls for the uncleaved fraction (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, see <xref rid="S11" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). We subjected these plasmid libraries to cleavage by Fn, As and LbCas12a at four Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (1, 2, 5 and 10 mM), collecting two time points at 1 and 30 min (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">D</xref> and <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">E</xref>). We observed that ~20&#x02013;30% of the library remained uncleaved at 1 min and ~5&#x02013;10% remained uncleaved at 30 min (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1D</xref>). Variations in the fraction uncleaved between orthologs and at different Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations were relatively minor. In contrast, we observed a substantial decrease in the amount of nicked DNA as Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration increased, especially for the gene W library for Fn and LbCas12a and for both libraries for AsCas12a (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>, <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1E</xref>). Interestingly, the amount of nicked DNA remained similar between the 1 min and 30 min time points for FnCas12a and LbCas12a, suggesting that some sequences are rapidly nicked by these orthologs, but are never fully cleaved. Nicking of the plasmid libraries suggests that AsCas12a has a metal-ion-dependent second-strand cleavage defect that is more pronounced than for Fn and LbCas12a.</p><p id="P10">Notably, Cas12a also displays &#x0201c;collateral&#x0201d; non-specific DNA degradation activity upon activation by a target sequence (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2018</xref>). We previously observed non-specific nicking of plasmids by both Fn and LbCas12a when activated with a perfectly matching or mismatched target (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Murugan et al., 2020</xref>). However, it is unclear whether non-specific cleavage occurs at lower Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration. We tested whether plasmids containing the perfect gene L and W target could activate LbCas12a for cleavage of an empty plasmid at the four metal ion concentrations used for plasmid library cleavage (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2A</xref>). We observed substantially more nicked DNA at higher Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, but very little at 1 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, suggesting that activated nicking is metal ion dependent. Similarly, both L and W target plasmid libraries could activate Fn and LbCas12a for cleavage of an empty plasmid, with the most nicking observed at the highest Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2B</xref>). Spike-in plasmids in the plasmid library allowed us to account for non-specific nicking of sequences that cannot otherwise be cleaved by Cas12a (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, see <xref rid="S11" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>).</p><p id="P11">We also assessed the ability of all three orthologs to degrade single-stranded DNA upon activation (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2C</xref>). Interestingly, Fn and AsCas12a did not degrade ssDNA at 1 and 2 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, while LbCas12a degraded ssDNA to a lesser degree at lower Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. These results may explain why Cas12a non-specific ssDNA degradation activity was recently shown to have no effect on phage defense (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Marino et al., 2022</xref>), given that this activity is decreased at physiological metal ion concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Dual PAM-distal mutants are enriched in the uncleaved fraction at low Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration</title><p id="P12">Following cleavage of the plasmid library, we next isolated and PCR amplified the uncleaved and nicked fractions and subjected the amplicons to high-throughput sequencing (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>). We determined fraction uncleaved values for each sequence present in the negatively supercoiled fraction (see <xref rid="S11" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). These values were then plotted on heatmaps that enable visualization of the abundance of each mutant sequence in the uncleaved fraction (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Jung et al., 2017</xref>). The full sequence of the PAM and target are represented on each axis of the heatmaps, allowing location of sequences with two mutations by navigating to the corresponding column and row within the heatmap (e.g. a double mutation at the &#x02212;4 and &#x02212;3 position of the PAM would be located at the first column and second row of the heatmap). For each combination of mutant locations, all nine possible mutations are represented as a 3 &#x000d7; 3 array, allowing location of particular double-mutant sequences within the array (e.g. T1A, A2T would be located in the bottom left corner of the 3 &#x000d7; 3 array in the fifth column and sixth row of the heatmap). Single mutation sequences are shown on the diagonal of the heatmaps. Single nucleotide deletions are shown along the x-axis of the heatmaps. While giving information on individual sequences, these heatmaps also allow for facile visualization of overall trends for mutations across the target sequence.</p><p id="P13">We were most interested in comparing differences in fraction uncleaved across Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">B</xref> plots static images of gene L library heatmaps following 1 min of cleavage by FnCas12a at 10 and 1 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>. These heatmaps reveal striking differences in sequences that are enriched in the uncleaved fraction at each Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration. At high Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration, sequences with mutations in the PAM and mutations or deletions in the first 6&#x02013;8 positions of the target are highly abundant in the uncleaved fraction (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). All combinations of mutations containing a mutation at positions &#x02212;2 and &#x02212;3 of the PAM or +1 through +3 of the seed are also highly abundant. Sequences with deletions or mutations in the mid and/or PAM-distal region are mostly depleted from the uncleaved fraction. These results are consistent with previous specificity studies conducted at 10 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, which revealed that mutations in the PAM and seed are far more deleterious that mutations in the mid or PAM-distal region (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Kleinstiver et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Murugan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p id="P14">In contrast, at 1 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, we observe that PAM and seed mutant sequences are substantially less abundant in the uncleaved fraction than at 10 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). While single mutations in the first three positions of the seed caused enrichment in the uncleaved fraction at 10 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, these same sequences are relatively depleted from the uncleaved fraction at 1 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Combinations of mutations within the seed remained highly deleterious at 1 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, but combinations of mutations where one is in the seed and one is in the mid or PAM-distal region were generally tolerated. These results suggest that seed mutations are less deleterious to FnCas12a cleavage at low magnesium concentration. Conversely, we observe a sharp increase in the abundance of double mutants with mutations in the mid and/or PAM-distal region at 1 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>. In particular, mutations at positions 14 through 17 were highly deleterious in combination with each other, or with other mutations in the PAM-distal (positions 18 through 20) or mid region (9 through 13). Similar combinations of mutants were well tolerated at 10 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>. While single deletions in the mid and PAM-distal region were mainly tolerated at 10 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>, deletions through most of the target (positions 1&#x02013;16) were highly deleterious at 1 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Thus, FnCas12a undergoes a substantial change in its specificity at lower magnesium ion concentration, where double mutations and deletions in the mid and PAM-distal region become highly deleterious, while mutations in the seed become less deleterious.</p><p id="P15">Overall, our data yielded 16 heatmaps for the uncleaved fraction per ortholog (4 Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations for two timepoints and two libraries). To simplify viewing of these heatmaps, we created animations for each timepoint and library, in which each frame shows the uncleaved fraction heatmap for a given Cas12a ortholog at each Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). These animations reveal similar trends in the PAM-distal region for all orthologs and both libraries, where several sequences with deletions or mutations in the PAM-distal region are highly abundant in the uncleaved fraction at lower Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. Single nucleotide deletions and double-mutations in the PAM-distal region were abundant even after 30 min cleavage for FnCas12a, especially for the gene W library. The improved tolerance of seed mutations at lower Mg<sup>2+</sup> was also most pronounced for FnCas12a. At 30 min, double seed mutants or sequences containing combinations of PAM and mid/distal mutations were depleted from the uncleaved fraction at lower Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations for both libraries, suggesting a higher tolerance for mutations in both the PAM and seed by FnCas12a at low Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Similar tolerance of double mutants containing seed and PAM mutants was less pronounced at lower Mg<sup>2+</sup> for LbCas12a, and mostly observed following 30 min of cleavage. For AsCas12a, we did not observe substantial differences in the abundance of seed or PAM mutants across Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, suggesting that Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PAM/seed mutation tolerance varies between different Cas12a orthologs.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Mid and PAM-distal mismatches cause incomplete target cleavage at low Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration</title><p id="P16">We observed a significant fraction of nicked DNA in our plasmid library cleavage assays (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">D</xref>, <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">E</xref>).

These heatmaps allow for rapid visualization of the different effects that changes in Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations have across the target sequence. For the gene L target, after 1 min of cleavage by FnCas12a, the most pronounced negative slopes are for sequences with a mutation at positions 1&#x02013;3 of the seed, including both single mutation sequences and sequences with a second mutation in the mid or PAM-distal region (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>).

For Fn and LbCas12a, we again observed positive slopes for some sequences in which single nucleotides in the first few positions of the seed were deleted.

PAM mutations and seed mismatches are more tolerated at low Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration, especially for FnCas12a. In contrast, mismatches in the mid or distal region are less tolerated at low Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration. We next sought to determine what step of the Cas12a target binding and cleavage cycle is most affected by lower Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations for sequences containing seed or PAM-distal mismatches. We chose to further study FnCas12a, which had the most pronounced specificity switch for both seed and PAM-distal mismatched sequences. We measured the rate of cleavage for individual target sequences by initiating the cleavage reaction in two different ways (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). Following Cas12a RNP formation, the RNP was either mixed with DNA in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (initiation with DNA) or the RNP and DNA were mixed and incubated for 30 min prior to the addition of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (initiation with Mg<sup>2+</sup>). When the reaction is initiated by addition of DNA, the rate of nicked or linear product formation is dependent on the rate of both binding and the first or second cleavage event, respectively. In contrast, initiation with Mg<sup>2+</sup> enables measurement of the rate of the two cleavage steps following RNP-DNA binding.</p><p id="P22">We selected a seed mutant (A2T) and a dual PAM-distal mutant (G17T A19G) for further cleavage analysis.

Conversely, we observed slower cleavage for G17T A19G at 1 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> than at 10 mM when cleavage was initiated with DNA. The dual PAM-distal mutant target was also linearized slowly after initial nicking (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4A</xref>), resulting in similar second strand cleavage rates for both mutant targets at the lower Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4B</xref>, bottom).</p><p id="P23">When the DNA targets were pre-bound to Cas12a and cleavage was initiated by adding Mg<sup>2+</sup>, cleavage of the perfectly matching and the A2T mutant target was mostly complete by the first time point (7 s) at both Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4B</xref>). The G17T A19G mutant was also nearly fully cleaved at the first time point when cleavage was initiated with 10 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>. These results indicate that all three DNA constructs were fully bound to the Cas12a RNP prior to initiation of cleavage through the addition of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and that any differences in the rate of cleavage following DNA binding are unmeasurable. Thus, cleavage defects for the A2T mutant target observed upon initiation with DNA can be mainly attributed to DNA binding defects, which are exacerbated at higher Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration.</p><p id="P24">In contrast, we observed marked decreases in the rates of both first- and second-strand cleavage of the G17T A19G mutant when cleavage was initiated with 1 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4C</xref>, <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4B</xref>).

The similar cleavage defect for the pre-bound Cas12a-target complex suggests that DNA binding is not rate determining for Cas12a cleavage of the dual PAM-distal mutant target at low Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration. Instead, steps that occur following DNA binding but prior to cleavage of each strand are slowed at low Mg<sup>2+</sup>, most likely conformational changes that are required to position each strand into the RuvC active site (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Son et al., 2021</xref>). Consistently, while cleavage rate increases at higher Cas12a concentration for the seed mutant target, we did not observe a concentration-dependent change in cleavage rate of the dual PAM-distal mutant target (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4D</xref>, <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4A</xref>, <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4C</xref>).</p><p id="P25">The observation that a higher Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration inhibits Cas12a binding to the seed mutant target is surprising, given that divalent metal ions could electrostatically stabilize protein-nucleic acid interactions.

Indeed, when RNP-DNA binding was initiated in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> prior to addition of Mg<sup>2+</sup> at various time points (see <xref rid="S11" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>), cleavage of the A2T target was even faster than at 1 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4E</xref>, <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4D</xref>).

In particular, for AsCas12a, low Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration had little effect on cleavage of seed mutant sequences, but caused more deleterious second-strand cleavage defects than for Fn and LbCas12a. We next investigated whether these differences in specificity impact what types of mutant phages emerge when challenged by each Cas12a variant. We created a panel of 8 crRNAs targeting different regions of the &#x003bb;<sub>vir</sub> genome and co-expressed each combination of Cas12a ortholog and crRNA in <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> K12.

After infecting triplicate cultures with &#x003bb;<sub>vir</sub>, we sampled the phage population at various time points and PCR amplified the target region of the phage genome. These amplicons were then subjected to high-throughput sequencing to determine whether and which mutants were present in the population following Cas12a-mediated defense.</p><p id="P27">For most AsCas12a and FnCas12a cultures, we observed a period of growth followed by delayed lysis resulting in a low culture density at 12 hr, which is characteristic of emergence of escape mutants in the phage population (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>, <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A</xref>) (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Schelling et al., 2023</xref>). However, we did not observe lysis for at least one replicate of most LbCas12a cultures. These differences may be due to relatively high expression of LbCas12a, as determined by Western blots of cultures expressing the three Cas12a orthologs (<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S5B</xref>).

An overall analysis of the nucleotide diversity present in each phage lysate revealed that challenge by AsCas12a produced the most diverse populations for cultures in which mutant phages emerged (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Heatmaps plotting the locations of mutations across the PAM and seed underscore the diversity of the mutant populations that escaped from AsCas12a, in comparison to both Fn and LbCas12a (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). Single point mutations emerged throughout the PAM and seed when phages were challenged with AsCas12a, but were mainly localized to the most deleterious positions (&#x02212;3 and &#x02212;2 positions of the PAM or positions 1&#x02013;3 of the seed) for Fn and LbCas12a. Although most mutants contained a single nucleotide substitution, we observed some sequences with multiple mutations, including deletion of consecutive nucleotides (gene D for AsCas12a and gene A for LbCas12a) or multiple point mutations that developed over time (gene E for AsCas12a and gene L for LbCas12a, <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S5C</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">D</xref>).</p><p id="P29">Our initial analysis suggested that a broader range of seed mutations could allow for escape from AsCas12a in comparison to Fn or LbCas12a.

To determine whether mutant diversity decreased as a function of Cas12a:target ratio, we performed phage escape assays at a range of multiplicities of infection (MOIs). We selected the gene J target, for which we observed mutations across the PAM and seed region for AsCas12a, but only at positions 2 or 3 of the seed for Fn and LbCas12a (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). We continued to observe diverse mutations across the PAM and seed for AsCas12a across MOIs, while mutations were mainly limited to the most deleterious positions or to PAM-distal deletions for Fn and LbCas12a at most MOIs (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>, <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5E</xref>).

Indeed, for the gene W target, we observed PAM-distal point mutations for the FnCas12a culture (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>). To further test this, we performed an additional 12 phage infection replicates for As and FnCas12a bearing a crRNA against the gene W target. Out of the 12 cultures, 8 lysed for AsCas12a and 5 lysed for FnCas12a. Interestingly, we observed a single point mutation at position 14 for three of these lysed cultures (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5E</xref>).

Cas effectors must rapidly and selectively locate targets in foreign DNA while also allowing some tolerance of mismatches between the crRNA and target to mitigate immune evasion. Here, we show that an additional factor of divalent metal ion availability also tunes the specificity of Cas12a. We find that Cas12a is more tolerant of seed mutations at lower Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration. This increased seed mismatch tolerance is offset by a decreased tolerance for mutations in the PAM-distal region. These results explain our previous observation that PAM-distal mutant phages preferentially emerge upon challenge by Cas12a bearing a distally-mismatched crRNA (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Schelling et al., 2023</xref>). Together, these results strongly suggest that the specificity profile we measured at lower Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration is physiologically relevant and reflects the degree of Cas12a cleavage that would occur against mismatched targets in cells.</p><p id="P32">Seed mismatches cause binding defects due to directional target unwinding, in which mutations that are close to the PAM are encountered early in R-loop formation and can more readily lead to R-loop collapse (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Rutkauskas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Szczelkun et al., 2014</xref>). Consistently, our analysis of Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent Cas12a cleavage revealed that binding is rate limiting for a seed mutant target, and that binding defects are more pronounced at higher Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration. In the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Cas12a bound a seed mutant target relatively rapidly. Notably, in our cleavage assays, we used a negatively supercoiled DNA target plasmid. Negative supercoiling has been shown to improve the ability of DNA-binding Cas effectors to their targets, as well as to off-target sites (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Newton et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Westra et al., 2012</xref>). Our results now reveal the additional role of divalent metal ions, which may decrease the ability of Cas effectors to unwind DNA by increasing the stability of the DNA double helix (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Owczarzy et al., 2008</xref>).

Alternatively, these defects may be due to R-loop instability in the PAM-distal region. Divalent metal ions may help to stabilize the full R-loop when mismatches are present in the PAM-distal region, preventing unwinding of PAM-distal base pairs following non-target strand cleavage (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Cofsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Naqvi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2023</xref>). Overall, our mechanistic studies suggest a model in which Cas12a binding to seed mismatched targets is inhibited by Mg<sup>2+</sup> but can be more readily overcome at low Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration; by contrast, mismatches in the PAM-distal region impair cleavage following target binding at low Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p id="P34">The metal-dependence of Cas effector specificity likely impacts the activity of these enzymes in native immune system settings.

AsCas12a also had the lowest degree of specificity switching for seed mutants due to Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration. These results suggest that differences in Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent specificity may impact the types of mutants that emerge upon challenge by different Cas effectors. We also previously found that phage target sequences are prone to mutagenesis in the PAM-distal region when targeted by Cas12a (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Schelling et al., 2023</xref>), potentially due to recombination-mediated repair following Cas12a target cleavage (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Hossain et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2021</xref>).

Non-specific cleavage by Fn and LbCas12a affects all sequences in the plasmid library, including the spike-in plasmids. Thus, normalization to the spike-in plasmids ensure that only specific cleavage by Cas12a is measured in our assay. Mutant sequences that are uncleaved by Cas12a should have similar abundance to the spike-in sequences.</p><p id="P41">For the spike-in sequences, five oligonucleotides containing the same flanking sequence as the libraries but with a random 24-nt sequence replacing the gene L or W target sequence were designed (Integrated DNA Technologies, <xref rid="SD3" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Data 2</xref>). These oligonucleotides were pooled, and a plasmid library was created as described above for the gene L and gene W oligonucleotide pools.
