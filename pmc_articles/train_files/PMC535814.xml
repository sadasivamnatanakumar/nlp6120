The myeloid scavenger receptor CD36 binds oxidized lipoproteins that accumulate with hypercholesterolemia and mediates their clearance from the circulation and peripheral tissues. Recently, we demonstrated that CD36 also binds fibrillar &#x003b2;-amyloid and initiates a signaling cascade that regulates microglial recruitment and activation.

Pretreatment of cells with A&#x003b2; did not affect subsequent degradation of oxidized lipoproteins, indicating that lysosomal accumulation of A&#x003b2; did not disrupt this degradation pathway. Using mice with targeted deletions of the scavenger receptors, we demonstrated that A&#x003b2; inhibited oxidized lipoprotein binding and its subsequent degradation via CD36, but not SRA, and this was independent of A&#x003b2;-CD36-signaling. Furthermore, A&#x003b2; treatment decreased CD36, but not SRA, mRNA and protein, thereby reducing cell surface expression of this oxLDL receptor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Together, these data demonstrate that in the presence of &#x003b2;-amyloid, CD36-mediated clearance of oxidized lipoproteins is abrogated, which would promote the extracellular accumulation of these pro-inflammatory lipids and perpetuate lipid peroxidation.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Hypercholesterolemia is an established risk factor for atherosclerosis and a number of recent epidemiological studies have suggested a link between increased circulating cholesterol levels and Alzheimer's disease (AD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Lipoproteins in the serum and the central nervous system (CNS) mediate cholesterol homeostasis through the delivery and removal of cellular cholesterol. With hypercholesterolemia, these phospholipid and cholesterol rich-particles accumulate abnormally outside the arterial lumen, where they are susceptible to oxidization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Lipoprotein-derived oxidation products (hydroperoxides, lysophosphatidylcholine, oxysterols and aldehydes) initiate the inflammatory response that drives atherosclerotic plaque formation in the artery wall, and these lipid peroxidation products, including malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonal (HNE), have also been detected in AD-affected brains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. AD patients have been reported to have cholesterol profiles known to be pro-atherosclerotic, including increased total serum and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and increased susceptibility to lipoprotein oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Antibodies raised against oxidized LDL (oxLDL) demonstrate reactivity to amyloid plaques and surrounding tissue, indicating that lipid peroxidation epitopes present in oxLDL accumulate in the brains of AD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Recently, oxidized cholesterol metabolites identified in both atherosclerotic and senile plaques have been found to accelerate &#x003b2;-amyloid fibril formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Together, these findings suggest that, as in atherosclerosis, the accumulation of lipoprotein oxidation products in Alzheimer's disease may contribute to chronic inflammation.</p><p>Phagocyte expressed pattern recognition receptors (PRR) are the first line of defense of the innate immune system against foreign or modified proteins and lipids. Scavenger receptors are pattern recognition receptors that bind and internalize a wide range of ligands, including certain polyanions, modified forms of LDL, advanced glycation endproducts and apoptotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. These receptors are expressed by macrophages and microglia, and are the primary clearance pathway for pro-inflammatory oxidized lipoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In addition to binding oxLDL, several members of the scavenger receptor A (SRA) and B (CD36, SR-B1) class recognize fibrillar &#x003b2;-amyloid (A&#x003b2;), which accumulates in the brain and cerebral blood vessels in AD, as well as in coronary atherosclerotic plaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. While studies in <italic>Sra </italic>null mice have failed to show a role for this receptor in the pathogenesis of AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], it has recently been demonstrated in our lab, and others, that A&#x003b2; activates an inflammatory signaling cascade via CD36 that regulates microglial activation and recruitment in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In AD patients, increased CD36 expression was detected in the frontal cortex which correlated with the presence of amyloid plaques and oxidative markers, suggesting that upregulation of this scavenger receptor pathway may also promote inflammation <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Similar to its role in peripheral macrophages, CD36 on microglia is believed to scavenge modified proteins and oxidized phospholipids. We hypothesized that a simultaneous increase in lipoprotein oxidation and accumulation of A&#x003b2; in the brain and blood vessels in AD might compromise the ability of this scavenger receptor to effectively clear these modified host ligands.</p><p>A&#x003b2; has previously been shown to reduce uptake of LDL modified by acetylation, in microglia and SRA- or SR-B1-transfected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We have shown that CD36 binds acetylated LDL with very low affinity, indicating that these studies primarily addressed the impact of A&#x003b2; on Class A scavenger receptor activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Unlike SR-A, which binds the modified apolipoprotein B component of acetylated LDL, CD36 recognizes oxidized phospholipids within the oxidized lipoprotein particle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. CNS lipoproteins isolated from cerebrospinal fluid, astrocytes or microglia, contain similar amounts of phospholipid, cholesterol, and cholesteryl ester content as their serum counterparts, and a pro-oxidative environment in Alzheimer's disease is believed to accelerate the formation of lipid peroxides in these particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In this study, we assessed the impact of A&#x003b2; on the binding and degradation of oxLDL via CD36, SR-A and CD36/SR-A-independent pathways. The availability of mice genetically deficient in <italic>Sra </italic>and <italic>Cd36 </italic>has facilitated studies to discriminate the actions of these individual scavenger receptors. We show that A&#x003b2; dose-dependently inhibits oxLDL binding, lysosomal degradation and cholesterol ester accumulation in macrophages and microglia. This inhibitory effect was mediated specifically via CD36 and could be reversed by removal of extracellular A&#x003b2;, indicating that the lysosomal degradation pathway was not directly impaired. Furthermore, activation of CD36-signaling by A&#x003b2; did not mediate this inhibitory effect, as targeted inactivation of essential downstream kinases did not restore oxLDL degradation. Together, these data demonstrate that A&#x003b2; impairs the ability of CD36 to scavenge oxidized lipids by competing for receptor binding. This suggests that accumulation of A&#x003b2; in the brain and vessel wall in AD would inhibit the clearance of pro-inflammatory oxidized phospholipids and oxidized-phospholipid-containing particles such as lipoproteins, thereby promoting lipid peroxidation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>&#x003b2;-Amyloid</title><p>A&#x003b2;<sub>1-42 </sub>and reverse A&#x003b2;<sub>42-1 </sub>(<italic>rev</italic>A&#x003b2;) peptides were obtained from Biosource International (Camarillo, California).

LDL was diluted to 250 &#x003bc;g/ml, dialyzed against PBS at 4&#x000b0;C to remove EDTA, and then dialyzed against 5 &#x003bc;M CuSO<sub>4 </sub>in PBS at 37&#x000b0;C for 6 or 10 h. Oxidation was terminated by the addition of 50 &#x003bc;M butylated hydroxytoluene and 200 &#x003bc;M EDTA and oxLDL was used within 2 days of preparation. Moderately oxidized LDL (6 h oxidation) had a relative electrophoretic mobility of approximately 2.5&#x02013;3 times that of native, unmodified LDL, whereas extensively oxidized LDL (10 h oxidation) had a relative mobility four times that of native LDL.</p></sec><sec><title><sup>125</sup>I-OxLDL degradation, binding and uptake assays</title><p>Measurement of <sup>125</sup>I-oxLDL binding, degradation and uptake was performed on confluent monolayers of peritoneal macrophages (7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>) and microglia (5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>) in 24 well plates as we previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Briefly, 10 &#x003bc;g/ml of <sup>125</sup>I-oxLDL was added to cells in the presence or absence of 30-fold excess unlabeled oxLDL, native LDL, A&#x003b2;<sub>1-42</sub>, or <italic>rev</italic>A&#x003b2; peptide for 5 h at 37&#x000b0;C. To measure <sup>125</sup>I-oxLDL degradation, media were removed and assayed for TCA-soluble non-iodide degradation products. To measure <sup>125</sup>I-oxLDL binding in the presence A&#x003b2;<sub>1-42 </sub>or <italic>rev</italic>A&#x003b2;, cells were washed 3x with 50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 0.15 N NaCl and 2 mg/ml BSA, 1x with 50 mM Tris pH 7.4 and 0.15 N NaCl and treated with 0.4% dextran sulfate to release surface bound <sup>125</sup>I-oxLDL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. To measure <sup>125</sup>I-oxLDL uptake, cells were washed 3x in 50 mM Tris pH 7.4 and 0.15 N NaCl, lysed in 0.1 N NaOH and assayed for <sup>125</sup>I and cellular protein content. In some experiments, cell-association of oxLDL (cell-surface bound and endocytosed oxLDL) was measured by omitting the dextran sulfate treatment. Cellular protein content was measured by BCA assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and degradation, binding and uptake activity are expressed as ng <sup>125</sup>I-oxLDL/mg protein. Specific degradation was calculated as the difference of total cellular degradation of <sup>125</sup>I-oxLDL in the presence and absence of 30-fold excess unlabelled oxLDL competitor.

Cholesterol ester accumulation was assessed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and oil red O staining as we previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. For GC-MS analysis, lipids were extracted with hexane:isopropanol (3:2) and stigmasterol (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri) was added as an internal standard. Lipid extracts were washed once with water and divided equally. One lipid aliquot was saponified for determination of total cholesterol and the second aliquot analyzed for free cholesterol using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The samples were injected (splitless) into an Agilent 6890 GC-MS-(G2613A system, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) equipped with a J&#x00026;W DB17 fused silica capillary column (15 m &#x000d7; 0.25 mm inner diameter &#x000d7; 0.5 &#x003bc;m; J&#x00026;W Scientific, Folsom, CA). The GC temperature program was as follows: the initial temperature was 260&#x000b0;C for 5 min, then increased to 280&#x000b0;C (5&#x000b0;C/min) and held 280&#x000b0;C for 11 min. A model 5973N mass-selective detector (Agilent Technologies) was used in scan modes to identify the samples. Cholesterol measurements were made in triplicate and normalized to cellular protein content. Cholesterol ester content was calculated by subtracting free cholesterol from total cholesterol measured after saponification. To assess neutral lipid accumulation, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with oil red O for 30 min. Staining was recorded on an Olympus X10 microscope equipped with a digital camera.</p></sec><sec><title>Real time RT-PCR analysis</title><p>Total RNA was extracted using Trizol B reagent and real-time quantitative RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) was performed using the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, CA) as we previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].

To address whether CD36 signaling inhibits cellular oxLDL degradation, we used macrophages with targeted deletions in two kinases in this pathway, Lyn and Fyn, which have previously been shown to be required for CD36-mediated p44/42 activation, MCP-1 secretion and ROS production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].

Furthermore, treatment of macrophages with the general phosphotyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein did not reverse A&#x003b2;<sub>1-42 </sub>inhibition of <sup>125</sup>I-oxLDL degradation, confirming that phosphotyrosine kinase signaling does not mediate this effect of A&#x003b2;<sub>1-42 </sub>(data not shown).

However, despite a doubling of oxLDL degradation in <italic>Fyn</italic><sup>-/- </sup>macrophages, this process was still inhibited by A&#x003b2;<sub>1-42 </sub>by up to 90%. Together, these experiments suggest that A&#x003b2;<sub>1-42 </sub>inhibition of oxLDL metabolism is not the result of CD36-Lyn/Fyn signal transduction and support the hypothesis that A&#x003b2;<sub>1-42 </sub>competes for oxLDL binding to CD36.

Lipoprotein particles are especially vulnerable to free-radical mediated lipid peroxidation and the resulting peroxy fatty acids are highly unstable, readily decomposing to form peroxy and alkoxy radicals that further promote oxidation. This self-propagating cycle of lipid peroxidation is particularly damaging in lipid-rich tissues such as the brain, and as a result, the innate immune system has evolved mechanisms to rapidly recognize and clear oxidized lipids. The myeloid scavenger receptors are the first lines of defense against these non-native lipids, as well as modified host proteins such as &#x003b2;-amyloid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. This dual responsibility prompted us to evaluate whether macrophages and microglia would be compromised in their ability to metabolize oxidized lipoproteins in the presence of A&#x003b2;. We found that fibrillar A&#x003b2; specifically inhibited all phases of oxLDL metabolism, including binding, uptake, degradation and accumulation of cellular cholesterol ester. This was mediated by a selective inhibition of CD36 binding by A&#x003b2;, as well as a decrease in CD36 mRNA and protein expression. However, inhibition of oxLDL metabolism was independent of the recently identified A&#x003b2;-CD36-signaling cascade, as targeted inactivation of essential downstream kinases did not restore cellular oxLDL degradation. Together, these data demonstrate that oxidized lipoprotein metabolism by CD36 is profoundly impaired in the presence A&#x003b2;, and suggest that accumulation of A&#x003b2; in the brain and blood vessels in AD would foster the extracellular persistence of these pro-inflammatory lipids, thereby perpetuating lipid peroxidation. Thus, A&#x003b2; binding of CD36 in the brain would promote inflammation via two specific mechanisms: (1) through its engagement of signal transduction and microglial recruitment, and (2) through its abrogation of this important clearance pathway for oxidized phospholipid-containing ligands.</p><p>In addition to CD36, two other scavenger receptor family members have been shown to be expressed in the brain and to bind A&#x003b2;. The Class A scavenger receptors, SRA I and II, and the class B SR-BI are expressed by neonatal microglia, but unlike CD36, these receptors are not expressed by microglia in the normal adult brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, microglial expression of SRA is increased during AD, and this receptor can mediate both adherence to A&#x003b2; and its phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In Sra<sup>-/- </sup>mice, there is a 60% impairment in microglial binding of A&#x003b2; and reactive oxygen production, however, AD-associated brain pathology is not reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. SRA ligands, including acetylated LDL and fucoidan, reduce A&#x003b2; uptake by microglia, however these ligands may also affect other receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Conversely, A&#x003b2; and its soluble precursor protein, sAPP&#x003b1;, inhibit macrophage and microglial uptake of acetylated LDL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. While acetylated LDL is not believed to occur physiologically, other modifications of LDL, such as oxidation, that allow binding to SRA may also be competed by A&#x003b2;. However, in our assays A&#x003b2; inhibition of oxLDL binding and degradation did not occur via this pathway, similar effects were seen in wild type and Sra<sup>-/- </sup>cells. By contrast, the effect of A&#x003b2; was abolished in the absence of CD36, indicating that this receptor is the target of A&#x003b2; action.</p><p>The difficulty in isolating human lipoproteins from the CNS has limited their experimental use, however, several groups have shown that oxidized serum lipoproteins, including LDL, HDL and VLDL, are toxic to neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and both oxLDL and oxidized CSF lipoproteins disrupt neuronal microtubule organization, a pathogy characteristic of the AD brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Thus, the loss of CD36-mediated oxidized lipoprotein clearance in the presence of A&#x003b2;<sub>1-42 </sub>would be predicted to foster inflammation and tissue injury. While we have shown that A&#x003b2; blocks CD36 binding of oxLDL, and its subsequent degradation, we would predict that similar results would be found with oxidized lipoproteins isolated from the CNS, astrocytes or microglia. Although serum and brain lipoprotein particles differ in their apolipoprotein composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], they contain similar amounts of cholesterol, cholesterol ester and phospholipid. CD36 has been shown to recognize a phospholipid moiety of oxidized lipoproteins, primarily oxidized phosphatidylcholine, which is abundant in CSF lipoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The presence of a pro-oxidant environment in AD would be expected to generate similar modifications of CSF lipoproteins and lipoproteins isolated from AD-affected individuals have, in fact, been shown to be more susceptible to oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Inhibition of the primary clearance pathway for oxidized lipoproteins would be predicted to promote inflammation and persistence of lipid peroxidation.</p><p>Disruption of oxidized lipoprotein metabolism by A&#x003b2; may also be relevant in the context of atherosclerosis. Cholesterol oxidation products generated during the inflammatory component of atherosclerosis have been shown to accelerate &#x003b2;-amyloid fibril formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Furthermore, a recent study identified A&#x003b2; advanced human atherosclerotic plaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Our data suggests that the presence of A&#x003b2; in the artery wall may both prevent macrophage oxidized LDL uptake via CD36, thereby promoting &#x003b2;-amyloid fibril formation and activating CD36-signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. It has recently been shown that A&#x003b2;-CD36-signaling leads to the expression of cytokines and chemokines, including IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF&#x003b1;, MCP-1, MIP-1&#x003b1; and &#x003b2; and MIP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Activation of this signaling cascade would be predicted to promote inflammation, as well as atherosclerotic plaque progression. Indeed, overexpression of a mutant human amyloid &#x003b2;-precursor protein in an atherosclerosis-susceptible mouse strain (B6Tg2576) led to significantly increased levels of atherosclerosis, which correlated positively with cerebral A&#x003b2; deposits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Of particular interest, when these mice were maintained on a normal chow diet that did not induce atherosclerosis in wild type littermates, B6Tg2576 mice developed early atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic root, suggesting that A&#x003b2; promotes atherogenesis. The convergence of risk factors for AD and atherosclerosis suggest that these chronic inflammatory diseases may have overlapping mechanisms of pathogenesis in which cholesterol levels and lipid peroxidation play a central role.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations used</title><p>A&#x003b2;, &#x003b2;-amyloid peptide 1&#x02013;42; ACAT, acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase; AD, Alzheimer's disease; CSF, cerebral spinal fluid; DMEM, Dubelcco's modified Eagle medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; fA&#x003b2;, fibrillar A&#x003b2;; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry HNE, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal; oxLDL, oxidized low density lipoprotein; <italic>rev</italic>A&#x003b2;, reverse &#x003b2;-amyloid peptide 42-1; SRA, scavenger receptor A; SR-BI, scavenger receptor B I.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>VVK performed the measurements of <sup>125</sup>I-oxLDL binding, uptake and degradation, and participated in the design of the study and analysis of results.
