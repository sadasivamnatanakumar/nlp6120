The sizes and structure of the particles were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The size of the particles was in the range between 9.7 and 56.4 nm. Cholesterol oxidase (CHO) was successfully bound to the particles via carbodiimide activation. FTIR spectroscopy was used to confirm the binding of CHO to the particles. The binding efficiency was between 98 and 100% irrespective of the amount of particles used. Kinetic studies of the free and bound CHO revealed that the stability and activity of the enzyme were significantly improved upon binding to the nanoparticles. Furthermore, the bound enzyme exhibited a better tolerance to pH, temperature and substrate concentration. The activation energy for free and bound CHO was 13.6 and 9.3 kJ/mol, respectively. This indicated that the energy barrier of CHO activity was reduced upon binding onto Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>nanoparticles. The improvements observed in activity, stability, and functionality of CHO resulted from structural and conformational changes of the bound enzyme. The study indicates that the stability and activity of CHO could be enhanced via attachment to magnetic nanoparticles and subsequently will contribute to better uses of this enzyme in various biological and clinical applications.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Magnetic materials have been used with grain sizes down to the nanoscale for longer than any other type of material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This is attributable to a number of factors including a large surface area to volume ratio and the possibility of immobilizing a biological entity of interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In the last decade increased investigations and development were observed in the field of nanosized magnetic particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Here the term nanoparticles is used to designate particulate systems that are less than 1&#x003bc;m, and effectively below 500 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Due to their magnetic character, magnetite (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) nanoparticles can be attracted by a magnetic field and are easily separable in solution. Similarly, substances to which they have been attached can be separated from a reaction medium, or directed by an external magnetic field to site specific drug delivery targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Magnetic nanoparticles have been widely used in the immobilization of many bioactive substances such as proteins, peptides, enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Magnetite is one of the most commonly used magnetic materials because it has a strong magnetic property and low toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The binding of magnetic particles to bioactive substances involves a number of interactions including the interactions between organic ligand, and the interactions between the amino acid side chains of proteins and the metals centers. Such bindings pave the way for the coupling of biomolecular entities of enhanced stability. Recently reported work in the area of enzyme immobilization has described the catalytic activity of yeast alcohol dehydrogenase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and lipase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] directly bound to magnetite nanoparticles, via carbodimiide activation without the use of a ligand. This binding method offers tremendous scope because of its simplicity and high efficiency.</p><p>Cholesterol oxidase is a flavin-enzyme (with a FAD prosphetic group) that produces hydrogen peroxide according to the reaction 1.</p><p><italic>Cholesterol </italic>+ <italic>O</italic><sub>2 </sub>&#x02192; 4 - <italic>Cholesten </italic>- 3 - <italic>one </italic>+ <italic>H</italic><sub>2</sub><italic>O</italic><sub>2</sub>&#x000a0;&#x000a0;&#x000a0;(1)</p><p>The structure of cholesterol oxidase reveals deeply buried active sites occupied by water molecules in the absence of its substrate steroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Cholesterol oxidase is industrially and commercially important for application in bioconversions for clinical determination of total or free serum cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and in agriculture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Its activity can be determined by following the appearance of the conjugated ketones, the formation of hydrogen peroxide in a coupled test with peroxidase, or by measuring the oxygen consumption polarographically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Several studies on its kinetic properties have appeared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. More recently, Cholesterol biosensor based on entrapment of cholesterol oxidase in a silicic sol-gel matrix at a Prussian Blue modified electrode has been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, this method of enzyme immobilization raises concerns on reduced surface area for enzyme binding and pore-diffusion resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Immobilization of enzymes onto inorganic material surfaces is of vital importance in enzymatic reactions, especially in biosensor applications. Information on the activity and availability of cholesterol oxidase bound to Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>magnetic nanoparticles will contribute to the basic understanding of its activity and function.</p><p>The present study proposes to investigate the direct binding of cholesterol oxidase to Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>magnetic nanoparticles. The sizes and structure of the nanoparticles were characterized using TEM and FTIR spectroscopy. The stability, activity, and kinetic behavior of bound cholesterol were also examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussions</title><sec><title>Particle size and structure</title><p>TEM micrographs of "bare" magnetic nanoparticles and CHO-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>. The "bare" particles were very fine with a diameter ranging from 9.7 to 56.4 nm. The size of the particles after binding to CHO was globally the same as the "bare" particles. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows the size distribution of the particles. However, some spots of agglomerated particles were visible as seen in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>. These agglomerates cause an increase in maximum particle size. The overall sizes of the particles after binding to magnetic nanoparticles were between 9.7 and 166 nm suggesting a perceptible agglomeration in association with the binding process. A possible explanation is that the binding of magnetic nanoparticles was not only a monomolecular process but may involve the binding of several CHO molecules on a single Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>particle. It could also be envisaged that CHO molecules formed aggregates to bind several magnetic nanoparticles. Another possible factor in the agglomeration process is the centrifugation process involved in the separation of the supernatant from the Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-CHO. It is obvious that the centrifugation tend to bring particles together as a compact material. The effect of agglomeration at this stage can be reduced by separating the Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-CHO by an external magnetic field. Since the particles are released after removal of the magnetic field, they may fall separately apart from each other, and are less likely to agglomerate.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Transmssion Electron micrographs of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>magnetic nanoparticles (a) and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-CHO (b).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1477-3155-3-1-1"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Distribution of the particle sizes on the electron micrographs.

It was found that the percentage of cholesterol oxidase bound was between 98 and 100%, irrespective of the amount of particles. The amounts of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>nanoparticles used were 14.4, 17.2 and 20 mg/mL, corresponding to CHO/Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>weight ratios of 0.01, 0.08 and 0.007, respectively. These results show that in all the binding operations, there were sufficiently available amount of particles to bind the enzymes till complete saturation. In a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], it was found that increasing the amount of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>nanoparticles, that is reducing the weight ratio of CHO to Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>below 0.033 caused an increase in lipase binding up to 100%. This was not observed in this study, possibly because of the difference in the binding mechanism, due to differences in the structure of the enzyme. However, the percentage of bound CHO (98&#x02013;100%) shows that the binding process was successful.</p></sec><sec><title>Binding confirmation</title><p>The binding of CHO to magnetic nanoparticles was confirmed by FTIR analysis. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> (a, b, and c) shows the FTIR spectra for "bare" Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-CHO, and CHO in water, respectively. A characteristic band of NH<sub>2 </sub>was observed at 1618 cm<sup>-1 </sup>in the "bare" Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>nanoparticles. The NH<sub>2 </sub>group can be associated with NH stretch at 3400 cm<sup>-1 </sup>which is not visible here, because of a possible hindrance by OH stretch from water. However, this band was not apparent in the spectra of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-CHO suggesting that the binding of CHO to the nanoparticles involved this amino group and the carboxylic groups of CHO after being activated by Carbodiimide, as suggested by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Peaks at 3032 cm<sup>-1 </sup>and 1445 cm<sup>-1 </sup>are more visible in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref> (bare particles) and perceptible in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref> (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-CHO) and could be assigned to traces of residual ammonium hydroxide. The characteristic bands of proteins at 1647 and 1541 cm<sup>-1, </sup>and 1645 and 1541 cm<sup>-1</sup>, in the spectra of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-CHO, and CHO, respectively shows that cholesterol oxidase was effectively present in the samples, confirming the binding of cholesterol oxidase to Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>nanoparticles. The negative peak at 3400-2799 cm<sup>-1 </sup>is possibly due to a reduced amount of water in the sample compared to the water used for background subtraction. The characteristic bands of proteins in the Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-CHO spectra were very weak compared to those in the spectra of cholesterol oxidase in water. The weakness of the peaks is due to the limited amount of CHO bound to the nanoparticles, in comparison to the amount dispersed in water.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>FTIR spectra of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>magnetic nanoparticles (a) in nanopure water and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-CHO (b), and pure CHO (c) prepared in phosphate buffer and then dissolved in nanopure water for FTIR analysis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1477-3155-3-1-3"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Cholesterol oxidase activity and binding kinetics</title><p>The kinetic parameters of the enzymatic reactions estimated by the Lineweaver-Burk plots of the initial rates of cholesterol oxidase from experimental data are presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. The Michaelis-Menten constants <italic>V</italic><sub>max </sub>and <italic>K</italic><sub>m </sub>for CHO were determined to be 0.67 &#x003bc;mol/min mg and 2.08 mM for the free enzyme and 1.64 &#x003bc;mol/min mg and 0.45 mM for the immobilized enzyme, respectively. The <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub>value of the bound CHO was 2.4 fold higher than that of the free, and the <italic>K</italic><sub>m </sub>value of the bound CHO was 4.6 fold lower than that of the free CHO. The low <italic>K</italic><sub>m </sub>reflects the high affinity to substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The high affinity of the enzyme to the substrate may be explained by the fact that when binding onto the surface of the nanoparticles, the enzyme rearranged itself to present a better conformation. Since the secondary and tertiary structure of cholesterol oxidase play important roles in its activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], the rearrangement in structure and conformation may result in better availability of its active sites. The increase in affinity of the enzyme to the substrate upon binding to Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>nanoparticles contributed to an enhancement of the activity of the enzyme.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Lineweaver Burk plots of the initial rates of CHO (&#x025a0;) and (&#x025c6;) Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-CHO at pH 7.4, from experimental data.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1477-3155-3-1-4"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Effect of pH</title><p>The effect of pH on the activities of the free and bound CHO was investigated in the pH range of 6&#x02013;8.5 at 25&#x000b0;C and presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. In the pH range between 6 and 7.4 the activities of the free and bound CHO were quite similar and reached a maximum at pH 7.4. The activity then decreased from pH 8 to 8.5. In this range, the activity of the bound CHO was much higher than its free counterpart. This shows that the bound enzyme showed better tolerance to the variation of solution pH. The similarities in these activities in the pH range of 6 to 7.4 indicate that in these conditions, CHO did not suffer from any major activity constraint. Rather, this pH range appears to be suitable for CHO activity. It is well known that the ability of the amino acids at the active sites of the enzyme to interact with the substrate depends on their electrostatic state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The decrease in activity observed at pH 8 and 8.5 shows that CHO faces some limitations as the pH increased toward more alkaline conditions. If the pH is not appropriate, the charge on one or all of the required amino acids is such that cholesterol can neither bind nor react properly to produce 4-cholesten-3-one.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Effect of pH on the activities of free (&#x025a0;) and bound CHO (&#x025c6;).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1477-3155-3-1-5"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Thermal stability</title><p>The thermal stability of free and bound CHO was investigated after 40 min of storage in the temperature range of 25&#x02013;70&#x000b0;C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). There was no apparent change in activity in the free CHO as well as in the bound CHO, in the temperature range of 25&#x02013;37&#x000b0;C. Above this temperature range, the residual activity decreased in both systems. However, the bound CHO showed higher retained activity than the free CHO. The remaining activity at 60&#x000b0;C was about 2 fold that of the free CHO. This proved that the thermal stability was significantly improved upon binding of CHO to magnetic nanoparticles. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> shows the inactivation rates constants (<italic>k</italic>) at temperatures where the inactivation experiments were observed. The rate constants increased with increasing temperature and were higher for the free CHO than for bound CHO. As stated above, the binding to nanoparticles suggests a better resistance of the enzyme to temperature. We hypothesize that the bound enzyme could possibly undergo a conformational change and a spatial rearrangement that could slow down the folding process and denaturation of the enzyme.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Thermal stability of free CHO (&#x025a0;) and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-CHO (&#x025c6;) at pH 7.4.

It can be observed that at 37&#x000b0;C, the enzyme retained its activity for about 80 minutes before showing a slight decrease. At 50&#x000b0;C the activity decreased continuously to 35% after 110 min. A more severe decrease in activity occurred at 60 and 70&#x000b0;C, resulting in a complete loss of activity after 60 and 70 min, respectively. The decrease in activity may be attributed to a dramatic change in the structure of the enzyme that hindered the availability of the active sites, with a possible denaturation of the enzyme itself. The effect of temperature on the activities of free and bound CHO at pH 7.4 are displayed in the Arrhennius plots (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Only temperatures (50, 60 and 70&#x000b0;C) at which perceptible changes in activity were observed were studied. The activation energies were calculated to be 13.6 and 9.3 KJ/mol for free and bound CHO, respectively. The low activation energy related to the bound CHO suggests that when bound to the magnetic nanoparticles, CHO seems to acquire a better orientation that reduces the energy barrier for activity.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Effect of various temperatures on the activity Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-CHO at pH 7.4.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1477-3155-3-1-7"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Arrhennius plots of the initial plots of the oxidation rates of cholesterol by free CHO (&#x025a0;) and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-CHO (&#x025c6;) for samples at 50, 60, or 70&#x000b0;C.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1477-3155-3-1-8"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Storage stabilities</title><p>The stability and activity of the enzyme are naturally reduced during storage.

However, the residual activity of bound CHO was 59% during the same time period, and 27% after 30 days indicating a considerable enhancement on its stability. It has been argued that this higher stability of the bound enzyme was due to its fixation on the surface of magnetic nanoparticles, preventing the auto-digestion and thermal inactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Another plausible explanation is that the binding of CHO on Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>nanoparticles might allow a better spatial orientation of the FAD prosphetic groups and the side chains of CHO providing a better stability to the enzyme.</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p>Storage stability of free CHO (&#x025a0;) and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-CHO (&#x025c6;).

The samples for TEM analysis were prepared by placing a drop of the magnetic nanoparticles dispersed in nanopure water onto a copper grid and evaporated in air at room temperature. Before preparing a sample onto the copper grid, the dispersed solution was sonicated for 4 min to obtain better particle dispersion. The binding of CHO onto the magnetic nanoparticles was investigated using FTIR. CHO and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-CHO samples in phosphate buffer and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>particles were dissolved in nanopure water for FTIR analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Activity measurement</title><p>The activity of bound CHO was determined by measuring the initial oxidation rates of cholesterol by cholesterol oxidase at given temperature following the increase of 4-cholesten-3-one concentration at 240 nm, using a Beckman Du Spectrometer. A solution of cholesterol was prepared by dissolving 4.8 g of cholesterol in 10 mL of 2-propanol. A phosphate buffer solution (0.05 M. pH 7.4) containing 4% of Triton-100 was added to the mixture to result in a 0.26 M cholesterol solution. The mixture was gently heated until the solution was clear. To start the enzymatic reaction, 5 ml of cholesterol solution was added to 15 mL centrifuge test tubes containing Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-CHO, and mixed by vortex. A solution of free CHO of the same concentration was used to evaluate the activity of the free enzyme. The solution was incubated at various temperatures (25&#x02013;70&#x000b0;C) at specific intervals of time (1 h) and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min to separate the supernatant from Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-CHO. 10 &#x003bc;L aliquots of the supernatant were then taken and the concentration of 4-cholesten-3-one was assessed. Before measuring the amount of 4-cholesten-3-one in a sample, the activity of the free enzyme was stopped by adding an equal volume of acetonitrile to the reacting solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Each kinetic measurement was the average of duplicate replications.</p></sec><sec><title>Thermal stability of free and immobilized enzyme</title><p>The thermal stability of free and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-CHO were determined by measuring the residual activity of the enzyme at 25&#x000b0;C, after being exposed to different temperatures (25&#x02013;70&#x000b0;C) in phosphate buffer (0.05 M, pH 7.4) for 40 min. Aliquots of the reacting solution were taken at time intervals (every 30 min for 7 hours) and assayed for enzymatic activity as described above.

A solution of cholesterol was added to the various centrifuge test tubes containing bound or free enzymes. The test tubes were stored in a water bath at specific temperatures (25, 37, 50, 60, and 70&#x000b0;C). At time intervals, the concentration of 4-cholesten-3-one was determined by spectrophotometric analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Storage activity</title><p>The storage stability was evaluated by determining the concentration of 4-cholest-en-3-one at room temperature at time intervals (5 days). Test tubes containing Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-CHO or free enzyme solution were stored at 25&#x000b0;C in phosphate buffer (0.05 M. pH 7.4) for 30 days. Thereafter, 5 mL of cholesterol was added. The storage stability of the free and bound cholesterol oxidase was determined by assaying for their residual activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of kinetics parameters</title><p>The kinetic parameters of free CHO and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-CHO, <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> and <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> were determined by measuring initial rates of oxidation of cholesterol (1.3&#x02013;5.2 mM) by CHO (0.25 mg/mL) in phosphate buffer pH 7.4 at 25&#x000b0;C.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Magnetic nanoparticles were synthesized by thermal co-precipitation of ferric and ferrous chlorides. The binding of CHO to the particles was confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy and the size characterized by TEM. The binding efficiency was between 98 and 100% irrespective of the amount of particles used. Kinetic studies of the free and bound CHO revealed that the stability and activity of CHO were significantly improved upon binding to nanoparticles. Furthermore, the bound enzyme exhibited a better tolerance to pH, temperature and substrate concentration. The activation energy indicated that the binding of CHO onto Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>magnetic nanoparticles reduced the energy barrier for CHO activity. As a result of the binding to the magnetic nanoparticles, the storage stability of CHO was considerably enhanced. This higher stability of the Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-CHO is attributable to its possible fixation on the surface of the particles preventing auto-digestion and thermal inactivity. In addition, the binding on Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>nanoparticles might allow a better spatial orientation of the FAD prosphetic groups and the side chains of CHO to provide better stability to the enzyme. The overall improvements observed in activity, stability, and functionality of CHO resulted from structural and conformational changes of the bound cholesterol oxidase. The study may be useful in improving the stability and activity of cholesterol oxidase, and will contribute to more efficient use of this enzyme.</p></sec><sec><title>List of Abbreviations used</title><p>CHO: Cholesterol oxidase</p><p>TEM: Transmission electron microscopy</p><p>FTIR: Fourier Transform Infrared</p><p>BSA: Bovine serum albumin</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>Drs Gilles K Kouassi and Joseph Irudayaraj were the primary authors.
