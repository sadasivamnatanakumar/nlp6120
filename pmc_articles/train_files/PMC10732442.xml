This paper examines knowledge management practices within two engineering organisations with an emphasis on barriers to its effectiveness and the influence of current and anticipated deployment of digital technologies. Two methods were used to gather research data across both organisations by combining a series of semi-structured interviews with a quantitative social network analysis. Examination of the acquired data provided insights into the relationship between the knowledge management culture in both organisations and their adoption of digital tools. Hudson&#x02019;s evolutionary model of safety culture has been modified to describe the culture of knowledge management in an organisation and the acquired data used to locate the two organisations on their knowledge management journey. It is proposed that social networks could be used as an indicator of the stage of evolution of knowledge management in engineering organisations more generally with low network densities and dispersed networks representing higher stages of evolution.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

Introduction</title><p>When an organisation is a social community specialising in the speed and efficiency of the creation and transfer of knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] then knowledge is the foundation of an organisation&#x02019;s competitive advantage and the primary driver of an organisation&#x02019;s value [<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. More details on concepts of data, information and knowledge, types of knowledge, and knowledge processes can be found in, for example, [<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Many knowledge intensive organisations have invested in tools and policies to foster knowledge sharing and to solve knowledge sharing problems [<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is widely recognised that poor communication and coordination within an established network leads to poor organisational performance [<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and therefore, effective knowledge management is of vital importance within engineering organisations whose functions involve the planning, design, processing and delivery of engineering products or services. Digital technologies are providing an expanding box of tools to support knowledge management; however, there is evidence in the literature that the implementation of these tools is not uniform and rarely holistic [<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Hence, it is relevant to examine the extent to which the adoption of digital technologies is supporting the knowledge management culture of knowledge intensive organisations.</p><p>A network approach is used in knowledge management as they both deal with the concept of interactivity [<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Interactions among people are generated through communication, coordination and collaboration. Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) likened knowledge to a fluid where these interactions can be represented as flows of information and knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The way that knowledge flows in organisations is often a hidden process [<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A social network analysis can be used to map and analyse these invisible knowledge flows.</p><p>Social network analysis (SNA) is a sociological paradigm used to analyse structural patterns in relationships amongst individuals, groups and organisations [<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. It allows researchers to examine naturally existing patterns and relationships between and within groups, which is especially useful for studying human behaviour [<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Some researchers have employed social network analysis to understand knowledge sharing and knowledge creation within organisations [<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, despite promising developments in some fields, SNA is still underused in the engineering field, and there is nearly no published research in which SNA has been applied to analyse engineering knowledge management [<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>This paper examines knowledge management practices within two engineering organisations by addressing the following research questions: 1. How is knowledge being communicated within and across engineering organisations? 2. What are the current challenges to knowledge management? 3. What are the expected improvements in knowledge management as a result of the use of digital technology? Through a two-method approach combining social network analysis and semi-structured interviews, two case studies were conducted in different engineering organisations. Based on the acquired data, this paper assesses the implications of the adoption of digital technologies on current and future engineering knowledge management practices and introduces a model for the evolution of a knowledge management culture based on an established model for health and safety culture in organisations [<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>2. Research methodology</title><sec id="sec003"><title>2.1 Case study design</title><p>Two engineering organisations with differing digital maturity and organisational cultures were chosen for the case studies. Organisation A is a national and international engineering consultancy company. A three-month ethnographic study was conducted in one of their satellite offices, which was delivering infrastructure projects for decommissioning and construction clients in the area. In total, 31 interviews were conducted in Organisation A.</p><p>Organisation B is a company that generates electricity. A series of semi-structured interviews were conducted within a one-month period. In total, 16 interviews were conducted in Organisation B. There were no known interactions between the two organisations.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>2.2 Mixed method social network analysis</title><p>Social network analysis can be used to understand the structural and relational characteristics of knowledge networks [<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Mixed-method social network analysis involves combining SNA methods with other more qualitative approaches [<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A mixed-method approach enables researchers to both map and measure network properties and to explore and explain issues relating to the generation, variability and dynamics of network ties, and the meaning involved in those ties.</p><p>For use in both organisations, a survey was created based on the social network analysis methodology used by Knoke and Yang (2019) in their study [<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. An ego-centric approach was used to generate the social networks. In ego-centric studies, a set of focal nodes called &#x0201c;egos&#x0201d; and their ties to other nodes called &#x0201c;alters&#x0201d; are assessed [<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The &#x0201c;alters&#x0201d; are not necessarily among the set of egos. The selection of the interviewees followed the maximum-variation strategy [<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Interviewees were selected to provide a distribution of official roles, length of experience working in the organisation, and areas of expertise. Before selecting interviewees in each organisation, meetings with senior staff in two organisations were conducted to understand their organisational culture and the role of people in the organisational structure. The set of interviewees were asked to fill in the survey which was sent to them seven days before conducting the interviews. Two questions were asked in the survey about who sought knowledge from the &#x02018;egos&#x02019; and about from whom the &#x02018;egos&#x02019; sought knowledge. The answers to these questions were used to map two types of knowledge transfer network that exist in the organisations, one describing the flow of knowledge towards the &#x02018;egos&#x02019; and the other away from the &#x02018;egos&#x02019;. A third question was asked about with whom the &#x02018;egos&#x02019; interacted when new knowledge was needed and these responses were used to map the knowledge creation network in each organisation describing the knowledge flows associated with generating new knowledge. 25 individuals (81% of those canvassed) in Organisation A returned the surveys, and 12 people (75%) in Organisation B, which was considered an adequate response because a network response rate of 75% is typically required in SNA for data to be considered reliable [<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In order to supplement the data collection, the three survey questions were asked again in the semi-structured interviews to collect data not acquired from the surveys. The collected data was then processed using the Gephi 0.9.7 software (available at <ext-link xlink:href="http://gephi.org" ext-link-type="uri">http://gephi.org</ext-link>) which is an open-source package for social network analysis and visualisation [<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Network diagrams were created using the Force-Atlas-2 Algorithm, which is a spatialisation algorithm for network visualisation proposed by Gephi team [<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These diagrams contained nodes representing individuals and ties representing the knowledge flows between them, see for example <xref rid="pone.0295250.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>2.3 Semi-structured interviews</title><p>Semi-structured interviews were used to explore subjective viewpoints and to gather in-depth descriptions of the experiences of individuals [<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A list of interview questions was developed and used in all of the interviews (see <xref rid="pone.0295250.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Appendix</xref>). During the interviews, additional questions were asked based on the direction taken in the interview or to clarify issues. Before starting, the interviewees were reassured about the confidentiality of the process and given background information about the aim of the interview and a brief explanation of the topic. The interviews lasted approximately 50 minutes on average. Face-to-face interviews were audio recorded, and the virtual interviews were conducted on Microsoft Teams and were video recorded. All the interviews were transcribed and thematic analysis performed using the NVivo Mac 1.6.2 software developed by QSR International (available at <ext-link xlink:href="https://lumivero.com/products/nvivo/" ext-link-type="uri">https://lumivero.com/products/nvivo/</ext-link>). To preserve the anonymity of the interviewees, each interviewee was assigned a number, this number was also used within the social network analysis to represent each node. A thematic analysis approach was subsequently used to analyse the qualitative data collected.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>2.4 Thematic analysis</title><p>A thematic analysis was conducted to analyse the qualitative data collected during the interviews. Thematic analysis is a method for identifying, analysing and reporting patterns within data [<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The data analysis process followed the work by Salda&#x000f1;a (2009) and Corbin and Strauss (1998) and started with open coding in which the qualitative data was broken down into discrete parts that were labelled as &#x02018;codes&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295250.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Codes might be a single word, sentence, paragraph or visualised portion of qualitative data [<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Then an axial coding was employed to identify connections between codes and assembly them into categories (the axes around which the codes orbit). Finally, the categories were linked together into themes via a reflective process which identified a problem, an issue, or an event that appeared to be significant to the interviewees. Themes exist at a more implicit and abstract level that requires a researcher&#x02019;s interpretation, while categories have explicit content in the form of text and descriptions of the interviewees&#x02019; statements. Butler-Kisber described the qualitative inquiry process as consisting of extracting verbatim significant statements from the data, formulating meanings about them through the researcher&#x02019;s interpretations, clustering these formulated meanings into a series of organised themes, and elaborating each theme through rich written descriptions [<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Due to the ethnographic nature of the data, the research methodology was designed to ensure the privacy of participants was protected. A week before each interview, the interviewees were asked to fill in a consent form to confirm their willingness to participate and share information, and to explain the privacy protocols for the data collection, data analysis and storage, and the outputs of the network analysis. All the information contained in the consent form was reconfirmed with the interviewees at the beginning of every interview.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec007"><title>3. Results and discussion</title><sec id="sec008"><title>3.1 Social network analysis results</title><p>Three knowledge networks were mapped for each organisation based on the survey and interview responses from the interviewees. These networks were (i) a &#x02018;knowledge consultation network&#x02019; (&#x0201c;whom would you consult when you encounter a knowledge gap?&#x0201d;), (ii) a &#x02018;knowledge provision network&#x02019; (&#x0201c;who would seek help from you when they encounter a knowledge gap?&#x0201d;), and (iii) a &#x02018;knowledge creation network&#x02019; (&#x0201c;who would you communicate with when creating new knowledge?&#x0201d;).</p><p>These networks for Organisations A and B are shown in Figs <xref rid="pone.0295250.g001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0295250.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295250.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and some initial observations can be made from these diagrams. The networks for Organisation A appear to have two or three &#x02018;main players&#x02019; in the centre with four or five clusters around a single individual. While Organisation B appears to have networks with four or five &#x02018;main players&#x02019; in the centre with only a couple of clusters around single individuals. These differences might arise because Organisation A has some technology-based knowledge management that enables a more dispersed network whereas Organisation B lacks significant knowledge management technology such that the main players are the principal source of knowledge. It is also noteworthy that Organisation A has a small group of people external to the organisation interspersed in its networks whereas Organisation B has large clusters of external people.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0295250.g001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0295250.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Knowledge consultation networks.</title><p>[Whom would you consult when you encounter a knowledge gap?] for Organisation A [an engineering consultancy] (left) and Organisation B [an electricity generator] (right); the diameter of the nodes indicates the out-degree centrality (sum of outbound ties from a node).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0295250.g001" position="float"/></fig><fig position="float" id="pone.0295250.g002"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0295250.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Knowledge provision networks.</title><p>[Who would seek help from you when they encounter a knowledge gap?] in Organisation A [an engineering consultancy] (left) and Organisation B [an electricity generator] (right); the diameter of the nodes indicates the in-degree centrality (sum of inbound ties to a node).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0295250.g002" position="float"/></fig><fig position="float" id="pone.0295250.g003"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0295250.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Knowledge creation networks.</title><p>[Who would you communicate with when creating new knowledge?] in Organisation A [an engineering consultancy] (left) and Organisation B [an electricity generator] (right); the diameter of the nodes indicates the in-degree centrality (sum of inbound ties to a node).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0295250.g003" position="float"/></fig><p>In order to facilitate more detailed interpretation of these networks, five characteristics were then determined to quantitively analyse them, specifically, out-degree centrality, in-degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality and network density. Whilst these quantitative measures facilitate comparisons and identification of trends, it should be noted that their values will contain uncertainties arising from interviewees failing to mention some communication pathways for a variety of reasons, including forgetfulness, and the lack of responses from some individuals. However, these uncertainties are unlikely to influence the comparisons and trends discussed below.</p><p>Out-degree centrality measures the sum of outbound ties from one node to all adjacent nodes. The direction of the tie is the same as the direction of the knowledge flow, which means the tie starts from the knowledge resource node and points to the knowledge recipient node. In the knowledge consultation network, out-degree centrality is calculated based on how many knowledge flows originate from a node.

Hence the information is uni-directional because in the knowledge consultation network, the data reveals who the interviewees consult when they have a knowledge gap but not who the other nodes consult when they have a similar gap. Similarly, for the knowledge provision network, the interviews reveal who sought knowledge from the interviewees but not who sought knowledge from those who were not interviewed. In other words, in the knowledge consultation network, the knowledge resource was identified by the interviewees and the interviewees considered themselves as knowledge recipients. While in the knowledge provision network, the knowledge recipient was identified by the interviewees and the interviewees considered themselves as a knowledge resource.</p><p>In the knowledge creation network, the node diameter is also based on in-degree centrality. In contrast to the previous two networks, the tie direction is not determined by the knowledge flow. Knowledge creation conversations tend to be two-way communications instead of uni-directional consultations or provisions of knowledge. Hence, the interviewees were asked to identify people who were involved in knowledge creation with them and this determined the tie direction; therefore, the tie directions are from interviewees pointing towards others. Again, the node diameter was proportional to the in-degree centrality in the knowledge creation network in <xref rid="pone.0295250.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>, as for the knowledge provision network; hence, the larger nodes have been mentioned more frequently as participants in knowledge creation conversations. <xref rid="pone.0295250.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> lists the seven largest values of in-degree centrality for each organisation in knowledge creation network, i.e., the most frequent participants in knowledge creation with the interviewees.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0295250.t003"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0295250.t003</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>In-degree centrality (sum of inbound ties for a node) in the knowledge creation networks in <xref rid="pone.0295250.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> for the individuals with the highest in-degree centrality, i.e., most frequent participants in knowledge creation conversations with interviewees.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0295250.t003" id="pone.0295250.t003g" position="float"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Organisation A</th><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Organisation B</th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Node No.</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">In-degree centrality</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Node No.</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">In-degree centrality</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">49</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">35</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.7</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap><p>The responses to all three questions described at the start of this section were combined to provide a complete list of people with whom each interviewee interacted and this dataset was used to create the knowledge exchange networks shown in <xref rid="pone.0295250.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>.

It was stated frequently in the interviews that digital platforms had been set up within the organisations either with the purpose or potential to enhance knowledge management; however, they were not used regularly by people which would be expected will eventually lead to the systems being underused and redundant. Various reasons were cited for this, including lack of awareness and ignorance of how to use the systems. Examples of statements include:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>&#x026ac;&#x02003;&#x0201c;There&#x02019;s a lot of platforms are doing similar things, so I think this is where people will start to get confused between SharePoint, Yammer, and Teams.&#x0201d; [A7]</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x026ac;&#x02003;&#x0201c;But I&#x02019;m sure there&#x02019;s fountains of knowledge on the enterprise systems that I just actually don&#x02019;t utilise [them].

The digital platforms that are being used by the organisation were described as user unfriendly due to their outdated functions. This is the most frequently mentioned category in Organisation B. Some examples are:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>&#x026ac;&#x02003;&#x0201c;You do a search, and the document was not there.

Apparently due to the lack of well-adopted knowledge management processes and tools, people stated that they rely on their personal networks to find the knowledge and information they need. This causes certain people to become overwhelmed by calls and emails asking for information which could be found on digital systems. This was particularly prevalent when a new recruit or someone in a new role needed to seek or create knowledge. This is one of the most frequently mentioned categories in Organisation A. Some examples include:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>&#x026ac;&#x02003;&#x0201c;It&#x02019;s more about your informal networks, which is fine if you&#x02019;ve been here awhile and you&#x02019;ve got networks, but actually if you&#x02019;re new, it&#x02019;s more of a challenge.&#x0201d; [A29]</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x026ac;&#x02003;&#x0201c;We run on networks, people&#x02019;s networks.

This involves obtaining tacit knowledge through asking the right questions to the right people and explicit knowledge from digital or paper-based systems easily and efficiently. Interviewees highlighted challenges related to the accessibility of knowledge including issues around searchability and curation of knowledge which were associated with knowledge capture, storage and re-use. Typical comments included:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>&#x026ac;&#x02003;&#x0201c;The system is great, there&#x02019;s so much on it.

These categories are described in the following sub-sections:</p><list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p><italic toggle="yes">Availability of an intelligent search engine</italic>. Interviewees in both organisations mentioned the desirability of having an intelligent search engine for accessing the useful information from the digital systems effectively and for it to be intelligent enough to suggest the appropriate information. For example:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>&#x026ac;&#x02003;&#x0201c;If you look at the algorithms that Google run, it&#x02019;s quite clever how they are able to immediately give you answers.

A way forward might be that in some way we digitise all the reports.

Interviewees mentioned that BIM models have the potential to facilitate shared understanding and support the accessibility of needed information. For example:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>&#x026ac;&#x02003;&#x0201c;Some jobs I&#x02019;ve used BIM for knowledge management in terms of operation and maintenance of a new plan.

The knowledge which supports decision-making is embedded in people&#x02019;s judgments, understanding, conversations, emails, reports and documents. The decision being made can be recorded in documents, for example, in reports or drawings; however, the knowledge behind the decision-making is usually lost in the process. Interviewees mentioned that preserving the knowledge generated during the decision-making process was vital. For example:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>&#x026ac;&#x02003;&#x0201c;If they&#x02019;ve gone, it&#x02019;s quite difficult to get in touch with people. But what you should try to do in the project is recording as much as you can as you&#x02019;re going along.

The importance of lessons learned and learning from experience was mentioned by many interviewees. Yet in the current work, virtually no lessons learned could be accessed for reuse from the digital systems. Interviewees mentioned their expectations of having lessons learned centrally stored and being searchable and reusable with digital support. For example:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>&#x026ac;&#x02003;&#x0201c;If you are at the start of the project, if you put in the keywords, it comes back with learning from experience from other projects.

These are described below:</p><list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p><italic toggle="yes">Availability of an information management system</italic>. A number of interviewees mentioned that an information management system, providing executive information and &#x0201c;know who&#x0201d; knowledge internally and across the supply chain, would be effective in supporting efficient communication and collaboration. An example of their statements is:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>&#x026ac;&#x02003;&#x0201c;The use of Wikipedia type pages, it can be helpful to get information through that.

A communication platform could work as a common space for knowledge sharing and to facilitate discussions and knowledge creation&#x02013;this functionality was seen has a useful facility by a number of interviewees. For example:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>&#x026ac;&#x02003;&#x0201c;When we started off with Covid, I said what we needed was some sort of equivalent of the coffee room, a chat room that it could, one, take your mind off work for a few minutes, giving you a mental break.

Three, the number of times you&#x02019;ve got some really interesting technical discussions going on, you go back to your desk afterwards thinking that I&#x02019;ve got an idea.

This normative view is explored in this section using the data acquired and a model that originates in the health and safety ethos of organisations. The evolutionary model of safety culture, described by Hudson in 2001, has been widely used to characterise the development of the ethos of an organisation [<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The model has five developmental stages from &#x02018;<bold>pathological</bold>&#x02019; (who cares as long as we are not caught) through &#x02018;<bold>reactive</bold>&#x02019; (safety is important, we do a lot every time we have an accident), &#x02018;<bold>calculative</bold>&#x02019; (we have systems in place to manage all hazards) via &#x02018;<bold>proactive</bold>&#x02019; (we work on the problems that we still find) to &#x02018;<bold>generative</bold>&#x02019; (safety is how we do business round here). When an organisation progresses through these stages people becoming more informed about safety matters and there is an increase in trust associated with the processes.</p><p>Two of the co-authors have held responsibility for health and safety in engineering organisations and hence are familiar with both this model and the reality of safety culture. This led to identifying parallels with the evolution of knowledge management which became apparent during this study and hence an evolutionary model of knowledge management has been developed and is shown in <xref rid="pone.0295250.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>. As in the evolutionary model of safety culture, there is an increasing awareness as an organisation evolves its knowledge management culture and this is accompanied by increasing integration of knowledge management in people&#x02019;s work processes as well as additive deployment of technology to support knowledge management. These trends are illustrated by the long arrows pointing diagonally upwards and forming a pair of tramlines in <xref rid="pone.0295250.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>. Exemplars of the format of the current technologies involved in the additive deployment are shown in the white rectangular boxes to the left of each stage in the evolution.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0295250.g006"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0295250.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Evolutionary model of knowledge management (KM).</title><p>Based on the evolutionary model of safety culture [<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]; the intensity of the colour indicates the level of maturity of the knowledge management culture.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0295250.g006" position="float"/></fig><p>There are five stages in the new model, as in the model of safety culture that they emulate closely, and they are &#x02018;<bold>ignored</bold>&#x02019; (we have no knowledge management and no plans for knowledge management), &#x02018;<bold>perfunctory</bold>&#x02019; (we have information management processes regarded as knowledge management), &#x02018;<bold>compliant</bold>&#x02019; (we have knowledge management processes because we believe that we should), &#x02018;<bold>proactive</bold>&#x02019; (knowledge management is valued and continuously improved) and &#x02018;<bold>embedded</bold>&#x02019; (knowledge management is integrated naturally into the daily workflow). In the same way that the evolutionary model of safety culture can act as both a pathway for an organisation wishing to mature its culture and as a diagnostic tool for evaluating the status of the safety culture, the new model can act as a pathway and a diagnostic tool for the state of knowledge management in an organisation.</p><p>It seems likely the Organisation A in this study is somewhere between &#x02018;compliant&#x02019; and &#x02018;proactive&#x02019;, perhaps strategically they are proactive but operationally they are closer to compliant; whereas Organisation B has moved from &#x02018;ignored&#x02019; and might have reached &#x02018;perfunctory&#x02019;. These evaluations are based on the information gained from the semi-structured interviews and therefore are infected with bias; hence, it is interesting to explore whether the level of evolution in knowledge management can be deduced from the social network analysis. The networks for Organisation A tend to have a small number of &#x02018;main players&#x02019; in the centre with a large number of individuals surrounded by a cluster of nodes and relatively low network densities (see <xref rid="pone.0295250.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) whereas Organisation B networks have a large number of &#x02018;main players&#x02019; with only a small number with clusters of nodes around them and high network densities&#x02013;an order of magnitude larger than for Organisation A. This might imply that there are poor or no knowledge management systems in Organisation B with the result that the &#x02018;main players&#x02019; at the centre of the networks are the source of knowledge and it is difficult for individuals to provide and create knowledge independently of them, which is supported by the mean centralities for the highest centrality individuals in the knowledge consultation, provision and creation networks being greater for Organisation B than A (see Tables <xref rid="pone.0295250.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295250.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). While in Organisation A some level of knowledge management system allows a large number of individuals to access to knowledge and to act independently in providing and creating knowledge both within the organisation and with clients, which is perhaps supported by the larger betweenness centrality values in organisation A (see <xref rid="pone.0295250.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). This supports the conclusion that Organisation A has evolved beyond Organisation B and the ignored or perfunctory stages in <xref rid="pone.0295250.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>.</p><p>An inevitable question from the management of both organisations is what can we do to improve knowledge management. The evolutionary model would imply that Organisation A should plan and develop a knowledge eco-system which would involve integrating their existing systems and embedding them in the ways of working, probably through training to raise awareness. The results of the thematic analysis would point to similar recommendations with the addition of the need to focus on the tacit knowledge associated with decision-making and lessons learned. For organisation B, training and increasing awareness are also important; however, their focus should be on implementing effective knowledge management systems, such as an expert system and collaboration platform.</p><p>It is possible to speculate that further evolution of the knowledge management culture from the stage at which Organisation A has reached would lead to a more dispersed network characterised by a large network diameter (7 for Organisation A compared to 4 for Organisation B) and higher average path length (3.77 for Organisation A compared to 2.75 for Organisation B) with many small clusters or communities of knowledge and low network densities (typical less than one in Organisation A and two to three times greater in Organisation B).</p><p>It is recognised that the two case studies do not provide sufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the relationship between the morphology of an organisation&#x02019;s knowledge networks and the stage of development of its knowledge management culture. Nevertheless, some trends are apparent from this work as described above and are likely relevant to many engineering organisations that share similar characteristics to either Organisation A and, or Organisation B. It has been assumed that the adoption of digital technologies is essential to maturing knowledge management and this assumption is supported by evidence in the literature that digital technologies are being deployed in five main roles as repositories, transactive memory systems, communication spaces, boundary objects, and non-human actors [<xref rid="pone.0295250.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Integrating these roles to allow them to be performed simultaneously and seamlessly would deliver the infrastructure for a knowledge management culture with a high level of maturity and would likely provide significant competitive advantage and organisational value to any organisation but will be particularly significant in knowledge intensive sectors, such as engineering.</p><p>Finally, the comprehensive implementation of digital technologies in an organisation would make it worthwhile considering the digital technologies supporting knowledge management as nodes in the social analysis network and to explore their impact on the shape of the networks.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec014"><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>Social network analysis and a series of semi-structured interviews analysed using thematic analysis have been used to investigate the culture associated with knowledge management and the deployment of digital technology to support knowledge management in engineering organisations. One organisation was an engineering consultancy and the other an electricity generator. The results demonstrate that the two engineering organisations had different cultures and levels of engagement with knowledge management which were characterised by different social networks describing knowledge consultation, provision and creation. The engineering consultancy had networks with relatively low network densities and a small number of key nodes surrounded by nodes in turn surrounded by clusters of nodes; whereas the electricity generator had networks with large numbers of key nodes and high network densities. An evolutionary model of knowledge management culture has been proposed based on an existing evolutionary model for safety culture and it is proposed that the engineering consultancy has evolved its knowledge management culture further than the electricity generator as a consequence of its greater deployment of digital technology for knowledge management. It is proposed that social networks could be used as an indicator of the stage of evolution of knowledge management in engineering organisations with low network density and dispersed networks representing higher stages of evolution.</p></sec><sec id="sec015" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0295250.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Semi-structured interview questions.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0295250.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The cooperation and support of Organizations A and B and their employees is gratefully acknowledged.

So, there is the phrase &#x0201c;knowledge is the foundation of&#x02026; competitive advantage and the primary driver of&#x02026; value&#x0201d;. This is a very large claim, even for knowledge intensive organisations. Some contextualisation and moderation of this claim would help e.g. &#x0201c;The management and exploitation of knowledge can contribute significantly to value&#x02026;&#x0201d;</p><p>2. The statement &#x0201c;provided insights into the maturity of the knowledge management culture&#x0201d; somewhat presupposes some kind of model of maturation. This in turn implies that relating the findings to Hudson&#x02019;s safety management culture model was rather more fundamental to the development of the study. (Currently the connection to Hudson reads as a post-analytic intuition). As a reader I felt that Hudson&#x02019;s model should be described sooner, and perhaps mentioned in the Abstract.</p><p>3. There is a claim that a new evolutionary model knowledge management model is proposed. But there are only two sites, and in neither of them does there appear to be data on the evolution or change in knowledge management.</p><p>4. I think the keywords should include one or both of &#x0201c;knowledge intensive organisations&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;engineering organisations&#x0201d;, as the findings are specific to these kinds of organisation.</p><p>General Comments</p><p>5. I think you need to be clearer throughout the piece that this study is related to engineering organisations. Knowledge management is widespread across many sectors, but the specific expectations are very different in different sectors. I am thinking of the knowledge management needs of health care, law firms, investments banks, biotechnology companies, to name a few. All of these need to manage knowledge, but the meaning of &#x0201c;knowledge&#x0201d; differs and so their precise knowledge management needs differ greatly.</p><p>6. It is not incorrect to state that this is a mixed methods study, but the questions asked are very different in the two parts. In the interviews, you are interested in digital methods of knowledge management; in the social network analysis, you are interested in who talks to whom. I think there needs to be more connection between these two methods.</p><p>7. Some of the numbers in the text do not match the numbers in the figures and tables. E.g. table 1, Node 12 has out-degree centrality of 13, but this is 10 in the text. Table 2 has a similar issue &#x02013; is node 12&#x02019;s in-degree centrality 7 or 8?</p><p>8. On page 10 the topic of &#x0201c;knowledge creation&#x0201d; is introduced. It would be helpful to know precisely what the question was here.</p><p>9. I am not sure about the validity of tables 4 and 5. Do you actually know about all the paths in existence? Since some individuals did not respond, it is presumably possible that there are connections between individuals other than those highlighted. This could be clarified.</p><p>10. In lines 254 to 258 you highlight the different patterns of work in the two organisations. But this begs many questions, and points to a need for more contextual information to help the reader. For example, some thick description on &#x0201c;engineering consultancy&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;energy company&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;single technology group&#x0201d; would flesh out the contexts. (That is, using more ethnographic data to interpret the social network data. While I appreciate the need to maintain organisational anonymity, even some general level description of each organisation would help). The point being that different work has implications for knowledge management.</p><p>11. There is an implied normative view on knowledge management which could be made clearer. So there appears to be an underlying assumption that some kinds of knowledge management are better than others (some are more mature, etc). While this does make some kind of sense, it is treated in a very cursory manner. The connection to the data is not at all clear: for one thing, there is very little in the data about development over time (the interviews were, in effect, cross-sectional). The idea of development might indeed follow from the adaptation of Hudson&#x02019;s model, but in that case there needs to be more in-depth justification of why a model for &#x0201c;safety culture&#x0201d; can be (should be?) adapted for &#x0201c;knowledge management culture&#x0201d;. In relation to this, the assertion based on the literature review [ref 13] that &#x0201c;adoption of digital technologies is essential to maturing knowledge management&#x0201d; could perhaps form the starting point for the paper.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;The aim statement of the paper must be clarified to reflect the main outcome of the paper.</p><p>It seems that the new evolutionary model of knowledge management is the actual result of the investigation in this paper.</p><p>Several key concepts applied in the paper need a brief explanation (as many readers might not be familiar with them).

</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Abstract and Keywords</p><p>1. The Abstract overstates the study. So, there is the phrase &#x0201c;knowledge is the foundation of&#x02026; competitive advantage and the primary driver of&#x02026; value&#x0201d;. This is a very large claim, even for knowledge intensive organisations. Some contextualisation and moderation of this claim would help e.g. &#x0201c;The management and exploitation of knowledge can contribute significantly to value&#x02026;&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0d8; --> We have modified the opening statement in line with the reviewer&#x02019;s suggestion.</p><p>2. The statement &#x0201c;provided insights into the maturity of the knowledge management culture&#x0201d; somewhat presupposes some kind of model of maturation. This in turn implies that relating the findings to Hudson&#x02019;s safety management culture model was rather more fundamental to the development of the study. (Currently the connection to Hudson reads as a post-analytic intuition). As a reader I felt that Hudson&#x02019;s model should be described sooner, and perhaps mentioned in the Abstract.</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0d8; --> This sentence has been recast and Hudson&#x02019;s model introduced into the abstract as proposed by the reviewer.</p><p>3. There is a claim that a new evolutionary model knowledge management model is proposed. But there are only two sites, and in neither of them does there appear to be data on the evolution or change in knowledge management.</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0d8; --> The term &#x02018;evolutionary&#x02019; derives from Hudson&#x02019;s model and we stated that we had located the organisations on their journey rather than identifying change. We have amended the text to associate &#x02018;evolutionary&#x02019; with Hudson&#x02019;s model in the abstract.</p><p>4. I think the keywords should include one or both of &#x0201c;knowledge intensive organisations&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;engineering organisations&#x0201d;, as the findings are specific to these kinds of organisation.</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0d8; --> We have amended the keywords using one of the keywords suggested.</p><p>General Comments</p><p>5. I think you need to be clearer throughout the piece that this study is related to engineering organisations. Knowledge management is widespread across many sectors, but the specific expectations are very different in different sectors. I am thinking of the knowledge management needs of health care, law firms, investments banks, biotechnology companies, to name a few. All of these need to manage knowledge, but the meaning of &#x0201c;knowledge&#x0201d; differs and so their precise knowledge management needs differ greatly.</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0d8; --> We acknowledge that the knowledge management needs of organisations in other sectors might be different; however, we have explicited stated in our title, abstract and introduction that our focus is engineering organisations. We have also been specific in the discussion and conclusions and referred repeatedly to engineering organisations. We would prefer to remain silent on the other types of organisations mentioned by the reviewer because we have no evidence to support a statement. We have changed the conclusions to re-iterate that they relate to engineering organisations.</p><p>6. It is not incorrect to state that this is a mixed methods study, but the questions asked are very different in the two parts. In the interviews, you are interested in digital methods of knowledge management; in the social network analysis, you are interested in who talks to whom. I think there needs to be more connection between these two methods.</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0d8; --> Thank you for highlighting our overuse of the term &#x02018;mixed-method&#x02019;. We agree with the reviewer and have restricted its use to the description of the social network analysis only in section 2.2.</p><p>7. Some of the numbers in the text do not match the numbers in the figures and tables. E.g. table 1, Node 12 has out-degree centrality of 13, but this is 10 in the text. Table 2 has a similar issue &#x02013; is node 12&#x02019;s in-degree centrality 7 or 8?</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0d8; --> Thank you for picking up these typographical errors, we have corrected them in the text.</p><p>8. On page 10 the topic of &#x0201c;knowledge creation&#x0201d; is introduced. It would be helpful to know precisely what the question was here.</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0d8; --> This section has been rewritten to be more explicit about all three questions including the one related to knowledge creation.</p><p>9. I am not sure about the validity of tables 4 and 5. Do you actually know about all the paths in existence? Since some individuals did not respond, it is presumably possible that there are connections between individuals other than those highlighted. This could be clarified.</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0d8; --> There are likely to be more paths than have been identified in the networks due to interviewees neglecting to mention some contacts as well as the lack of responses from some individuals. This implies that there are uncertainties associated with all of the data. This has been clarified in a statement appended to third paragraph in section 3.1.</p><p>10. In lines 254 to 258 you highlight the different patterns of work in the two organisations. But this begs many questions, and points to a need for more contextual information to help the reader. For example, some thick description on &#x0201c;engineering consultancy&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;energy company&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;single technology group&#x0201d; would flesh out the contexts. (That is, using more ethnographic data to interpret the social network data. While I appreciate the need to maintain organisational anonymity, even some general level description of each organisation would help). The point being that different work has implications for knowledge management.</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0d8; --> We agree that some more context would be helpful and included it in a first draft that we shared with the two organisations. Unfortunately, both organisations asked us to revise the descriptions of them to the statements in the submitted manuscript. We are unwilling to re-open this negotiation which could take many months to conclude, possibly with no substantive changes to the descriptions.</p><p>11. There is an implied normative view on knowledge management which could be made clearer. So there appears to be an underlying assumption that some kinds of knowledge management are better than others (some are more mature, etc). While this does make some kind of sense, it is treated in a very cursory manner. The connection to the data is not at all clear: for one thing, there is very little in the data about development over time (the interviews were, in effect, cross-sectional). The idea of development might indeed follow from the adaptation of Hudson&#x02019;s model, but in that case there needs to be more in-depth justification of why a model for &#x0201c;safety culture&#x0201d; can be (should be?) adapted for &#x0201c;knowledge management culture&#x0201d;. In relation to this, the assertion based on the literature review [ref 13] that &#x0201c;adoption of digital technologies is essential to maturing knowledge management&#x0201d; could perhaps form the starting point for the paper.</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0d8; --> Thank you for highlighting this shortcoming and suggesting the starting point which we have adopted in an addition to the introduction. We have also discussed it prior to introducing Hudson&#x02019;s model in section 3.3.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>1. The aim statement of the paper must be clarified to reflect the main outcome of the paper. It seems that the new evolutionary model of knowledge management is the actual result of the investigation in this paper.</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0d8; --> Thank you for this suggestion. The model arose out of the consideration of the results and was not the aim of the investigation so it would be disingenuous to report it as an aim. Nevertheless, we appreciate that it is appropriate to introduce it earlier in the paper and have added a statement at the end of the introduction, as well as in the abstract as requested by reviewer #1.</p><p>2. Several key concepts applied in the paper need a brief explanation (as many readers might not be familiar with them). An addition of a Literature Review section would benefit this paper to explain such concepts relevant to this paper, e.g. the concepts of data, information and knowledge, types of knowledge, the knowledge management process/life cycle, difference between information management system and knowledge management system, relevant digital technologies, social networks in organisations, organisational culture and knowledge Management, etc. Some discussions in the paper about these concepts should be better placed in a Literature Review section.</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0d8; --> Thank you for this suggestion. We feel that these insertions would significantly lengthen the paper and distract from its principal narrative. Instead we have cited some references where readers can refresh their understanding of these topics.</p><p>3. The title for section two should be Research Methodology (it is more appropriate).</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0d8; --> We have made this change, as requested.</p><p>4. I think it is important to clarify in the paper, section 2.2, that the survey will help to identify the knowledge transfer networks that currently exists in the organisations under study. These networks are currently hidden because they have not been formally mapped before. But the surveys are not used to &#x0201c;construct&#x0201d; the networks (line 86, line 133). The authors may have constructed a model of the knowledge networks, but not the networks themselves. The knowledge networks already exist in the organisations.</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0d8; --> Yes, we agree. Thank you for spotting our imprecise use of language which we have corrected.</p><p>5. In section 3.2.1 you discuss types of knowledge. But you haven&#x02019;t explained yet the different types of knowledge in knowledge management. In this section, are you talking about knowledge instruments rather than types of knowledge? Are Tacit Knowledge and Explicit Knowledge examples of types of knowledge? You need to clarify these concepts.</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0d8; --> We have not discussed tacit or explicit knowledge because we did not attempt to distinguish these types of knowledge in discussion with our interviewees. However, we acknowledge that our use the term &#x02018;type of knowledge&#x02019; naturally leads to these concepts whereas infact we have identified &#x02018;forms of knowledge communication&#x02019; &#x02013; we prefer this terminology to knowledge instruments. We have amended section 3.2.1 and figure 5 accordingly.</p><p>6. In section 3.3, line 462, page 21, you need a better explanation of the traffic light system, and provide an example. How can you measure (qualitative/quantitative assessment) the level of knowledge management activity.</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0d8; --> We have deleted the reference to the traffic light system and simplified the figure.</p><p>7. Somewhere at the end of the paper, you need to explicitly link your work and results with achieving competitive advantage (evidence).</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0d8; --> We have rewritten the last paragraph of the discussion in order to strengthen this aspect of the work.</p><p>8. Some discussions of your results in section 3.3 could be generalised considering that Organisation A and B may represent typical engineering organisations in specific sectors, and therefore your work is very relevant for organisations with such characteristics. This contribution needs to be strongly highlighted. Separate your discussions on limitations from your discussions on proposals of further study.</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0d8; --> We have strengthened the point about other organizations and also separated the comment about future work, as suggested.</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0295250.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">authors response v2.pdf</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0295250.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="pone.0295250.r003" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0295250.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Konys</surname><given-names>Agnieszka</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2023 Agnieszka Konys</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2023</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Agnieszka Konys</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0295250" id="rel-obj003" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
