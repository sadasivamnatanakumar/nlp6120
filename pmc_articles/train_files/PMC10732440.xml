Despite the serious threat that microsporidia pose to humans and agricultural animals, few drugs are available for the treatment and control of microsporidia. To identify novel inhibitors, we took advantage of the model organism <italic toggle="yes">Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> infected with its natural microsporidian <italic toggle="yes">Nematocida parisii</italic>. We used this system to screen the Pandemic Response Box, a collection of 400 diverse compounds with known antimicrobial activity. After testing these compounds in a 96-well format at high (100 &#x003bc;M) and low (40 &#x003bc;M) concentrations, we identified four inhibitors that restored the ability of <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">elegans</italic> to produce progeny in the presence of <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">parisii</italic>. All four compounds reduced the pathogen load of both <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">parisii</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Pancytospora epiphaga</italic>, a <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">elegans</italic>-infecting microsporidia related to human-infecting species. One of these compounds, a known inhibitor of a viral protease, MMV1006203, inhibited invasion and prevented the firing of spores. A bis-indole derivative, MMV1593539, decreased spore viability. An albendazole analog, MMV1782387, inhibited proliferation of <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">parisii</italic>. We tested albendazole as well as 5 other analogs and observed that MMV1782387 was amongst the strongest inhibitors of <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">parisii</italic> and displayed the least host toxicity. Our study further demonstrates the effectiveness of the <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">elegans-N</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">parisii</italic> system for discovering microsporidia inhibitors and the compounds we identified provide potential scaffolds for anti-microsporidia drug development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Microsporidia are a large group of parasites which infect both humans and agriculturally important animals such as honey bees and shrimp.

Approximately 1700 species of microsporidia have been identified to infect invertebrates, vertebrates, and protists, with at least 17 species known to infect humans [<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition to posing a serious threat to human health, microsporidia are responsible for substantial economic losses in agriculture. Species of farmed penaeid shrimp are susceptible to hepatopancreatic microsporidiosis, which is caused by <italic toggle="yes">Ecytonucleospora hepatopenaei</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">Vairimorpha ceranae</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Vairimorpha apis</italic> are a threat to the global beekeeping industry [<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A lethal pathogen, <italic toggle="yes">Nosema bombycis</italic>, causes heavy losses or even total culture failure in the silkworm industry [<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, some species, such as <italic toggle="yes">Ameson portunus</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Enterospora nucleophila</italic>, have been identified to infect farmed crabs and fish, respectively [<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Among immunocompromised individuals, <italic toggle="yes">Enterocytozoon bieneusi</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Encephalitozoon intestinalis</italic> are the most common microsporidia infections in humans and are associated with diarrhea and systemic illness [<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In underdeveloped countries, up to 51% of HIV-infected individuals with diarrhea have microsporidia infection [<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Infections with zoonotic microsporidia have been discovered in livestock, companion animals, and wildlife, which poses a risk to public health [<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In recent decades, the NIAID and CDC have recognized that many of these species of microsporidia pose a threat to human health. Thus, microsporidia have been classified as Category B priority pathogens for biodefense research [<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>There are few effective therapeutic interventions available to treat microsporidia infections [<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Albendazole is known to inhibit microtubule polymerization by binding beta-tubulin and is effective against a variety of parasites with little adverse effects in humans [<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In infections of <italic toggle="yes">Encephalitozoon</italic> spp., albendazole has been demonstrated to control microsporidiosis [<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, several studies have shown that albendazole has a limited effect on microsporidiosis caused by <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">bieneusi</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Vittaforma cornea</italic> and that these species encode beta-tubulin with substitutions associated with resistance [<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Analogs of albendazole, benomyl, and carbendazim have been used to control microsporidia in insects such as <italic toggle="yes">Nosema heliothidis</italic> in <italic toggle="yes">Heliothis zea</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Nosema kingi</italic> in <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila willistoni</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, microsporidiosis in mammals cannot be treated with benomyl and carbendazim because of their hepatotoxicity and toxic effects on reproduction [<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Since benzimidazoles have been widely used for decades, resistance fears have arisen. Fumagillin binds specifically and covalently to methionine aminopeptidase type 2 (MetAP2) and can inhibit many species of microsporidia [<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, due to concerns with host toxicity, this drug is not approved for use in humans [<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Furthermore, fumagillin has been associated with concerns regarding its toxicity in agriculture applications [<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Therefore, there is a need to identify additional microsporidia inhibiting agents.</p><p>The model organism <italic toggle="yes">Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> has become a useful system in which to study microsporidia infections and to identify inhibitors. The first microsporidia reported to infect <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">elegans</italic> was <italic toggle="yes">Nematocida parisii</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Infection of <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">elegans</italic> by <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">parisii</italic> begins when spores are ingested into the worm&#x02019;s intestinal lumen, where they expel their unique invasion apparatus called the polar tube [<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This causes the sporoplasm to be deposited inside intestinal cells. The parasite then proliferates intracellularly as meronts and then differentiates into spores, which then exit into the intestinal lumen. Infection of <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">elegans</italic> with <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">parisii</italic> results in smaller body size, reduced reproductive fitness, and shortened life span [<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This host-parasite system has become a model in which to study mechanisms of microsporidia invasion, proliferation, and spore exit [<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0011806.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].

<bold>Key Review Criteria Required for Acceptance?</bold>
</p><p>As you describe the new analyses required for acceptance, please consider the following:</p><p>
<bold>Methods</bold>
</p><p>-Are the objectives of the study clearly articulated with a clear testable hypothesis stated?</p><p>-Is the study design appropriate to address the stated objectives?</p><p>-Is the population clearly described and appropriate for the hypothesis being tested?</p><p>-Is the sample size sufficient to ensure adequate power to address the hypothesis being tested?</p><p>-Were correct statistical analysis used to support conclusions?</p><p>-Are there concerns about ethical or regulatory requirements being met?</p><p>Reviewer #1: (No Response)</p><p>Reviewer #2: This is a very nice study that demonstrates the utility of the C. elegans N. parisii system for moderate throughput screening of a drug library for compounds with activity against microsporidia. The methods are well documented and the statistical analysis is sound with sufficient sample size for determination of active compounds</p><p>--------------------</p><p>
<bold>Results</bold>
</p><p>-Does the analysis presented match the analysis plan?</p><p>-Are the results clearly and completely presented?</p><p>-Are the figures (Tables, Images) of sufficient quality for clarity?</p><p>Reviewer #1: (No Response)</p><p>Reviewer #2: The analysis of the data is well presented and the figures clearly provide the data set needed for interpretation of the experiments. The authors found a benznidazole compound related to albendazole as one active drug. This makes sense as the literature supports albendazole (a benznidazole tubulin binder) as a proven therapeutic agent for several microsporidia. The other class of compounds with activity were flavones, for which the mechanism(s) by which germination is inhibited is not known.</p><p>--------------------</p><p>
<bold>Conclusions</bold>
</p><p>-Are the conclusions supported by the data presented?</p><p>-Are the limitations of analysis clearly described?</p><p>-Do the authors discuss how these data can be helpful to advance our understanding of the topic under study?</p><p>-Is public health relevance addressed?</p><p>Reviewer #1: (No Response)</p><p>Reviewer #2: The conclusions are supported by the data and the discussion is appropriate for the data presented. There is a need for new therapeutic agents for these pathogens so the paper does address an active public health issue.</p><p>--------------------</p><p>
<bold>Editorial and Data Presentation Modifications?</bold>
</p><p>Use this section for editorial suggestions as well as relatively minor modifications of existing data that would enhance clarity. If the only modifications needed are minor and/or editorial, you may wish to recommend &#x0201c;Minor Revision&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;Accept&#x0201d;. </p><p>Reviewer #1: (No Response)</p><p>Reviewer #2: I would suggest at line 82 when Pancytospora is introduced the authors should indicate it is related to Enterocytozoon and Vittaforma rather than just staying "it is related to human-infecting species"</p><p>--------------------</p><p>
<bold>Summary and General Comments</bold>
</p><p>Use this section to provide overall comments, discuss strengths/weaknesses of the study, novelty, significance, general execution and scholarship. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. If requesting major revision, please articulate the new experiments that are needed.</p><p>Reviewer #1: Introduction:</p><p>Microsporidia are obligate intracellular parasites that cause disease in many commercially important invertebrates as well as humans in some limited settings. However, few treatment options exist for controlling microsporidia infections in any organism. The authors search for potential microsporidia therapeutic agents using a screen they previously designed and implemented in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The screen measures the beneficial effects of compounds on the fecundity of microsporidia-infected worms. While this design may result in missing agents that kill microsporidia but are toxic to worms, it also removes compounds that may be unsuitable for use due to detrimental effects on the host. Another advantage of the screen is that it has the potential to find compounds that work by reducing pathogen loads by acting at various stages of the lifecycle and those that work by increasing tolerance to infection. Previously the authors tested 2560 FDA-approved compounds and natural products, and identify 11 candidate microsporidia inhibitors (Murareanu et al., 2022). In the submitted manuscript, the authors test a smaller set of novel compounds (400) from a collection called the Pandemic Response Box, and initially identify 4 novel inhibitors before finding additional promising candidates by exploring compounds that are chemically related to the original &#x02018;hit&#x02019; compounds. The diminished novelty and scope of the screen reduces the impact of this manuscript relative to the previous report. However, this is important work that few groups are engaged in and the manuscript details some very interesting findings. As such, I would only ask that they add a few discussion points to their manuscript. First, the authors state that MMV1782387 works by decreasing proliferation (occurring in the meront through sporoblast stages). It appears that they also find that this compound reduces sporoplasm number (without an impact on firing) (Figure 4 and comments in discussion). They cleverly remove this effect from consideration in the anti-proliferation assay by only adding drug after invasion, but I think this point and their work-around are worth emphasizing. Two other compounds (MMV1593539 and MMV1634491) appear to reduce sporoplasm number (without any impact on proliferation or spore firing). As 3 compounds (MMV1593539, MMV1634491, MMV1782387) seem to have an impact on sporoplasm number / invasion (but not spore firing), could the authors comment on a potential mechanism for this 'invasion' level effect? Second, I was struck by the differential anti-microsporidia and host toxicity effects of the various benzimidazole compounds. Could the authors discuss the likely avenue of host toxicity with these compounds? Is it host beta tubulin? And if so what&#x02019;s known about the structure / function of these compounds and both parasite and host beta tubulin that might explain the different sensitivities of host and pathogen? Finally, I was curious to know what the authors see as the future steps for advancing these and previously identified compounds into a more applied / translational space?</p><p>A small point is that the statements about the beta-tubulin amino acids that potentially mediate sensitivity or resistance to albendazole (line 214-218) should be moved to the discussion.</p><p>References</p><p>Murareanu, B. M., Antao, N. V., Zhao, W., Dubuffet, A., Alaoui, H. E., Knox, J., Ekiert, D. C., Bhabha, G., Roy, P. J. and Reinke, A. W. (2022). High-throughput small molecule screen identifies inhibitors of microsporidia invasion and proliferation in C. elegans. Nat. Commun. 13, 5653.</p><p>Reviewer #2: Overall, this is an excellent paper with a useful moderate throughput screening system. While screening compounds is not novel, this is important work and the compounds identified have the potential to move forward as therapeutic leads. In particular, no significant work has been done on flavones as a therapeutic class for these pathogens and this is a novel area of research suggested by this paper.</p><p>--------------------</p><p>PLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (<ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history" ext-link-type="uri">what does this mean?</ext-link>).
