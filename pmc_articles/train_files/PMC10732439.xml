Post merozoite invasion of a host red blood cell, the ring stage lasts approximately 20 hours and was traditionally thought to be metabolically quiescent. However, recent studies have shown that the ring stage is active in several energy-costly processes, including gene transcription, protein translation, protein export, and movement inside the host cell. It has remained unclear whether a low glycolytic flux alone can meet the energy demand of the ring stage over a long period post invasion. Here, we demonstrate that the metabolic by-product pyrophosphate (PPi) is a critical energy source for the development of the ring stage and its transition to the trophozoite stage. During early phases of the asexual development, the parasite utilizes <italic toggle="yes">Plasmodium falciparum</italic> vacuolar pyrophosphatase 1 (PfVP1), an ancient pyrophosphate-driven proton pump, to export protons across the parasite plasma membrane. Conditional deletion of PfVP1 leads to a delayed ring stage that lasts nearly 48 hours and a complete blockage of the ring-to-trophozoite transition before the onset of parasite death. This developmental arrest can be partially rescued by an orthologous vacuolar pyrophosphatase from <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, but not by the soluble pyrophosphatase from <italic toggle="yes">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, which lacks proton pumping activities. Since proton-pumping pyrophosphatases have been evolutionarily lost in human hosts, the essentiality of PfVP1 suggests its potential as an antimalarial drug target. A drug target of the ring stage is highly desired, as current antimalarials have limited efficacy against this stage.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Membrane-bound proton pumping pyrophosphatases (H<sup>+</sup>-PPases), also known as vacuolar pyrophosphatases (V-PPases), are single-subunit proton pumps powered by hydrolysis of pyrophosphate (PPi) rather than ATP.

Among five <italic toggle="yes">Plasmodium</italic> species that cause human malaria, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">falciparum</italic> is the deadliest. In a human host, the malaria parasite grows exponentially in bloodstream RBCs, causing all clinical symptoms including death in severe cases. The 48 h Intraerythrocytic Development Cycle (IDC) can be divided into three major developmental stages, including the ring, the trophozoite, and the schizont. These stages typically take about ~ 20 h, ~ 18 h, and ~ 10 h, respectively. Within the RBC, the parasite resides in a vacuole and is surrounded by multiple membranes, including the parasite plasma membrane (PPM), the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM), and the red blood cell membrane (RBCM). A major task of the ring stage parasite is to export proteins to the host cell to increase its permeability and cytoadherence [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Over the ~ 20 h period, however, the parasite is not replicating DNA or expanding its biomass significantly. After the RBCM has been permeabilized by the Plasmodium Surface Anion Channel (PSAC) [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], or New Permeability Pathways (NPPs) [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], the trophozoite starts to grow rapidly, resulting in 16&#x02013;32 progeny in the subsequent schizont stage.</p><p>It has been long recognized that the asexual stage parasites rely on glycolysis for ATP production [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Per one molecule of glucose consumed, the parasite makes 2 ATP and 2 lactate molecules, with a minimal percentage of glucose-derived carbons fed into the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Indeed, the parasite can tolerate deletions of many TCA cycle enzymes [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and some components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], implying that the mitochondrion is a negligible source of ATP in the blood stages. To overcome the energy constraint mediated by substrate-level phosphorylation, the trophozoite stage parasite runs a high rate of glycolysis and consumes glucose in a rate that is 100-times faster than normal RBCs [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Permeabilization of the RBCM in this stage also facilitates lactate disposal to avoid a metabolic blockage of glycolysis. With an intact RBCM, however, the ring stage is traditionally thought to be metabolically quiescent, with a low-level of glycolysis being sufficient to meet the energy demand of this parasite [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies, however, suggest that the ring stage parasite fulfills many energy-costly processes over the period post invasion [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Although the genome is not replicating at this stage, RNA transcription and protein translation are active to form a ring stage specific proteome for all necessary activities [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The PTEX translocon catalyzes ATP hydrolysis to move hundreds of parasite proteins to the RBC cytosol and membrane throughout the ring stage [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Rather than being static, ring stage parasites undergo dynamic movement inside the RBC and display morphological changes between the classical ring and a deformable ameboid-like structure [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In addition, the ring stage parasite also needs to spend energy to pump protons across the parasite plasma membrane to maintain the plasma membrane potential (&#x00394;&#x003c8;) and cytosolic pH. It has been suggested that the ATP-consuming V-type ATPase is the major proton pump in trophozoite stage parasites [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, no studies have shown how proton export is carried out in the ring stage. RNA-seq data suggest that subunits of V-type ATPase are not highly transcribed until the trophozoite stage [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref></bold>). Thus, it remains unknown how the ring stage parasite pumps protons and meets its energy demand while running a low-level of glycolysis.</p><p>In this study, we discovered that the ATP independent, proton pumping pyrophosphatase PfVP1 (<underline><italic toggle="yes">P</italic></underline><italic toggle="yes">lasmodium</italic>
<underline><italic toggle="yes">f</italic></underline><italic toggle="yes">alciparum</italic>
<underline>v</underline>acuolar <underline>p</underline>yrophosphatase 1), is the major proton pump during ring stage development. Proton-pumping pyrophosphatases, or H<sup>+</sup>-PPases, catalyze the hydrolysis of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), a by-product of over 200 cellular reactions, while harnessing the energy to pump protons across a biological membrane [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. H<sup>+</sup>-PPase was first discovered in the plant tonoplast and was also named vacuolar pyrophosphatase [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. While H<sup>+</sup>-PPases are absent in fungi and metazoans, it has been evolutionally conserved in bacteria, archaea, plants, and many protozoa [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, two types of H<sup>+</sup>-PPases are present, AVP1 (type I) and AVP2 (type II), and they require different cations for optimal activity. AVP1 is potassium dependent and calcium insensitive whereas AVP2 is calcium dependent and potassium insensitive [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Interestingly, the <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">falciparum</italic> genome also encodes two types of H<sup>+</sup>-PPases, PfVP1 (PF3D7_1456800) and PfVP2 (PF3D7_1235200) [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. RNA-seq data suggest PfVP2 is barely transcribed [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], which is consistent with its non-essential role in the asexual stages [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]; by contrast, PfVP1 is highly transcribed throughout the IDC and exhibits a peak level in the ring stage [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref></bold>). Our data reveal that the malaria parasite <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">falciparum</italic> employs PfVP1 to harness energy from pyrophosphate, an ancient energy source, to support vital biological processes in the ring stage when ATP supply is likely low.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>PfVP1 is mainly localized to the parasite plasma membrane (PPM)</title><p>Localization of the two vacuolar pyrophosphatases in <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">falciparum</italic>, PfVP1 and PfVP2, remains unclear in literature as previous studies used polyclonal antibodies raised against the <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> vacuolar pyrophosphatase 1 (AVP1) in wildtype parasites [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], which were unable to differentiate PfVP1 from PfVP2. We have previously knocked out PfVP2 and did not notice any growth defects in normal culture conditions [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, to study the localization and function of PfVP1 without any potential interference or compensation from PfVP2, we genetically tagged PfVP1 in the PfVP2 knockout (KO) parasite line [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Briefly, in the 3D7-PfVP2 KO line, we utilized the CRISPR/Cas9 system [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] to endogenously tag PfVP1 with either a triple hemagglutinin (3HA) tag or a monomeric fluorescent protein (mNeonGreen). Additionally, through gene editing of the endogenous copy, the tagged PfVP1 was placed under the control of the TetR-DOZI-aptamer system for conditional expression [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref></bold>). Thus, two transgenic parasite lines were constructed, 3D7-PfVP2KO-PfVP1-3HA<sup>apt</sup> and 3D7-PfVP2KO-PfVP1-mNeonGreen<sup>apt</sup>. We also cloned 3D7-PfVP2KO-PfVP1-3HA<sup>apt</sup> by limited dilution and obtained two pure parasite clones, B11 and G11, which were phenotypically indistinguishable (B11 was used for this study). The parasite lines were normally cultured in the presence of 250 nM anhydrotetracycline (aTc) to maintain PfVP1 expression.</p><p>The subcellular localization of PfVP1 was verified by three methodologies, including immunofluorescence assay (IFA), immuno-electron microscopy (immuno-EM), and live cell microscopy (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref></bold>). In the 3D7-PfVP2KO-PfVP1-3HA<sup>apt</sup> line, we performed colocalization studies using antibodies against HA and PfEXP2 [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. PfEXP2 is a marker for the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM) [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], which served as an indicator of the parasite periphery. In the trophozoite stage, IFA revealed that PfVP1 was closely related to the PVM as it appeared to be co-localized with PfEXP2 (Pearson Correlation Coefficient 0.9496&#x000b1;0.034 from 25 parasites). In the ring and schizont stages, however, PfVP1&#x02019;s localization was distinct from that of PfEXP2 (Pearson Correlation Coefficient 0.5670&#x000b1;0.1401 for 25 rings and 0.7508&#x000b1;0.197 for 25 schizonts) (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref></bold>). Especially in the late schizont stage, the PPM invaginations were positive for PfVP1, not for PfEXP2, indicating PfVP1&#x02019;s localization on the PPM. To further verify this in a higher resolution, we performed immuno-EM studies and the data showed that PfVP1 was mainly localized to the PPM, not the PVM (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref></bold>). Quantification of 65 random images revealed 90% of the gold particles were localized to the PPM, ~ 2% of the gold particles were localized to nucleus/ER, and ~ 8% of the gold particles were localized to the cytosol or cytosolic small membranous structures with unknown identities (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref></bold>). Interestingly, no gold particles were apparently localized on the food vacuole, an organelle known to be acidified by proton pumps. To further verify this, we performed co-localization studies of PfVP1 and the food vacuole using the food vacuole marker, PfPlasmepsin II [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We were unable to find any parasites in which PfVP1 and PfPlasmepsin II were colocalized (Pearson Correlation Coefficient 0.6303&#x000b1;0.038 from 25 parasites) (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref></bold>). Thus, PfVP1 did not coincide with the food vacuole, in agreement with the previous publication [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Finally, we used live cell microscopy to verify PfVP1&#x02019;s localization in the 3D7-PfVP2KO-PfVP1-mNeonGreen<sup>apt</sup> line. In every stage of the IDC, including the merozoite, the ring, the trophozoite and the schizont, we detected strong fluorescence of PfVP1-mNeonGreen at the parasite periphery (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C and 1D</xref></bold>). Since merozoites are free of PVM, the peripheral distribution of PfVP1 is consistent with its localization on the PPM, not the PVM. Together, we utilized multiple methods to show that PfVP1 is primarily localized on the parasite plasma membrane.</p><fig position="float" id="ppat.1011818.g001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1011818.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>PfVP1 is mainly localized to the parasite plasma membrane.</title><p><bold>A</bold>, Immunofluorescence assay of 3D7-PfVP2KO-VP1-3HA<sup>apt</sup>.

We detected strong signals of PfVP1 in the transgenic parasite lysate, which were absent in the control lysate. Despite being specific, the band pattern of PfVP1 was highly unusual, ranging from the monomeric form of approximately 79 kDa to large, aggregated forms with molecular weights close to 260 kDa. This smearing band pattern of PfVP1 indicated that PfVP1 proteins were not completely solubilized by 2% SDS treatment. While the exact reasons for this phenomenon remain unclear at present, we speculate two possible explanations. One possibility is that the extremely hydrophobic nature of PfVP1, which possesses 16 transmembrane helices, may lead to solubility issues even in the presence of SDS. The other possibility is that PfVP1 works as oligomers in the parasites. Structural studies have shown that the orthologous VP1 protein in mung beans forms a homodimer to hydrolyze the substrate and pump protons [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

The expression of PfVP1 and AVP1 in yeast was verified by fluorescence microscopy, which showed that the GFP signal appeared mainly on the yeast vacuoles (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref></bold>). Following the established protocols [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], we isolated yeast vesicles from three transformed lines expressing PfVP1, AVP1, or the blank control (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref></bold>). In the isolated yeast vesicles, a 9-Amino-6-Chloro-2-Methoxyacridine (ACMA) fluorescence quenching assay was used to assess the ability of VP1 to pump protons into the vesicle lumen (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref></bold>). The compound&#x02019;s fluorescence is quenched when a pH gradient forms across the vesicle membrane. The conditions of our proton pumping assays were set according to many published papers that studied VP1 proteins of protozoa and plant cells [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] (Materials and Methods). The yeast V-type ATPase, also present on the vesicles, was inhibited by Bafilomycin A1 to block its proton pumping activity. Over time, the PfVP1 possessing vesicles were able to reduce ACMA fluorescence (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>, red</bold>). The positive control AVP1 expressing vesicles also quenched ACMA (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>, green</bold>), as expected, whereas the negative control vesicles bearing no H<sup>+</sup>-PPase exhibited little effect (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>, cyan</bold>). When Nigericin was added (a proton ionophore that abolishes transmembrane proton gradients), the quenched ACMA fluorescence was restored to its original levels (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref></bold>). This verified that the yeast vesicles were intact and PfVP1 and AVP1 expressing vesicles had accumulated protons inside. We also assessed PfVP1&#x02019;s enzymatic activity by measuring free Pi released by PPi hydrolysis (Materials and Methods). In comparison to the negative control vesicles (set to zero), PfVP1 expressing vesicles produced a net of 1.24 &#x003bc;moles free Pi per mg of protein per h, similar to that produced by the AVP1 vesicles (1.14 &#x003bc;moles/mg/h) (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref></bold>).

Again, PfVP1 knockdown caused delayed ring stage development and a complete blockage of the ring to trophozoite transition. At the end of the 2<sup>nd</sup> IDC, we noticed that some knockdown parasites had expanded the cytosol slightly in comparison to parasites of earlier time-points and small hemozoin particles were also visible (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref></bold>), suggesting that the arrested parasites conducted some biochemical activities such as partial hemoglobin digestion. These results prompted us to verify whether the arrested parasites had established the New Permeability Pathway (NPP) [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This pathway is a result of the parasite&#x02019;s ability to insert a channel known as the Plasmodium surface anion channel (PSAC) to the RBC membrane [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The establishment of PSAC leads to the infected RBC releasing hemoglobin and undergoing osmotic lysis in response to high concentrations of small solutes. To investigate this, we treated the knockdown parasites at 72 h and 96 h post aTc removal with 500 mM alanine/10 mM HEPES and quantified the hemoglobin content in the supernatants. As shown in <bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7C Fig</xref></bold>, at 96 h post knockdown, the aTc (-) culture exhibited a lower degree of osmotic lysis than that of the control. This observation suggests that the NPP was partially established in the knockdown parasites at 96 h after aTc removal. Despite this, however, none of the knockdown parasites showed the morphology of a normal looking trophozoite at this time. On the other hand, when the knockdown experiment was initiated from the ring stage, parasites also did not exhibit obvious defects in the 1<sup>st</sup> IDC (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7D Fig</xref>)</bold>.

We reasoned if PfVP1 was genuinely a PPi-dependent proton pump located on the PPM, changes to cytosolic pH and PPi levels would be expected in the knockdown parasites. We used the ratiometric pH sensitive dye, 2&#x02019;,7&#x02019;-Bis-(2-Carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-Carboxyfluorescein, Acetoxymethyl Ester (BCECF-AM), to measure cytosolic pH following the established protocol [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. BCECF-AM is membrane permeable and is trapped inside the parasite cytosol after its ester group is removed. We initially aimed to measure cytosolic pH at 48, 72 and 96 h after aTc removal from schizonts. However, attempts to measure pH in ring stage parasites were unsuccessful. The failure was likely due to the small size or inadequate number of ring stage parasites per measurement. Nevertheless, our experience agrees with the fact that BCECF-AM has only been reported to measure cytosolic pH in trophozoite stage parasites [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], not in the ring stage.</p><p>At 48 h post aTc removal, we detected a small yet significant decrease of cytosolic pH in the knockdown parasites at the trophozoite stage (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref></bold>). This degree of pH drop from 7.41&#x000b1;0.05 to 7.17&#x000b1;0.11, however, did not negatively affect parasite growth and development as the knockdown parasites at 48 h post aTc removal exhibited no discernible abnormal morphologies (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref></bold>). To further test if such a small cytosolic pH change was specific to knockdown of PfVP1, we added aTc back to the knockdown culture on day 2 post aTc removal then measured pH again on day 4. After aTc addback for 2 days, the cytosolic pH of trophozoite stage parasites was restored to a normal level (7.35&#x000b1;0.07) (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref></bold>). This result suggested that the small, yet significant decrease of cytosolic pH was specific to PfVP1 knockdown.

In some organisms, however, the two functions are not equally important. For example, in <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">thaliana</italic>, the proton pumping activity of AVP1 is not essential, whereas the PPi hydrolysis activity is absolutely required. A previous study showed that a loss-of-function of AVP1 was rescued by expression the <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">cerevisiae</italic> inorganic pyrophosphatase (yIPP1) [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The yIPP1 protein has the sole function of PPi removal, with no energy saving or proton pumping activity. Therefore, in plant VP1 proteins, the proton pumping activity is less important than the PPi hydrolysis activity. To test if this scenario was also true for PfVP1, we performed a second round of transfection to complement the knockdown parasites with an episomal copy of yIPP1 (single function), AVP1 (dual function) or PfVP1 (dual function, control). The genes were cloned in plasmids containing hDHFR (human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase) [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] as the selectable marker. Since hDHFR was already used to knock out PfVP2 in the 3D7-PfVP2KO-PfVP1-3HA<sup>apt</sup> line, we made a new knockdown line in D10 wildtype, resulting in a D10-PfVP1-3HA<sup>apt</sup> line. This new PfVP1 knockdown line displayed the same phenotype as the 3D7 counterpart. We then transfected it with plasmids bearing 3Myc-tagged yIPP1, AVP1 or PfVP1 and obtained three individual transgenic lines (Materials and Methods).</p><p>Western blots showed that all Myc tagged copies were expressed independent of aTc, while the endogenous HA tagged PfVP1 was knocked down when aTc was removed for 96 h (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A and 5B</xref></bold>).

In <bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9A Fig</xref></bold>, we once again observed the diffused band pattern of PfVP1 tagged with 3Myc in Western blot, which was consistent with the band pattern of PfVP1-3HA shown in <bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref></bold>. As mentioned earlier, we speculated that PfVP1 proteins were not well solubilized by 2% SDS, which resulted in this highly unusual band pattern. Notably, when a smaller amount of protein was loaded (3 &#x003bc;g in <bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9D&#x02013;S9E Fig</xref></bold> compared to 15 &#x003bc;g in <bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>)</bold>, we could only detect the PfVP1 bands with larger molecular weights, but not the forms at monomeric sizes. This implied that the larger forms of PfVP1 predominated. Despite this unusual band pattern, C-terminal tagging of PfVP1 did not interfere with parasite physiology. This finding is consistent with other VP1 orthologs in Kinetoplastids [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and <italic toggle="yes">Toxoplasma gondii</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], which also utilized C-terminal tagging. We next performed IFA to show that the complemented copies of PfVP1 and AVP1 were localized to the PPM whereas yIPP1 was in the cytosol (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref></bold>). When aTc was removed from synchronized D10-PfVP1-3HA<sup>apt</sup> schizonts for 96 h, the knockdown parasites were arrested in the late ring stage (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref></bold>), which is consistent with the knockdown phenotype of the 3D7 derived counterpart. In contrast, the knockdown parasites complemented with PfVP1-3Myc displayed normal growth like the aTc plus culture, indicating that the episomal PfVP1 fully rescued the loss of the endogenous VP1 protein (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref></bold>). AVP1 complementation displayed a moderate rescue with ~ two thirds of the parasites reaching the same morphology as control parasites (late trophozoites), and ~ one third progressing to a smaller size (early trophozoites). In contrast, yIPP1 was unable to restore parasite growth when the endogenous PfVP1 was knocked down. A quantification of various parasite morphologies in all conditions is shown in <bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref></bold>. To further verify if yIPP1 and AVP1 were enzymatically active in <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">falciparum</italic>, we measured PPi levels in the aTc plus and minus cultures at 96 h post knockdown. As expected, knockdown of PfVP1 led to an elevated level of PPi in the parasites which was diminished in the lines complemented with PfVP1, yIPP1, or AVP1 (<bold><xref rid="ppat.1011818.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F</xref></bold>). Altogether, these data indicate 1) both PfVP1&#x02019;s PPi hydrolysis and proton pumping activities are essential for parasite survival, and 2) although not a 100% functional replacement, the orthologous plant VP1 is able to complement VP1-deficient <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">falciparum</italic>, suggesting the functional conservation between PfVP1 and AVP1.</p><fig position="float" id="ppat.1011818.g005"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1011818.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>The dual functionality of PfVP1 is required for parasite survival.</title><p><bold>A</bold>, Western blot analysis of protein lysates from the D10-PfVP1-3HA<sup>apt</sup> line that was episomally transfected with Myc tagged PfVP1 (wildtype), yIPP1 (yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase), or AVP1 (<italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">thaliana</italic> vacuolar pyrophosphatase 1).

As a control, the episomal wildtype PfVP1 fully rescued the knockdown parasites grown in aTc minus medium. PfVP1 alleles with D236A and D247A mutations were unable to rescue the loss of endogenous VP1, indicating that these mutations abolished PfVP1&#x02019;s functionality. The D461A mutation had a low rescuing ability, but most D461A expressing parasites were unable to progress to the trophozoite stage. These results largely agreed with the results obtained with equivalent mutagenesis studies carried out in VrVP1 [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].

PfVP1 is highly expressed and mainly localized to the parasite plasma membrane. Upon loss of PfVP1, the parasite undergoes a delayed ring stage development and a complete failure of transitioning to the trophozoite stage. To our best knowledge, this is the first report showing that PPi is an energy source for <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">falciparum</italic> to fulfill a critical biological function, at least in one part of the lifecycle.</p><p>While the IDCs of different malaria parasites vary between 24&#x02013;72 h, the ring stage is invariably the longest period. In <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">falciparum</italic>, the duration of the ring stage (~ 20 h) combined with the transition stage from the ring to trophozoite (~2&#x02013;4 h) is about half of the entire IDC [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Inside the RBC, the ring stage parasite moves, changes its shape [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and is actively exporting hundreds of proteins to the host cell [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Moreover, the ring stage is less susceptible to many antimalarial drugs and is the only stage that displays artemisinin resistance [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. During the transition stage from the ring to trophozoite, the parasite also exhibits pronounced changes, including a reduction in the parasite diameter, formation of several small hemozoin foci, and a transient echinocytosis of the host cell (RBC membrane distortion) [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Despite the significance of these early phases of parasite development, little is known about their cellular bioenergetics.</p><p>Earlier studies have shown that the ring stage parasite performs glycolysis at a much lower rate compared to that of the trophozoite stage [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Traditionally, a low-level of glycolysis is thought to be sufficient to support ring stage development. However, our study has revealed that the metabolic by-product PPi serves as a critical energy source during the early phases of the IDC. The free energy of PPi hydrolysis under physiological conditions is estimated to be -22.18 kJ/mol, which is a significant portion of the energy released from ATP hydrolysis (-37.6 kJ/mol) [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Evolutionarily, early life forms on earth used PPi as the energy source before ATP emerged [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Apparently, the early divergent malaria parasite has evolutionarily reserved the ability to use PPi as a critical energy source, especially at the time when the ATP level is low. In the asexual blood stages, the malaria parasite primarily depends on glycolysis for ATP supply as the parasite&#x02019;s mitochondrion performs little or no oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore, PPi becomes a significant energy supplement in the ring stage parasite where glycolysis runs at a lower rate. Future studies will focus on quantifications of ATP and PPi throughout the IDC to understand their energetic contributions to <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">falciparum</italic>.</p><p>What is the likely source of PPi in this metabolically less active ring stage parasite? PPi is a by-product of many synthetic reactions that use ATP (or other nucleoside triphosphate) to generate AMP (or other nucleoside monophosphate) and PPi, such as DNA, RNA, or protein synthesis. In the ring stage, PPi could be derived from a low level of RNA or protein synthesis since the parasite is not replicating DNA. Alternatively, PPi could be derived from some storage organelles such as acidocalcisomes, which store cations (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, etc.) and polyphosphates [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. It has been shown that <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">falciparum</italic> merozoites contain acidocalcisomes [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The presence of acidocalcisomes could indicate that <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">falciparum</italic> likely stores energy as polyphosphates in acidocalcisomes and liberates PPi from polyphosphates as needed when the ATP level is low. These intriguing aspects of acidocalcisome biology in <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">falciparum</italic> deserve further investigations.</p><p>Unlike many other eukaryotes, malaria parasites generate the plasma membrane potential (&#x00394;&#x003c8;) through the transport of protons rather than sodium ions [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The proton gradient across the plasma membrane is also used by the parasite to perform secondary active transport to move ions, nutrients, or waste products into or out of the cell [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. It has been long recognized that the <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">falciparum</italic> possesses two different types of proton pumps, the single subunit PPi-dependent H<sup>+</sup>-PPases [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and the much faster ATP-dependent multi-subunit V-type ATPase [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Inhibition of the V-type ATPase by Bafilomycin A1 for 10&#x02013;12 min causes a rapid drop of cytosolic pH from ~ 7.3 to ~ 6.8 in trophozoite stage parasites [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, the much slower proton pumps, PfVP1 and PfVP2, were thought to be insignificant or &#x0201c;marginal&#x0201d; to the parasite [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Alternatively, other studies have hypothesized that PfVP1 and/or PfVP2 would be critical to trophozoite stage parasites when energy demand is high [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In contrast to those earlier views, our results have now recognized the significance of PfVP1 for ring stage development and the transition to a trophozoite (PfVP2 is dispensable for asexual development [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]). We speculate that PfVP1&#x02019;s contribution to the early phases of development could be multifactorial, fulfilling tasks such as maintaining cytosolic pH, establishing plasma membrane potential (&#x00394;&#x003c8;), and redirecting ATP towards other energy-costly processes. Future studies are required to test these hypotheses. We acknowledge the challenges posed by working with ring stage parasites. For instance, the gold standard method of measuring &#x00394;&#x003c8; using patch clamp electrophysiology has limited applicability to intracellular organisms like <italic toggle="yes">Plasmodium</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The small size of ring stage parasites further diminishes the feasibility of employing this technique. Clearly, alternative methodologies must be explored to thoroughly characterize ring stage biology in future.</p><p>It is interesting to note that PfVP1 is localized to a different subcellular compartment compared to most VP1 orthologs in other protozoa. As shown in this study, PfVP1 is primarily localized to the parasite plasma membrane. In contrast, the VP1 protein of <italic toggle="yes">Trypanosoma brucei</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] or <italic toggle="yes">Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] is localized to acidocalcisomes and is used as the marker for these organelles. Interestingly, the orthologous VP1 protein in <italic toggle="yes">Toxoplasma gondii</italic> (TgVP1), another apicomplexan parasite related to <italic toggle="yes">Plasmodium</italic>, behaves drastically differently from the <italic toggle="yes">Plasmodium</italic> counterpart. TgVP1 is mainly localized to acidocalcisomes and the plant-like vacuole (PLV) [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] and despite phenotypic alterations, a complete knockout of TgVP1 is tolerated by the parasite [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">falciparum</italic>, however, the large-scale mutagenesis survey was unable to disrupt the PfVP1 gene [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. We have shown here that PfVP1 is essential for the ring stage development. Hence, the conserved VP1 proteins have seemingly adapted to perform different functions among different parasite linages even within the same phylum. It is likely that the unique bioenergetic features of <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">falciparum</italic> necessitates PfVP1 to be localized on the parasite plasma membrane, performing proton pumping by hydrolyzing PPi, not ATP.</p><p>In summary, our data suggests that <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">falciparum</italic> utilizes PfVP1 to harness energy from PPi to pump protons across the parasite plasma membrane. This process is crucial for parasite&#x02019;s development during the early phases of the asexual developmental cycle, including the ring stage and the transition from the ring to trophozoite. Additionally, the essential nature of PfVP1, coupled with its absence in humans, highlights it as a potential target for antimalarial drugs. Having a drug target in the ring stage is highly desirable for the drug development pipeline, as most antimalarials have limited efficacy against this metabolically less active stage. Indeed, efforts of developing inhibitors against H<sup><italic toggle="yes">+</italic></sup>-PPases including PfVP1 have already begun [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>Detailed steps of plasmid construction are shown in the <xref rid="ppat.1011818.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Supplementary</xref> Information.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Parasite culture, transfection, and knockdown studies</title><p>The 3D7-PfVP2KO (PfVP2 knockout) line was generated previously [<xref rid="ppat.1011818.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

</p><p>Dear Dr. Ke,</p><p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "Plasmodium falciparum utilizes pyrophosphate to fuel an essential proton pump in the ring stage and the transition to trophozoite stage" for consideration at PLOS Pathogens. As with all papers reviewed by the journal, your manuscript was reviewed by members of the editorial board and by several independent reviewers. In light of the reviews (below this email), we would like to invite the resubmission of a significantly-revised version that takes into account the reviewers' comments.</p><p>The reviewers were overall enthusiastic about the novelty and significance of this study characterizing a pyrophosphate-dependent proton pump and its essentiality for ring stage parasite development. As noted by the reviewers, the authors need to reassess the interpretations of their data and the strength of the conclusions that they draw from them. Additionally, the authors should resolve the issue raised by reviewer 2 concerning the variability of the signal ascribed to PfPV1 on Western blots in the manuscript. As suggested by the reviewer, images of full blots should be included as supplemental material.</p><p>We cannot make any decision about publication until we have seen the revised manuscript and your response to the reviewers' comments. Your revised manuscript is also likely to be sent to reviewers for further evaluation.</p><p>When you are ready to resubmit, please upload the following:</p><p>[1] A letter containing a detailed list of your responses to the review comments and a description of the changes you have made in the manuscript.&#x000a0;Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out.</p><p>[2] Two versions of the revised manuscript: one with either highlights or tracked changes denoting where the text has been changed; the other a clean version (uploaded as the manuscript file).</p><p>Important additional instructions are given below your reviewer comments.</p><p>Please prepare and submit your revised manuscript within 60 days. If you anticipate any delay, please let us know the expected resubmission date by replying to this email.

</p><p>***********************</p><p>The reviewers were overall enthusiastic about the novelty and significance of this study characterizing a pyrophosphate-dependent proton pump and its essentiality for ring stage parasite development. As noted by the reviewers, the authors need to reassess the interpretations of their data and the strength of the conclusions that they draw from them. Additionally, the authors should resolve the issue raised by reviewer 2 concerning the variability of the signal ascribed to PfPV1 on Western blots in the manuscript. As suggested by the reviewer, images of full blots should be included as supplemental material.</p><p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p><p>
<bold>Part I - Summary</bold>
</p><p>Please use this section to discuss strengths/weaknesses of study, novelty/significance, general execution and scholarship.</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#x000a0;Solebo et al address the question of how the ring stage of P.f. parasite meets its energy demands and pump protons to maintain the plasma membrane potential. This is biochemically interesting because the mitochondrion is a negligible source of ATP in the blood stages and it is unclear whether glycolysis is sufficient for its energy demands. The authors hypothesized that an ATP-independent proton pump mechanism may be a major energy source during ring stages. In this study they focused on the proton pumping pyrophosphatase PfVP1 (Plasmodium falciparum vacuolar pyrophosphatase 1). Through endogenous tagging they determined its localization to the PPM and its essentiality to ring development. They used a yeast orthologous system to verify its enzymatic activity in proton pumping and PPi hydrolysis. They were able to show that PfVP1 knockdown results in a decrease in cytosolic pH and accumulation of PPi, leading to a reversible inhibition in ring to troph transition. Functional analysis through complementation of wild type and mutant enzymes further supported their hypothesis that PfVP1 works as a PPi driven proton pump. This is a well-designed study that address an interesting question through a nice combination of cellular, genetic and biochemical approaches. The writing is clear, the results convincing and include appropriate controls. I enjoy reading the manuscript and I think that it contributes significantly to our understating of parasite&#x02019;s metabolism especially in the ring stages. I have mostly minor comments.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;Solebo et al. carry out a series of carefully-conducted experiments on one of the pyrophosphate-utilising proton pumps present in the human malaria parasite P. falciparum. The authors show that the activity of this pump is essential for the ability of the parasite to transition from the ring stage to trophozoites. This is important new information for the field. I have one main issue pertaining to the experimental work (described below) and the authors have misinterpreted a relevant paper in the field. Both of these issues should be corrected before publication. In addition, some statements in the Discussion do not appear to be supported by the data presented and these should be removed or toned-down.</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#x000a0;Clearly written, the concise new message of this paper is that the ancient and relatively low energy compound pyrophosphate, is a source of energy for P. falciparum plasma membrane proton pump pyrophosphatase PfVP1. Approaches used included study of pyrophosphatases of different organisms such as Arabidopsis Thaliana and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and skillfully employed transfection of parasite with pyrophosphatase genes to elucidate the functions of PfVP1. The paper present new and important data about the functional role of PfPV1, the unique parasite specific drug target in the early stages of P. falciparum development.</p><p>One of the most important messages of this paper is that PfVP1, an essential protein, is critical for progression of intraerythrocytic cycle of parasite development, specifically in parasite transition from ring to trophozoite stage. Parasites depleted by PfVP1 by KD can still invade RBC, change shape inside the host cells, and digest hemoglobin but they are not able to visibly grow. One of the physiological markers of successful progression to the trophozoite stage of development is the establishing of the host cell membrane permeability (New Permeability pathway, NPP), which would be an accurate indicator of the time block inflicted by PfVP1 KO on parasite life. This information is missing, unfortunately, but data could be easily obtained in the simple sorbitol lysis assay. Certainly, the transcriptome profile would clarify the developmental time of the block in PfVP1-KD parasites, and it could give some insights into the block of parasite development, but this research may be beyond the task of the first report.</p><p>However, based on the presented results, the Reviewer is not certain, that the statements like &#x0201c;&#x02026;PPi is the critical energy source for the ring stage&#x02026;&#x0201d;, or &#x0201c;the delayed ring stage&#x0201d; are correct, because parasites in ring stage survive the absence of PPi hydrolysis in KO parasites, and parasites could be recovered from the block. It would be reasonable to make a more cautious statement about the need for PPi and functional PfVP1 in parasite growth, which is also the beginning of parasite development cycle. In the last example it would be more accurate to say that parasites are delayed in transitioning into the trophozoite stage. If the authors agree with this argument, then the text should be corrected in multiple places, starting from the title.</p><p>Minor deficiencies:</p><p>1. Text could be improved in several places by more accurate wording. Line 48: death is caused by P. falciparum infection but not by all human malaria parasite infections. Line 50: the length of the developmental stages is different between parasite strains. Line 52: parasite surrounded by two additional membranes &#x02013; PVM and host PM. Page 60: missing words &#x02013; per one molecule of glucose&#x02026; Line 70: &#x0201c;immature parasite&#x0201d; is not an accurate term. Line 71: &#x0201c;Recent studies&#x0201d; need references. Line 72: &#x0201c;long period post invasion&#x0201d; is a murky definition. Line 117: missing word in &#x0201c;live cell microscopy&#x0201d; et cetera.</p><p>2. The description of PfVP1 localization is complicated with the analysis of co-localization of fluorescent signals from two proteins: PVM-embedded EXP2 and PfVP1. The close opposition of parasite and vacuolar membrane can be not be described quantitatively by fluorescent signals but requires electron microscopy analysis. The authors have, however, the sufficient fluorescent data indicating the PPM but not PVM has PfVP1: Fig 1 A shows the absence of the EXP2 in schizont PPM- invaginations decorated with PfVP1; Fig 1C clearly shows egressed merozoite with a strong VP1 fluorescence on the parasite periphery. This data is confirmed by immune-gold EM images. Authors do not have convincing evidence of other locations of VP1, and the word &#x0201c;primarily localized to the PPM&#x0201d; is not justified in the text (line 138 and in several other locations).</p><p>3. The accuracy of the statement in line 339 that &#x0201c;PfVP1 is the major proton pump in P. falciparum&#x0201d; likely needs to be rephrased. V-type ATPase is a more powerful proton pump controlling parasite pH (in trophozoites).</p><p>**********</p><p>
<bold>Part II &#x02013; Major Issues: Key Experiments Required for Acceptance</bold>
</p><p>Please use this section to detail the key new experiments or modifications of existing experiments that should be <underline>absolutely</underline> required to validate study conclusions.</p><p>Generally, there should be no more than 3 such required experiments or major modifications for a "Major Revision" recommendation. If more than 3 experiments are necessary to validate the study conclusions, then you are encouraged to recommend "Reject".</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#x000a0;(No Response)</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;Lines 140-149 &#x02013; My main issue with the manuscript is the western blots &#x02013; specifically the smearing observed, and the seemingly different sizes observed for PfVP1 in different western blots. The authors talk about a &#x0201c;regular amount&#x0201d;, but shouldn&#x02019;t the amount be optimised for the protein of interest? It was not possible to see any distinct bands in the blot shown in Figure 1E. In fact, at the expected size for the protein (79 kDa) the smearing was the weakest. The authors indicate that this issue &#x0201c;warrants further investigation&#x0201d;, but I would argue that this needs to be sorted out for the present manuscript as western blots are used throughout the study with different size aggregates (depending on the amount of protein loaded and/or antibody used) being used to support their conclusions. In light of the smearing shown in the western in Figure 1E, I also think it&#x02019;s inappropriate to then show highly cropped blots for most of the subsequent experiments. I suggest the authors include images of the full blots, if not in the main manuscript, then at least they should be included as supplementary information.</p><p>Line 134/135 &#x02013; The sentence on these two lines is incorrect. The authors are encouraged to read reference 29 carefully (in particular the last paragraph of the paper), because we certainly did not say that PfVP1 is on the food vacuole. Quite the contrary, we stated that &#x0201c;the protein [PfVP1] was not present at detectable levels in isolated digestive vacuole preparations&#x0201d;. We then went on to say &#x0201c;This&#x02026;. argues against PfVP1 being the digestive vacuole H+-PPase.&#x0201d; The data in the present manuscript therefore is consistent with the manuscript the authors state that their data contradicts!</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#x000a0;see above</p><p>**********</p><p>
<bold>Part III &#x02013; Minor Issues: Editorial and Data Presentation Modifications</bold>
</p><p>Please use this section for editorial suggestions as well as relatively minor modifications of existing data that would enhance clarity.</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#x000a0;1. Line 7 page 3 (Introduction but also in abstract), red blood cells should be mentioned before using RBC for the first time.</p><p>2. Line 107 - Please justify the use of 3D7-PfVP2KO (knockout) parasite line as a background for endogenous PfVP1 tagging and cKD instead of wild type parasites (as appear later).</p><p>3. Figure S2 &#x02013; For clarity, mark the endogenous gene in the upper illustration (PfVP1 (Pf3D7_1456800), WT) otherwise it might seem as if the insertion is on a null mutant background. 5HR is not very clear. Also, what is the green box? Why &#x0201c;new aptamers&#x0201d;. Please make the illustration more comprehensible for readers who are not well familiar with the tetR-Dozi system. Add numbers on primers in the illustration so readers can evaluate the integration test on C. Mark on A sizes in Kb that correspond to PCR fragments in C.</p><p>4. Figure 1 &#x02013; How does the RNA-seq data from S1 (little to no expression in Schizont stage) correlate with the microscopy data (notable expression in schizonts)?</p><p>5. Lines 119-121 &#x02013; Why would PfVP1 localize to the PVM during trophozoite stages?</p><p>6. Make sure title of S4 is the same in figure and in the legend in the WORD file.</p><p>7. In the attached Supplementary WORD file, legend for Figure S5 is missing and thus all subsequent legends are misnumbered and do not correspond to the main text and Sup figures numbering. Also, text in the legend does not match the text in the main article file, so it seems that this document needs to be edited and updated.</p><p>8. Line 161 - define AVP1.</p><p>9. S7 figure &#x02013; Can&#x02019;t see anything in the Ponceau staining so it&#x02019;s hard to assess whether loading was comparable to conclude the efficiency of knockdown. Additionally, why does this blot look so differently than 1E? Where is the 70-80 kDa band that corresponds to the monomeric form? Why loading so little amount if the main form cannot be detected? Quantification of knockdown would be helpful.</p><p>10. Is the effect of IDP (imidodiphosphate) similar to PfVP1 knockdown? Does it block ring to troph transition? Couldn&#x02019;t it block other, unrelated pyrophosphatases or proton pumps in P. falciparum? Does treating parasites with IDP phenocopies PfVP1 KD like in 3A, 4B or 4C? such data (which should be quite simple to obtain) would strengthen the claim that IDP acts on PfVP1 or at least blocks a similar mechanism. Please refer to the fact that IDP in its optimal concentration leads to a similar pH reduction as PfVP1 partial knockdown (before protein levels drop). A full block of PfVP1 by IDP should lead to failure in ring development already in the first cycle.</p><p>11. Figure 7 &#x02013; how come the rescue construct (Myc-tagged) migrate at 70 kDa and not 260 KDa (aggregates??) like the endogenous copy?</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;Line 46-47 &#x02013; The authors should ensure that they are using the most up to date numbers here.</p><p>Line 79 &#x02013; Reference required for membrane potential.</p><p>Line 80 &#x02013; Reference required for static pH level.</p><p>Line 97 &#x02013; Is reference 21 correct here?</p><p>Lines 94/94 &#x02013; The authors state as a fact the potassium and calcium dependence of PfVP1 and PfVP2. The authors need to clarify the basis for this statement and indicate whether or not this has been demonstrated experimentally.</p><p>Line 119 &#x02013; The statement &#x0201c;Throughout the 48 h IDC, in the trophozoite stage,&#x0201d; needs to be fixed. The parasites are not in the trophozoite stage throughout the 48 h IDC.</p><p>Line 136 &#x02013; The sentence that starts on this line is clumsy and should be amended.</p><p>Line 138 &#x02013; Not sure of the utility of Figure 1D. It actually gives the impression of cytosolic localization. I suggest the authors delete this figure.</p><p>Line 200 &#x02013; &#x0201c;are shown&#x0201d;</p><p>Line 208 &#x02013; I do not believe that &#x0201c;meanwhile&#x0201d; is being used correctly here. Perhaps it should be &#x0201c;on the other hand&#x0201d;?</p><p>Line 214 &#x02013; &#x0201c;In consistent&#x0201d; needs to be fixed.</p><p>Line 216 and elsewhere &#x02013; I suggest the authors should refrain from using the term &#x0201c;addback&#x0201d; as this is jargon, presumably a term the authors used when discussing the experiments in-house.</p><p>Line 244 &#x02013; I suggest the authors include a comment about the membrane permeability of IDP.</p><p>Line 297-298 &#x02013; I think that the statement suggesting that, based on their data, VP1 is functionally conserved throughout evolution, is far too strong and should be deleted.</p><p>Line 339 &#x02013; Seems very strange to start the Discussion section with &#x0201c;In summary&#x0201d;, especially because the last paragraph of the Discussion (line 415) also starts with &#x0201c;In summary&#x0201d;.</p><p>Line 339 &#x02013; On what basis do the authors conclude that PfVP1 is &#x0201c;the major proton pump&#x0201d;? I&#x02019;m not sure such a conclusion can be made. Yes, it is an important pump, but there could be another that is even more important (e.g. one that results in the death of ring-stage parasites (rather than their arrest) if it is functionally knocked out/down).</p><p>Line 383 &#x02013; Should be reference 53.</p><p>Line 384 &#x02013; I don&#x02019;t think that reference 54 (a review) is appropriate reference here.</p><p>Line 396-397 &#x02013; On what basis is the conclusion regarding the membrane potential made? I don&#x02019;t believe the authors have data to support this statement.</p><p>Line 399 &#x02013; Patch clamping of an intracellular organism has been achieved, but the ring stage is probably too small for the current setups. I believe this is the main problem.</p><p>The captions for the supplementary figures included in the supplementary file become out of order part way through because the caption for S5 is missing. I believe the same captions are correctly included in the main text.</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#x000a0;see above</p><p>**********</p><p>PLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (<ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history" ext-link-type="uri">what does this mean?</ext-link>).

</p><p>Dear Dr. Ke,</p><p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "Plasmodium falciparum utilizes pyrophosphate to fuel an essential proton pump in the ring stage and the transition to trophozoite stage" for consideration at PLOS Pathogens. As with all papers reviewed by the journal, your manuscript was reviewed by members of the editorial board and by several independent reviewers. The reviewers appreciated the attention to an important topic. Based on the reviews, we are likely to accept this manuscript for publication, providing that you modify the manuscript according to the review recommendations.</p><p>The authors made appropriate efforts to respond to almost all of the issues raised by the reviewers during the first round of review. The remaining issue has to do with the behavior of VP1 on Western blots. The authors included uncropped images of relevant Western blots as supplementary data, but readers will likely still be interested in potential explanations of why VP1 appears as a smear on blots and sometimes appears to differ in molecular weight. As suggested in the current review, the authors should include in the manuscript text to acknowledge the behavior of VP1 on the blots and provide some discussion/explanation for this behavior.</p><p>Please prepare and submit your revised manuscript within 30 days. If you anticipate any delay, please let us know the expected resubmission date by replying to this email.</p><p>When you are ready to resubmit, please upload the following:</p><p>[1] A letter containing a detailed list of your responses to all review comments, and a description of the changes you have made in the manuscript.</p><p>Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments.

<bold>Part I - Summary</bold>
</p><p>Please use this section to discuss strengths/weaknesses of study, novelty/significance, general execution and scholarship.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;I thank the authors for making an effort to address the comments from all three reviewers. Whilst some of the concerns have been addressed and minor errors corrected, unfortunately the only issue I had with the data remains. The issue relates to the western blots. Reviewer #1 raised a similar concern, but only as a &#x0201c;minor issue&#x0201d; (their comment 11).</p><p>Although the authors did include the full blots in the supplementary section, the issue of the smearing was not addressed. Also not addressed was the fact that the protein appears to have difference sizes on different blots depending on how much is loaded. The author&#x02019;s response to the different size issue does not make sense to me (the myc-tagged and HA-tagged copies of the protein do not appear to behave the same way on the blots). Having said this, I do believe that these issues do not impact on any of the major conclusions reached by the authors and it therefore becomes an editorial decision as to whether to accept the manuscript with the blots as they stand.</p><p>I would, however, suggest that the authors are asked to at least include some of their comments from the rebuttal into the actual manuscript so that readers of the manuscript do not have the same questions as the reviewers. An example of this is the authors&#x02019; response to comment 4 by reviewer #1, but there are a number of other similar instances that should be mentioned in the manuscript.</p><p>**********</p><p>

PACE helps ensure that figures meet PLOS requirements. To use PACE, you must first register as a user. Then, login and navigate to the UPLOAD tab, where you will find detailed instructions on how to use the tool. If you encounter any issues or have any questions when using PACE, please email us at <email>figures@plos.org</email>.</p><p>Data Requirements:</p><p>Please note that, as a condition of publication, PLOS' data policy requires that you make available all data used to draw the conclusions outlined in your manuscript. Data must be deposited in an appropriate repository, included within the body of the manuscript, or uploaded as supporting information. This includes all numerical values that were used to generate graphs, histograms etc.. For an example see here: <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001908#s5" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001908#s5</ext-link>.</p><p>Reproducibility:</p><p>To enhance the reproducibility of your results, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io, where a protocol can be assigned its own identifier (DOI) such that it can be cited independently in the future. Additionally, PLOS ONE offers an option to publish peer-reviewed clinical study protocols. Read more information on sharing protocols at <ext-link xlink:href="https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&#x00026;utm_source=authorletters&#x00026;utm_campaign=protocols" ext-link-type="uri">https://plos.org/protocols?utm_medium=editorial-email&#x00026;utm_source=authorletters&#x00026;utm_campaign=protocols</ext-link></p><p>References:</p><p>Please review your reference list to ensure that it is complete and correct. If you have cited papers that have been retracted, please include the rationale for doing so in the manuscript text, or remove these references and replace them with relevant current references. Any changes to the reference list should be mentioned in the rebuttal letter that accompanies your revised manuscript.&#x000a0;If you need to cite a retracted article, indicate the article&#x02019;s retracted status in the References list and also include a citation and full reference for the retraction notice.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="ppat.1011818.r004"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1011818.r004</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response to Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><related-article ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.ppat.1011818" id="rel-obj004" related-article-type="editor-report"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
