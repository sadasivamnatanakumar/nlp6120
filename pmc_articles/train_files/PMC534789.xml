The intracellular concentration of p53 is tightly regulated at the posttranslational level and the protein is very unstable under physiological conditions. Upon stress, p53 is stabilized and can act as a potent transcription factor that activates a plethora of downstream target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The p53 target genes can be grouped into classes according to their effect on a cell. One class is represented by p21<sup>CIP</sup>, a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor that is a potent inhibitor of the cell cycle. Another class of p53 target genes, of which bax is the most known representative, mediates p53-induced apoptosis. Other p53 target genes prevent the process of angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Not surprisingly, p53 is inactivated in a wide variety of human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Most mutations found in cancers are mis-sense mutations mapping to the central core domain of p53, which confers sequence-specific DNA binding activity to the protein. These mutations can cause destabilization of the core domain and loss of the DNA binding function. Thus, most mutant p53 proteins lack the ability to bind the DNA control elements of their target genes and fail to activate their expression. As a consequence, cells lacking functional p53 are unable to arrest the cell cycle or to undergo apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress. Since lack of p53 function plays such a central role in cancer development and in resistance to treatment, there has been much interest in the search of means and molecules to reactivate mutant forms of p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>A report by Foster et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] generated special interest since it reported the discovery of a class of small molecules that was able to stabilize the p53 core domain. Not only were these compounds reported to stabilize the active conformation of wild type p53 but they were also shown to stabilize mutant p53 forms and enable them to activate transcription of p53 target genes. While the initial screening was conducted by an <italic>in vitro </italic>assay, activity of these compounds was subsequently confirmed in cell culture experiments and in a xenograft tumor mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. One of their compounds, termed CP-31398, was reported to increase reporter gene activation by mutant p53 proteins about tenfold in the human p53-null lung carcinoma cell line H1299.</p><p>We tested CP-31398 in a yeast cell-based assay and in human tissue culture cells. We could not detect any reactivation of mutant p53 in these cellular assays. Our results are in agreement with, and provide support to the results obtained by Rippin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], which indicate that CP-31398 intercalates with DNA rather than binding p53.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>does not contain p53 homologous proteins. However, it has been demonstrated that p53 expressed in yeast can function as a potent transcriptional activator of artificial genes bearing its specific recognition sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. To test different mutant forms of p53 and the potential effect of various molecules on the activity of such mutants, we constructed a yeast strain carrying an integrated bi-directional reporter gene construct in which a single p53 binding site from the human p21<sup>CIP1 </sup>promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] was inserted between the divergent <italic>HIS3 </italic>and <italic>lacZ </italic>genes (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The p53-dependent expression of the yeast marker gene <italic>HIS3 </italic>allows growth selection on media lacking histidine and containing 3-amino-triazole (3-AT), which is a competitive inhibitor of the <italic>HIS3 </italic>gene product. The p53-dependent activation of this reporter gene is convenient for library screening, while expression of the bacterial <italic>lacZ </italic>gene allows verification and quantitation of the transcriptional activity of the various p53 forms and putative modulators.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Human p53 protein activates transcription from a reporter construct in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>.

Wild type p53 and the indicated point mutant variants were transformed into the p53 responsive reporter strain and &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity in solution was determined. The activity of wild type p53 was arbitrarily set to 100%. p53R282W and p53V173A showed about 40% of activation compared to wild type p53. No activation of the reporter gene was detected in yeast cells containing the other point mutant variants. Average and standard deviation were determined from three independent experiments.

In contrast, expression of three mutant forms of p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] with point mutations in their DNA-binding domain that completely abolish sequence-specific DNA-binding activity (p53R175H, p53R248W, p53R273H) did not activate transcription of the reporter genes (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, and data not shown). Expression of mutant forms that retain some DNA-binding activity <italic>in vitro </italic>and in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] led to reduction of reporter gene expression compared to wild type p53 (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). All p53 variants were expressed to comparable levels, as verified by western blot analysis (data not shown).</p><p>Thus, the results of these transcriptional assays, taken together with published results of experiments performed in mammalian cells, indicate that the relative transcriptional activity of wild type p53 and the tested derivatives is comparable in yeast and in human cells.</p><p>Since lack of p53 function plays such a central role in cancer development and in resistance to chemotherapeutic treatment, many efforts have been directed towards trying to reactivate mutant forms of p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The report by Foster et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] generated special interest since it presented the discovery of a small molecule (CP-31398) that was able to stabilize the core domain of p53 <italic>in vitro</italic>. In addition, this compound was reported to enable some otherwise silent p53 mutants to activate transcription from target gene promoters in cell culture experiments.</p><p>We tested the effect of CP-31398 on human p53 activity in our p53-responsive yeast strain. Yeast cells expressing either wild type p53 or the mutant p53R173A were grown in media containing increasing concentrations of CP-31398. Activation of transcription of the p53-dependent reporter gene was assessed by measuring &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity in extracts from these cells (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). No significant difference in <italic>lacZ </italic>reporter gene expression was observed between untreated cells and cells that were incubated with increasing concentrations of the compound. Very high concentrations of CP-31398 (500 &#x003bc;g/ml) reduced reporter gene activity, both in the case of wild type p53 expression and in the case of p5R173A expression. Results of growth assays on selective plates to indirectly measure <italic>HIS3 </italic>expression paralleled our data from the <italic>lacZ </italic>experiments (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Treatment with the p53 stabilizing compound CP-31398 shows no effect on reporter gene activity in yeast.

Yeast cells were treated with CP-31398 for 16 hours.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1477-5751-3-5-2"/></fig><p>Since these negative results regarding the lack of expected effects of CP-31398 on p53 could be due to our assay system in yeast, we tested CP-31398 in experiments with human tissue culture cells. We transfected the human p53-null H1299 lung carcinoma cell line that was also used for some of the experiments described by Foster et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] with plasmid DNA expressing either human wild type p53 or the p53R173A mutant together with a reporter plasmid carrying a p53-responsive luciferase gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. When we treated these cells with CP-31398 in concentrations that were shown to be effective by Foster et al. (5&#x02013;20 &#x003bc;g/ml and higher concentrations), reporter gene signals decreased and massive cell death was observed (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and data not shown). Lower concentrations that showed no obvious toxicity to the cells had no significant effect on reporter gene activity. We observed very similar effects when we performed corresponding experiments in the osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2 (p53 null cell line) (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Treatment of H1299 lung carcinoma cells with CP-31398 provokes massive cell death and p53 independent decline of luciferase reporter gene activity. (A) H1299 cells were transfected with expression constructs for wild type p53 (lanes 1&#x02013;3) and p53V173A (lanes 4&#x02013;6). All the samples were cotransfected with a p53-responsive luciferase reporter (p21 luciferase, containing a single p53 responsive p53 binding site from the human p21 promoter, termed WWP-luc, see material and methods) and a constitutive reference &#x003b2;-galactosidase construct (CMV-<italic>lacZ</italic>) for normalization.

These cells express wild type p53 protein, but p53 levels are low because of the presence of the viral HPV E6 protein, which targets p53 for degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We transfected HeLa cells with the same p53-dependent luciferase reporter construct that was used with the other cell lines and treated the cells with increasing concentrations of CP-31398 (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). To our surprise, there was a strong increase in reporter gene activation. When we expressed additional human wild type p53 from a transfection plasmid, the signal increased even more (data not shown). In contrast to the previous effect on other cell lines described above, we did not observe any significant cell death in the case of HeLa.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Treatment of HeLa cervical carcinoma cells with CP-31398 leads to p53 dependent induction of the luciferase reporter.

We found, as expected, that daunorubicin treatment led to a progressive stabilization of p53 in HeLa cells comparable to the response when cells were treated with CP-31398 (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We assessed the proposed p53 stabilizing action of CP-31398 in yeast cells and in human cells. CP-31398, a compound isolated in an antibody-based <italic>in vitro </italic>screen, was reported to stabilize the p53 DNA-binding core domain and to reactivate mutant p53 <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We were unable to detect any effect of CP-31398 on p53-dependent reporter gene activation by a mutant form of human p53 neither in human cells nor in yeast cells. In our hands, CP-31398 did not stabilize mutant p53 proteins so as to show differences in activation of p53-dependent reporter genes in yeast and in mammalian cells. In addition, concentrations that were shown to be effective in cell culture by Foster et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] led to extensive cell death. Most importantly, such cell death was independent of p53 expression.</p><p>The p53 protein expressed within yeast cells functions as a potent transcriptional activator. Reconstitution of transcriptional activation by p53 in a heterologous, yet cellular system such as a yeast cell should be suitable to assess DNA-binding and transcriptional activation activity regardless of posttranslational modifications and other influences that are inevitable when p53 is studied in the context of its regulatory network in mammalian cells. It has been proposed that such posttranslational modifications like acetylation and phosphorylation activate the latent DNA binding activity of p53 by allosteric mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, more recent <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>studies question whether DNA binding itself is regulated at all and suggest that induction of p53 activity primarily occurs at the level of increasing protein concentration within the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The evident p53 activity in yeast cells, in which the proposed mammalian-specific p53 modifying enzymes are missing, seems to be more readily consistent with the conclusions of such studies. With our system in yeast, we should be able to detect stabilization of the p53 core domain as long as this leads to increased binding of p53 to its specific DNA recognition sequence and subsequent activation of reporter gene expression. Therefore, our yeast system provides a convenient means to screen compound libraries for identifying molecules that can reactivate mutant p53 proteins in a cellular environment. Thanks to the easy genetic malleability of yeast and the lack of endogenous p53-related pathways, cellular screens with this organism should allow not only identification of compounds that can permeate cellular membranes and be active in an intracellular environment but also rapid exclusion of molecules that are not specific for the chosen target.</p><p>In contrast to the results obtained with the exogenous expression of wild type p53 in yeast cells or with the H1299 and Saos-2 human cells, we observed a strong increase in wild type p53-dependent reporter gene activation in HeLa cells. These cells showed no apparent cell death after treatment with CP-31398. Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] reported stabilization of wild type p53 and an increase in p53 levels in other cell lines. These observations are consistent with the results we obtained in HeLa cells. These authors also reported that ubiquitination and degradation of wild type p53 is blocked by CP-31398. This effect seems to be specific to mdm2-mediated p53 degradation since HPV (human papilloma virus) E6-mediated degradation of p53 was unaffected. We do not know why we do not see any stabilization of exogenous p53 in H1299 or Saos-2 cells, but it is possible that unspecific toxicity induced by CP-31398 masks the increasing p53-dependent reporter signal. While these results indicate that CP-31398 might stabilize wild type p53, they do not explain the mechanism. Direct interaction and stabilization of p53 is not excluded. However, other explanations seem plausible. Stabilization of the core domain structure by CP-31398 as proposed in the original article should presumably have no effect on p53 protein levels. But p53 levels increase after treatment with CP-31398. Such a response is in line with a classical stabilisation of p53 after genotoxic stress. In contrast, Wang et al. reported that no serine 15 or 20 phosphorylation was detected in their cells after treatment with CP-31398. Interaction with mdm2 was unaffected, but p53 degradation was nevertheless blocked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Therefore, it remains unclear by which mechanism CP-31398 stabilizes p53; it seems unlikely that core domain stability and DNA binding are influenced by CP-31398 directly. It is interesting to note that CP-31398 can intercalate into DNA as reported by Rippin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This intercalation is probably toxic to the cell and likely induces a classical p53 response, similar to the known p53 inducer daunorubicin.</p><p>Our results strongly suggest a classical p53 stabilization through reduced degradation due to genotoxic effects caused by CP-31398. In fact, wild type p53 levels changed quite dramatically in HeLa cells, which are resitant to the apoptotic effects of p53, whereas the other human cell lines did not survive the treatment, probably because they underwent apoptosis in response to CP-31398 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In support to this interpretation, our control substance daunorubicin showed very similar and expected results as those obtained with CP-31398.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In contrast to the results reported by Foster et al.

Cells for luciferase assays and western blotting were harvested by scraping 48 hours after transfection and subjected to three freeze thaw cycles in 100 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.8 1 mM dithiothreitol buffer. Supernatants were clarified by centrifugation (5 min, 13000 rpm) and resuspended in 100 &#x003bc;l extraction buffer. 10 &#x003bc;l of extract was mixed with 100 &#x003bc;l luciferase assay solution (Promega) and analyzed in a luminometer (EG&#x00026;G Berthold Lumat LB 9507). &#x003b2;-galactosidase assays were performed according to standard methods using 50 &#x003bc;l of the extract and luciferase units were normalized according to &#x003b2;-galactosidase values. All measurements were performed from at least two independent transfections experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot analysis and antibodies</title><p>Protein extracts were prepared as described above. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and western blotting was performed according to standard procedures. Anti-p53 antibody DO-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc) reacts with an amino terminal epitope mapping between amino acid residues 11&#x02013;25 of wild type and mutant p53. Anti-actin antibody (I-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc) is an affinity purified goat polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide mapping to the carboxy terminus of human actin.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All experimental work was carried out by ST.
