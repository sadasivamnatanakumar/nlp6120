By alleviating this early stress, on-farm hatching is thought to improve animal welfare, yet little is known about its effects throughout production. This study compared welfare indicators and spatial behaviours during the laying period of hens hatched in an on-farm environment (OFH) to those hatched in a commercial hatchery and transferred at one day-old to a rearing barn (STAN). In particular, we assessed how OFH and TRAN hens differed in space-use and movement behaviours following the transfer to the laying barn at 17 weeks of age, a similar stressor encountered by STAN hens early in life, and determined whether effects aligned more with the &#x02019;silver-spoon&#x02019; or &#x02019;environmental matching&#x02019; hypothesis. We found that for the first three months post-transfer into the laying barn, OFH hens, on average, transitioned less between the aviary&#x02019;s tiers and spent less time on the littered floor. Because OFH hens became behaviourally more similar to STAN hens over time, these results suggest that OFH hens required a prolonged period to establish their daily behavioural patterns. Furthermore, OFH hens had more severe keel bone fractures throughout the laying period but similar feather damage and body mass to STAN hens. No differences were found in hen mortality or the number of eggs per live hen. These findings support the environmental matching hypothesis and suggest that early-life stressors may have prepared hens for later-life stressors, underscoring the importance of both early-life and adult environments in enhancing animal welfare throughout production.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

Chicks in hatcheries, are subjected to loud noise during incubation (~90dB), hatched in darkness, prevented from accessing feed, water, or litter, and subjected to sexing, vaccination, and transportation to rearing farms at one day of age [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The early exposure to stressors can be alleviated by hatching chicks on farm, where chicks are transported before hatching and have direct access to feed, water and litter.</p><p>Exposure to less stressful environmental conditions during development may have a positive impact on various aspects of individual fitness later on, a phenomenon called &#x0201c;silver-spoon&#x0201d; effect [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] (for a review on birds and mammals, see [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]). The silver-spoon hypothesis suggests that individuals who experience relatively better environmental conditions during development, such as characterized by reduced stressors or abundant nutritional availability, may be able to cope better when confronted with adversity later in life. Accordingly, it is not surprising that on-farm hatching has been shown to improve the well-being of broilers and laying hens later in life, in particular throughout development. Specifically, this practice has been shown to reduce total mortality [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and footpad dermatitis [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295560.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] of broilers, and increase body mass [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295560.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295560.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and reduce feather damage, comb injuries, and corticosterone reactivity during restraint [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] of laying hens.</p><p>Alternatively, by experiencing adverse environments during development, one may be prepared or adapted to handle similar adversities in the future. The &#x0201c;environmental matching&#x0201d; hypothesis suggests that environmental conditions in early life shape an individual phenotype via developmental plasticity [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], so that an individual is adapted to similar environmental conditions experienced earlier in life [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295560.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, chicks that hatched in a commercial hatchery and subsequently transported on farm could have a phenotype more adapted to aversive environments, such as transportation to a new environment, than chicks hatched on-farm. Thus, the benefit of a less aversive early life environment would depend on the environmental conditions experienced later in life [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, studies evaluating the effect of the commercial hatchery process on adult laying hens in commercial settings are scarce, limiting our understanding of their long-term effects on hen welfare. The limited understanding is especially true for health issues that predominantly arise during adulthood or may worsen as hens age, such as feather damage [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295560.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] or keel bone fractures (KBF) [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295560.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus, a long-term approach is necessary to understand whether on-farm hatching improves hen welfare throughout production, or whether its relative benefits are eventually offset by later stressors that they are unable to manage.</p><p>In this study, we compared the severity of KBF, feather damage, body mass and spatial behaviours of laying hens hatched on-farm (OFH) to those hatched in a commercial hatchery and transferred at one day of age to the farm (STAN). Our goal was to determine if, and for how long, these two different environments experienced at one day of age could account for variations in animal welfare and behaviour during the laying period. We assessed how the transfer from the rearing to the laying barn, a similar stressor encountered by day-old STAN chicks, affected space-use and movement behaviours, as well as welfare indicators. We aimed to determine whether the observed effects aligned more with the &#x02019;silver-spoon&#x02019; or &#x02019;environmental matching&#x02019; hypothesis. The former hypothesis would be supported if OFH hens would display overall greater welfare compared to STAN hens, while the latter hypothesis would be supported if OFH would display overall worse welfare conditions. Better welfare could be here manifested via less severe KBF, reduced feather damage, and greater time spent in the littered floor and the winter garden. These areas provide enhanced opportunities for the expression of natural behaviours such as locomotion, exploring, foraging, scratching, and dust bathing, which are important for laying hen welfare [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295560.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethical note</title><p>The research was conducted in accordance with the cantonal and federal regulations for the ethical treatment of experimentally used animals.

At 18 days of development, three days before hatching, 3,300 eggs were arbitrarily chosen as part of the on-farm hatch (OFH) treatment and all except 270 clear eggs transported to a commercial rearing barn at the Aviforum facilities in Switzerland. The eggs were transported in a commercial vehicle for less than 1.5 hours, which maintained a stable environmental temperature at an average of 36.4&#x000b0;C. Eggs were positioned in HatchTech Setter Trays 15 cm above the littered floor, where feed, water, and litter were available. We monitored environmental conditions and temperature of 30 eggs every six hours throughout the hatching process. Specifically, we ensured that the ambient relative humidity remained above 30%, the windspeed below 0.15 m/s, ambient temperature above 32&#x000b0;C, and the eggshells temperature between 35&#x02013;38&#x000b0;C (see <xref rid="pone.0295560.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref> for eggshell temperature over time). Our methodology is similar to a previous study conducted on layer chicks [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>At one day of age (DOA), OFH chicks were manually sexed by examining their wing feathers for sex-specific patterns and females were vaccinated (IB 4/91). On the same day, 1,200 chicks from the commercial hatchery were transported to the rearing barn as part of the STAN treatment. Transportation took place in a commercial vehicle over a duration of eight hours, during which a consistent environmental temperature around 28&#x000b0;C was maintained. Unlike the OFH chicks, STAN chicks&#x02014;in addition to being transported to new housing&#x02014;hatched in darkness and were deprived direct access to food, water, or litter after hatching until arrival at the rearing barn. Similar to OFH chicks, STAN chicks were vaccinated and manually sexed by examining their wing feathers for sex-specific patterns at the hatchery facility. Although both OFH and TRAN chicks were manually sexed by the same company managing the post-hatch procedures (Prodavi SA, CH), we supervised the sorting of OFH chicks and encouraged the sexers to proceed gently, however no objective comparison was made of the handling procedures between treatment groups. STAN chicks were used to populate two rearing pens and OFH chicks were used to populate the other two pens (600 hens/pen). Males and surplus females were returned to the hatchery for humane disposal. At seven DOA all chicks were classified into a more/less explorer class. We did not use the class as an exploratory behaviour as the measurement could not be validated (<xref rid="pone.0295560.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref>), though we controlled for the class in subsequent analysis. Simultaneously, 160 focal birds (40 hens/rearing pen) were selected from the 2&#x02019;400 chicks. Of the 160 focal birds, 80 focal birds were classified as MEXP or LEXP (40 / class), while 80 were selected as a representative sample and used for another study that collected brain tissues throughout the laying period.</p><p>At 119 DOA, all hens were caught, put into a crate, and transported to one of eight laying pens on the same site (225 hens/pens, including 20 focal hens, four pens/treatment). Bird density was 8.1 hens per square-meter of permanent accessible area (225 hens/27.92 <italic toggle="yes">m</italic><sup>2</sup>). The laying barn contained a quasi-commercial multi-tier aviary system (Bolegg Terrace separated into 20 pens by grids illustrated in <xref rid="pone.0295560.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>; indoor length x width x height until the top tier grid floor: 7 x 2.3 x 2.69 m; previously described [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]) and an outside covered winter garden (WG; 9.32 <italic toggle="yes">m</italic><sup>2</sup>) accessible by pop holes from 10:00 h to 16:00 h on most days. On the day of transfer to the laying barn the 160 focal hens were assigned a tracking device to continuously register their transitions across the indoor aviary levels and the winter garden (WG) until near the end of production (tracking period: September 2020 &#x02013;July 2021). At five time points during the laying period (DOA: 127, 173, 243, 313, and 418), 16 randomly selected focal hens were killed (eight hens/treatment) to collect brain tissues as part of a separate study. Each of these time points also included welfare assessment (described in the below section), except for DOA 127, which was replaced by DOA 215 to capture more variation in animal welfare. For each hen killed, another hen from the same pen was arbitrarily selected to continuously track the same number of hens, for a total of 227 hens used in the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Welfare indicators</title><p>Welfare assessment included feather damage, radiographs for KBF, and body mass (digital scale in grams). During the welfare assessment, the observers were blinded to the treatment, laying pen identity, and hen class, and shown reliable in a previous effort for both feather damage and KBF severity scores [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The feather damage score (continuous, 0&#x02013;100) was assigned using the photographs of white laying hens which we rescaled to 0&#x02013;100 and took the complement to 100 so that higher scores are indicative of poorer welfare (score 1: approx. 100&#x02013;76 depending on the extent of damage; score 2: approx. 75&#x02013;51; etc.) for each body part [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. More precisely, we assigned a score of the breast, tail, and neck, but not the back and wing feathers as these could not be reliably assessed because of the backpack containing the tracking tag (described below). We then averaged these to get an overall individual feather damage score. We assessed KBF severity (continuous, 0&#x02013;100) based on the latero-lateral radiographs using the scoring methodology described by Rufener et al. [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], where the score is described as an indicator of the total amount of keel bone affected by fractures. We excluded the first timepoint of KBF severity and feather damage, as there was little variation, with both having a median score of zero.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Spatial behaviours</title><p>We tracked individuals&#x02019; transitions across five zones: the four different levels of the aviary (top tier, nestbox tier, lower tier, and littered floor) and the outside covered WG. We used a low-frequency tracking system with active tags (mass: 28.1 g) enclosed in a backpack mounted on the back of the hens (see Montalcini et al. (2022) [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] for the validation and description). Tracking data were collected from the first full day in the laying barn (DOA 119) until near the end of production (DOA 416). We excluded days with known disturbances (e.g., vaccinations or welfare assessments) and those with known tracking system malfunctions (e.g., low battery level). Subsequent analysis involved a period of 297 days of tracking, during which hens had on average 169 days tracked, with a minimum of three days tracked and a maximum of 250 days, involving a total of 227 hens and 38,303 hen-days observations.</p><p>We characterized the daily movement and space-use behaviours of each hen with six behaviours expressed while artificial light was provided. We used the (i) vertical travelled distance, defined as the total number of indoor tiers crossed, to account for the level of vertical movement. We used the proportion of the indoor time spent on the (ii) top tier, (iii) nestbox tier, and (iv) littered floor to account for indoor space-use behaviours, and (v) WG presence (yes/no) to account for the outdoor space-use behaviour. Finally, because the nestbox tier is of particular interest within commercial settings, we also used the (vi) time when a hen reached half of its nestbox tier duration, accounting only for hours where hens are expected to lay, that is between 02:00h and 08:00h, hereafter referred to as the nestbox tier timing.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Production traits</title><p>The female hatchability, i.e., the percentage of healthy female hatched, was 40% in the hatchery and 42.6% on-farm within a hatching window duration of 65 hours (for the on-farm chicks, see <xref rid="pone.0295560.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref> for the hatching rate over time), was comparable to previously reported OFH results [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. During the rearing period, there was a total of 11 deaths for each treatment (i.e., &#x0003c; 1%). We analyse production traits after the transfer to the laying barn, as hens had not laid eggs prior to that point. First, we used the number of early deaths per day in each pen during the laying phase. This dataset is right censored where the value 1 represents death, and 0 indicates being alive. Second, we used the hen daily average (average number of nest eggs per live hen) in each pen. Throughout the laying period, eggs laid inside the nestboxes were collected consistently at the same time every day and counted at the pen-level. We did not include floor eggs in our analysis as they represent approximately 0.24% of total eggs laid. In addition to the four pens per treatment group (STAN and OFH) with focal birds, we also used the data of two additional pens without focal hens but containing 205 birds from one treatment group with an additional 20 Lohmann LSL hens that hatched in the hatchery (called &#x0201c;special pens&#x0201d;).</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Statistics</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Welfare indicators</title><p>Statistical analyses were conducted in R version 3.6.1. To evaluate treatment effects on hen&#x02019;s welfare indicators, we fitted one linear mixed-effect model from the &#x02018;lme4&#x02019; package per welfare indicator (body mass, KBF severity, and feather damage) as a function of date (or health assessment identity), treatment, and date-treatment interaction. We controlled for class and included hen identity nested in pen identity as a random term. Pen identity was removed when fitting the KBF severity and body mass due to low variance leading to convergence issues. We scaled body mass to be within 0&#x02013;1 within each welfare assessment separately prior to the model fit. Model assumptions were checked visually (normality and homoscedasticity of residuals). To assess significance of the date-treatment interaction, we compared each model with a model that did not contain the interaction variable using the function Anova from R. When the date-treatment interaction was significant (p &#x0003c; 0.05), we reported results from a post-hoc analysis with adjusted p-values (Bonferroni adjustment, package &#x0201c;emmeans&#x0201d;). When the date-treatment interaction was not significant, we removed it from the model and assessed significance of the treatment as a main effect by comparing the full and reduced models.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Spatial behaviours</title><p>To evaluate whether treatment groups differed in mean behaviours after the transfer to the laying barn, we fitted one generalized linear mixed-effect model from the package &#x02018;glmmTMB&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] for each behaviour for the first month in the laying barn. To complement the findings and evaluate how long treatment groups differed in mean behaviours, we fitted models for each following month as well (10 months, six behaviours, total of 60 models), as a function of the treatment (with STAN as reference group). We chose month as the unit to analyse treatment effect over time, aiming to strike a balance between thoroughly estimating mean effects over time and avoiding potential noise linked to shorter time intervals like weeks. A previous study on the same hens, studying intra-individual variation in a composite behaviour, found that, on average, hens increased their indoor movements for 39 days after the transfer to the laying barn [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This previous result suggests that the transfer to the laying barn could have a long-term effect on hens&#x02019; spatial behaviours. However, we expected that any treatment differences in spatial behaviours would appear directly after the transfer to the laying barn and diminish over time. Therefore, any statistically significant treatment effect that does not follow that pattern was interpreted with care, and the results section emphasized coefficient estimates rather than p-values. We controlled for the class, time (defined as the number of days since the transfer to the laying barn), KBF severity, body mass, and number of hours with artificial lights on, by including them as fixed effects. We interpolated linearly (with monotonically increasing) both the KBF severity score and body mass for each hen separately to better control for their health between two consecutive health assessments considering that both scores exhibit an upward trend over time. The hen identity nested in the pen identity was included as a random term. To avoid convergence issues due to the very low explained variance by the pen identity, we performed a likelihood ratio test with and without the pen identity and chose the full model when the p-value was &#x0003c; 0.05. For the WG-related behaviour, we also controlled for the number of hours the WG was accessible and the average daily external temperature (&#x000b0;C), taken from the LSZB weather station (~12 km from the barn) and accessed via the Wolfram alpha API in Python. All continuous variables were scaled by two times the deviation to obtain coefficients comparable to those of binary predictors (i.e., the treatment) [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. As the first full day in the laying barn coincided with the final day of September, we incorporated that day into the models for the first month (October).</p><p>The vertical travelled distance was modelled with a gaussian family for months 2&#x02013;10 and with a zero-inflated Poisson model with the rescaled number of days in the barn as the zero-inflation parameter for month 1, as model assumption were otherwise not met. The nestbox tier usage was modelled with a gamma family (with a log-link function) and the WG presence with a binomial family (with a logit-link function). The proportion of indoor time spent on the top and nestbox tiers were both modelled with a <italic toggle="yes">beta</italic> family (with a logit-link function). The proportion of the indoor time spent on the littered floor was modelled with a gaussian family for months 2&#x02013;10 and with a binomial family (with a logit-link function) to account for the excess of zeros (19.7% of observations) for month 1. Behaviours used in a beta distribution were first rescaled between 0.01 and 0.99. During the first month in the laying barn, hens had not reached the peak of production and the artificial light was turned on later in the day (days 1&#x02013;9 at 9h, days 10&#x02013;16 at 8h, days 17&#x02013;22 at 7h, days 23&#x02013;24 at 6h, days 25&#x02013;30 at 5h, days 31&#x02013;32 at 4h). Therefore, we did not analyse the first month in the laying barn for the two nestbox tier related behaviours because behaviours expressed during that first month would likely not be comparable with behaviours expressed in subsequent months. In addition, we did not use the first seven days when fitting the WG presence, as the opening of the WG was delayed until normal laying behavior commenced (i.e., the eighth day) as is common for commercial practices. Residuals were simulated using the &#x02018;DHARMa&#x02019; package to verify model assumptions (normality and homoscedasticity of the residuals). We reported the bootstrapped coefficients [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], credible intervals, and p-values computed from the &#x02018;parameters&#x02019; package using 500 iterations.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Production traits</title><p>To analyse daily mortality, we first estimated survival curves per treatments (without the special pens) and per pen (with the two special pens) using the Kaplan-Meier method with the &#x02018;survival&#x02019; package in R [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Then, we used the log-rank test to test whether the treatment group (with the two special pens) differ in their survival curves. In order to account for the pen identities as a random effect and the &#x0201c;special pens&#x0201d; as a fixed effect, we also fitted a Cox proportional hazards models with both fixed and random effects, using the &#x02018;coxme&#x02019; package in R [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Because it is a fundamental assumption of both the log-rank test and the Cox proportion hazard test that the hazard ratio is constant over time [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], we tested the proportional hazards assumption. We found that the effect of both the pen identity, special pen effect, and the treatment covariates were not time-dependant (p&#x0003c;0.05). However, because there was a trend (p = 0.06) suggesting that the effect treatment had on the time until death may not be constant over time, we also split the data into two sets [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], considering the first 60 days in the laying barn (when there is a peak of mortality) and the remaining production period. The effect of treatment no longer was time dependent, and the effect of treatment remained the same. Therefore, we reported the result from the model with the full rather than split time period.</p><p>We analysed the daily average number of eggs per live hen in each pen using a sigmoid curve, <inline-formula id="pone.0295560.e001"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0295560.e001.jpg" id="pone.0295560.e001g" position="anchor"/><mml:math id="M1" display="inline" overflow="scroll"><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, where <italic toggle="yes">time</italic> represented by the number of days since being in the laying barn, <italic toggle="yes">a</italic> as the horizontal asymptote, <italic toggle="yes">m</italic> as the time point at <italic toggle="yes">a</italic>/2, and <italic toggle="yes">s</italic> as the steepness of the curve at <italic toggle="yes">a</italic>/2 [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

More specifically, we found an odds ratio of 0.30 (95% CI [0.12, 0.67], p &#x0003c; 0.01), meaning that the odds of going on the littered floor at least once during the day (during the first month) in OFH hens were 0.30 times the odds in STAN hens. A similar effect was maintained during months 2 and 3 (with a gaussian family; <xref rid="pone.0295560.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). More specifically, compared to STAN hens, OFH hens spent 7% and 5% less of their daily indoor time on the littered floor during months 2 and 3, respectively (month 2: &#x003b2; [95% CI] = -0.07 [-0.11, -0.02], p = 0.008; month 3: &#x003b2; [95% CI] = -0.05 [-0.11, -0.00], p = 0.04).

We found no treatment effect on the daily presence in the WG, almost none on the two nestbox tier related behaviours, and none in body mass, feather damage, survival probability, and number of egg per live hens. To our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the potential effects of the standard commercial hatchery process throughout the laying period on commercial hens&#x02019; welfare and spatial behaviour, and in particular to assess the effect on KBF. These findings suggest that early-life stressors associated with the commercial hatchery environment&#x02013;here, transport-related stressors and temporary post-hatch resource deprivation&#x02013;may have prepared hens for their adult environment and thereby support the environmental matching hypothesis.</p><sec id="sec017"><title>Welfare indicators</title><p>According to the environmental matching hypothesis, early-life stress can prepare an individual for similar adversities encountered in adulthood [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The adulthood of commercial laying hens is typically accompanied by aversive situations, including the transfer to the laying barn [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The potential stressors associated with this transfer, such as being transported to a new housing with new conspecifics, echo those encountered by STAN chicks. Therefore, the adult environment of commercial hens may better match with the environmental conditions experienced by day-old STAN chicks rather than those of day-old OFH chicks.</p><p>The result showing less severe KBF in STAN hens across the laying period compared to OFH hens provides support for the environmental matching hypothesis. Although KBF are considered as one of the greatest welfare issues in the egg production industry [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295560.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295560.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], effects of early-life stressors induced by commercial hatchery on KBF was to our knowledge not yet investigated. Various factors are thought to contribute to the prevalence of KBF, including genetic predisposition [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], nutrition [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], de-mineralized bone aggravated by the high egg laying rate [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], inactivity compromising bone health [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and certain physical elements of the housing system that may cause pressure on the bone when hens are perching [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] or lead to trauma resulting from impact collisions [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295560.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295560.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295560.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Given that the STAN and OFH hens originated from the same parent flock, it is unlikely that genetic predisposition could explain this result. Moreover, apart from the nutritional differences after hatching, where OFH chicks had immediate access to feed and water, which is unlikely to negatively impacted their bone health, both STAN and OFH hens received the same nutrition. Because we observed minor differences in egg-production during the onset of lay, which, if anything, would suggest that OFH hens had a slower onset of lay, it is also unlikely that these differences would explain the result.</p><p>Given the limited amount of genetic and environmental differences between treatment groups outside of the treatment specific differences, we believe behavioural differences in activity and/or different usage of the housing system could explain why OFH hens had more severe KBF compared to STAN hens. For instance, our finding indicating a 31% reduction in vertical travelled distance during the first month for hens hatched on farms, may reflect a more general pattern of inactivity among OFH hens which could lead to poorer bone health and in turn higher KBF [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Additionally, OFH hens spent more time on the top tier, where hard metal perches are more abundant. High perch use would result in overall greater pressure on the keel bone leading to deviated keels, which in turn can weaken the keel&#x02019;s overall structural integrity [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Overall, we cannot exclude the possibility that the treatment difference we observed in the severity of KBF may be an indirect effect of the differences we observed in spatial behaviours between the treatment groups. Further research is required to replicate this finding and to understand the underlying mechanisms involved.</p><p>More recent evidence suggested that factors related to egg production, including internal pressure during the egg-laying process [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295560.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and an early onset of lay [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], could favour KBF. We found no evidence of treatment effect in the average number of egg per live hens, nor did we observe treatment effect on the timing of the onset of lay. In fact, a previous study showed that on-farm hatched hens had a slower onset of egg-laying than hens hatched in commercial hatchery at 15&#x02013;20 weeks of age [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Hence, while an early onset of laying may not explain the treatment effect on KBF observed in our study, it is plausible that other factors related to the internal pressure during the egg-laying process could be operating in the current effort.</p><p>We found that OFH hens had on average a similar body mass to STAN hens beginning with our earliest measurement at 7 DOA. We expected OFH hens to weigh more because of direct access to feed after hatching, which previous studies on day-old chicks demonstrated [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295560.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295560.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], but also because it is possible that animals may gain less weight due to early life stress [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295560.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. However, beyond one day of age, the effect in previous literature is ambiguous. Studies contrasting on-farm hatching to standard commercial practices found no treatment differences at 4 or 7 DOA [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295560.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], a tendency for on-farm hatched chicks to weigh more up to 11 weeks of age [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and that on-farm hatched chicks weighed less at 8, 15, 22 and 29 DOA [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Our study provides more evidence that treatment effects of body mass are not present during lay.</p><p>Furthermore, OFH hens had similar feather damage to STAN hens, which supports neither the silver-spoon nor the environmental matching hypothesis, but is in line with the inconclusive findings in earlier literature that reported both positive [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and negative [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] effects. The ambiguity surrounding these results may stem from the multifactorial nature of feather damage, which includes factors such as feather pecking and abrasion resulting from different parts of the structures [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Therefore, the influences of the physical and social environments on feather damage could outweigh or interact with effects from early-life stressors.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Spatial behaviours</title><p>The literature on behavioural differences between hens that hatched on-farm versus in a commercial hatchery is sparse and mainly conducted in test arenas [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295560.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295560.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], hindering the extrapolation of the results to commercial settings, typically characterized by more complex housing systems and larger groups. In this study, we used tracking technology to monitor movements of hens within a quasi-commercial aviary system throughout the laying period.</p><p>We found that for the first three months post-transfer to the laying barn (up to 7-month-old) STAN hens spent more time on the littered floor and less on the top tier. The top tier has been shown to be used more extensively by hens with more severe keel bone fractures [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and throughout full days following their transfer to the laying barn [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] (in a previous study on the same hens). Thus, it is possible that hens use this area over the day to offset stress or pain. Unlike the top tier, the littered floor promotes a diverse range of natural behaviours, including locomotion, dust bathing, exploring, foraging, and scratching. Therefore, these findings could indicate that OFH hens exhibited fewer natural behaviours compared to STAN hens in this early laying barn period. Furthermore, as OFH hens became behaviourally more similar to STAN hens over time (<xref rid="pone.0295560.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), these results further suggest that OFH hens required a prolonged period to establish their daily behavioural patterns. Overall, STAN hens may have exhibited better abilities in coping with the transfer to the laying barn, which would provide further support for the environmental matching hypothesis. Early-life stress can enhance behavioural flexibility [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], improve stress coping later in life [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], and facilitate spatial learning and memory [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295560.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], especially when experienced close in time and within the same context that is encountered later [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Therefore, increased stress induced by the commercial hatchery process near the time of transfer to the rearing barn could have induced focused attention and improved the memory of relevant information allowing STAN hens to better cope to the laying barn.</p><p>In addition to the potential effect of early-life stressors, it is possible that the STAN chicks may have exhibited faster acclimatization to their new environment due to the inherent effects of their transition from the hatchery to the farm. As suggested by Sk&#x000e5;nberg et al. [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], it is possible that environmental change during rearing plays a role in enhancing layer chicks&#x02019; adaptability later in life. Specifically, STAN hens may have learned appropriate cognitive and locomotive skills during the rearing period, facilitating their adaptation to the aviary system. However, a previous study comparing the cognitive ability of layer chicks that had temporary post-hatch resource deprivation and eight-hour transport, to those that had ad libitum access to feed and water and were not transported, found no treatment effect in a cognitive test [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Further research is needed to investigate whether STAN hens possess better spatial-cognitive abilities in the laying period.</p><p>It is also possible that the additional early-life stressors experienced by STAN hens could have altered the functional and structural development of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA)-axis [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295560.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Typically, stress induced in the early postnatal period results in HPA-axis hyper-reactivity during adulthood [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], with enhanced depression-like behaviours and anxiety [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Previous studies on laying hens generally supports such alterations of the HPA-axis. It was shown that hens from a commercial hatchery had a more sensitive HPA-axis and a stronger reaction to stressors during the first weeks of life compared to on-farm hatched hens [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295560.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Here, we showed that STAN hens spent more time on the littered floor, less time on the top tier, and exhibited their typical behavioural patterns earlier after the transfer to the laying barn, in comparison to OFH hens. We believe that these behavioural pattern are not indicative of a stronger reaction to the transfer, and therefore believe that the additional early-life stressors experienced by STAN hens may not have significantly impacted their HPA-axis. Alternatively, it is also possible that the subsequent adversities encountered by all chicks in the rearing barn could have triggered the HPA axis of OFH hens to reach conditions resembling that of the STAN hens [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. However, further research is necessary to understand how transportation and early life conditions influence the HPA-axis and its relationship to movement in laying hens.</p><p>We found almost no treatment effect on the two nestbox tier behaviours, which supports the idea of limited behavioural plasticity related to the use of the nestbox tier. Given the strong human selection for high productivity and the high motivation to use nestboxes [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], it is possible that those behaviours are more tightly correlated with physiology or with strong animal needs and thus are less plastic than others. That is, these behaviours may be less influenced by external or internal factors and more repeatable across different contexts, as suggested by previous findings [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295560.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Production traits</title><p>Until <italic toggle="yes">in ovo</italic> sexing becomes practical at commercial scale, differences between hatchery and on-farm treatments may not have practical effects relevant to animal welfare. However, with the advancement of <italic toggle="yes">in ovo</italic> sexing techniques [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], it is possible that on-farm hatching practices will become a standard method in the future. Therefore, it is important to compare both animal welfare and productivity between commercial hatchery and on-farm treatments within commercially relevant settings. We found no treatment effect on mortality, despite on-farm practices have already been shown to reduce total mortality in broilers [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We also found no treatment effect on the average number of egg per live hens in terms of both the level at which it stabilized (i.e., parameter <italic toggle="yes">a</italic>) and the time point at which the curve reached its inflection point (i.e., parameter <italic toggle="yes">m</italic>). To our knowledge, only two studies [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295560.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] have compared egg-production between such treatments, by collecting daily production data at the pen-level. The authors found that OFH hens had a slower onset of egg laying than STAN hens at 15&#x02013;20 weeks of age [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] in one study and laid more and bigger eggs at 19&#x02013;25 weeks of age in the second [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The absence of a statistical difference in our study may be attributed to the limited sample size and further research with substantially more pens or at the individual-level is needed to determine whether there are differences in egg-production between on-farm hatched hens and those hatched in commercial hatcheries.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study aimed to assess the potential impact of commercial hatchery practices and potential benefits of on-farm hatching for animal welfare within commercially relevant settings throughout most of the production period. Some potential early life stressors were in this study uniquely experienced by STAN animals, including food and water deprivation [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] and the transportation at one day of age to a new environment [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Yet, the hatchery-related procedures applied to OFH chicks might also have been aversive, including the transportation at 18 days of incubation [<xref rid="pone.0295560.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] and the vaccination and sexing at one day of age. We designed the experiment so that all hatchery-related procedures should be less, or when not possible, equally, aversive for the OFH treatment compared to the TRAN treatment. However, our methodology did not allow to determine if the increased cumulative adversities encountered by STAN chicks during their development led to higher stress responses than those seen in OFH chicks. Hence, to assess the relative benefit of on-farm hatching practices for practical applications, future research should compare physiological stress and cognitive responses between treatment in the rearing and laying phase and strive to replicate on-farm hatching procedures more closely to the envisioned future practices (e.g., integrating <italic toggle="yes">in ovo</italic> sexing for the OFH treatment).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec021"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Hens from both treatments originated from the same parent flock yet produced different phenotypes depending on their early-life environments, suggesting the presence of developmental plasticity in our commercial hens. By providing nuance to the relative benefit of on-farm hatching for animal welfare described by previous literature, this study highlighted the critical role in designing early-life environments in accordance with the adult environment. For laying hens housed in aviary systems, our results could suggest that hatching on-farm rather than in commercial hatchery may lead to an increased mismatch between the hatching and laying environments that can be detrimental to animal welfare. We conclude that future research is needed to determine whether conventional husbandry practices, originally designed for hens hatched in commercial hatcheries, need to be adapted for hens hatched on-farm, such as implementing smoother transfers between rearing to laying barns.</p></sec><sec id="sec022" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0295560.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>More/less explorer class.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0295560.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0295560.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Eggshell temperature over time.</title><p>We monitored 30 OFH eggs every six hours, for a total of 7 timestamps, until a significant proportion of the chicks hatched.</p><p>(PNG)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0295560.s002.png"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0295560.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Parameter estimates of the sigmoid curve per pen.</title><p>Parameter <italic toggle="yes">a</italic> may be viewed as an indication of the level at which egg production stabilise.

<bold>Reviewer1</bold>
</p><p>A very interesting paper on an important topic. I would like the authors to attend to the following comments and suggestions:</p><p>- The eggs were transported on day 18 of incubation to the on-farm hatch system. Please consider the possible stress this may have induced on the embryos. Recent research has showed that the embryos may be susceptible to stress at this point and this may have affected your results (Nordquist, R.E., Vernooij, J.C.M., Dull, C.L., Pascual, A., van der Linde, G., Goerlich, V.C., 2022. The effects of transport of 18-day old hatching eggs on physiology and behaviour of slow growing broiler chicken. Applied Animal Behaviour Science 257.)</p><p>- The newly hatched chicks were manually sexed - please provide more information on how this was done and how this may possibly have affected the chicks that remained in the experiment.</p><p>- I think the egg production data should in fact be possible to test in a more rigorous statistical manner. Although I appreciate that there were only five pens per treatment, a statistical evaluation would be helpful in order to validate the findings.</p><p>- The differences between treatment groups in KBF are surprising (to me at least) and I think the authors should consider the possibility that the early treatment in the OFH may have contributed (egg transport, sexing, vaccination).</p><p>- In general, this is a commendable paper that should be published after the authors have considered my comments. However, it should also be noted that until in-ovo sexing is a feasible standard method, the differences between the hatchery treatments and the OFH may not be very large from the perspective of animal welfare</p><p>.</p><p>
<bold>Reviewer2</bold>
</p><p>Respected Authors,</p><p>The idea is very well conceptualized, and manuscript is written well, however, at this position I suggest some corrections.</p><p>I have mentioned all my suggestions/corrections in attached file, kindly follow the instructions.</p><p>
<bold>Reviewer3</bold>
</p><p>This is an interesting study that shows that on-farm hatching does not necessarily always result in improved welfare for the laying hens for the rest of their lives. In fact, it seems like traditionally hatched birds that have experienced transport in early life cope better with the move from rearing barn to laying barn. It is nice to see results honestly presented, even though I assume the authors started from the hypothesis that on-farm hatching would be beneficial (given the rest of the literature).</p><p>I don't have any major issues with this paper. The results seem clear, as do the methods. I do have a few requests for clarification, though, and a (very) few editing suggestions.</p><p>1) Could the authors please explain a bit better the implications of the fact that some birds were killed and then replaced by other animals? Does this mean that the sample of OFH and STAN birds at different time points were partially overlapping, but not identical groups of birds? Does that have any implications for the stats?</p><p>2) In the statistics, often different data structures were chosen for different variables. Please explain how you decided on each of these structures and why.</p><p>3) Given the recently presented results on the difference beteen KBF high on the keel (typically on the outside, and from collisions) vs. low on the keel (typically on the inside and due to egg laying), do the authors have any information on whether the difference between OFH birds and STAN birds was mostly due to "collision breaks" or to "egg laying breaks"? The discussion suggests they believe collisions are more to blame due to inexperience with moving around the aviary, but it would be good to see the other discussed.</p><p>4) I don't quite follow the reasoning on line 395 about counterbalancing. The study did not really assess HPA axis activity, so what are the authors trying to explain away here, then?</p><p>5) The authors don't report this, but I wonder if there was any effect of OFH on mortality in the laying barn (and therefore on total egg production, rather than per-bird production).</p><p>a. line 140 "between 2 and 8 o'clock" instead of "2 and 8 hour"? Or do you mean between 2 and 8 hours after lights came on?</p><p>b. line 153: "KBF severity and feather damage" instead of "KBF severity the feather damage"?</p><p>c. line 234: although what you say is not wrong, the fact that red is left of blue in the figure makes it more logical to write "Red and blue colours represent the treatment groups OFH and STAN respectively", as they are then in the same order as in the figure.</p><p>d. line 238: "Model coefficients" instead of "Models' coefficients"</p><p>e. line 239: "To help further interpret" instead of "To help further interpreting"</p><p>f. line 342-343: please clarify the phrase "potential decreased weight gained" - I get confused about what goes up and what goes down.</p><p>Please submit your revised manuscript by 6 Nov 2023.

Montalcini</p><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we have decided that your manuscript needs Major Revision.</p><p>Kind regards,</p><p>Prof. Lamiaa Mostafa Radwan, Ph.D.</p><p>Academic Editor</p><p>PLOS ONE</p><p>Editor Comments:</p><p>1- Material and methods need more details, especially the method used to determine the sex of the newly hatched chicks.</p><p>2- The statistical model used needs to be reviewed and written with more clarification and detail, and all data in the manuscript must be subjected to statistical analysis.</p><p>Reviewer1</p><p>A very interesting paper on an important topic. I would like the authors to attend to the following comments and suggestions:</p><p>- The eggs were transported on day 18 of incubation to the on-farm hatch system. Please consider the possible stress this may have induced on the embryos. Recent research has showed that the embryos may be susceptible to stress at this point and this may have affected your results (Nordquist, R.E., Vernooij, J.C.M., Dull, C.L., Pascual, A., van der Linde, G., Goerlich, V.C., 2022. The effects of transport of 18-day old hatching eggs on physiology and behaviour of slow growing broiler chicken. Applied Animal Behaviour Science 257.)</p><p>- The newly hatched chicks were manually sexed - please provide more information on how this was done and how this may possibly have affected the chicks that remained in the experiment.</p><p>- I think the egg production data should in fact be possible to test in a more rigorous statistical manner. Although I appreciate that there were only five pens per treatment, a statistical evaluation would be helpful in order to validate the findings.</p><p>- The differences between treatment groups in KBF are surprising (to me at least) and I think the authors should consider the possibility that the early treatment in the OFH may have contributed (egg transport, sexing, vaccination).</p><p>- In general, this is a commendable paper that should be published after the authors have considered my comments. However, it should also be noted that until in-ovo sexing is a feasible standard method, the differences between the hatchery treatments and the OFH may not be very large from the perspective of animal welfare</p><p>.</p><p>Reviewer2</p><p>Respected Authors,</p><p>The idea is very well conceptualized, and manuscript is written well, however, at this position I suggest some corrections.</p><p>I have mentioned all my suggestions/corrections in attached file, kindly follow the instructions.</p><p>Reviewer3</p><p>This is an interesting study that shows that on-farm hatching does not necessarily always result in improved welfare for the laying hens for the rest of their lives. In fact, it seems like traditionally hatched birds that have experienced transport in early life cope better with the move from rearing barn to laying barn. It is nice to see results honestly presented, even though I assume the authors started from the hypothesis that on-farm hatching would be beneficial (given the rest of the literature).</p><p>I don't have any major issues with this paper.

</p><p>Dear Prof. Lamiaa Mostafa Radwan and Reviewers,</p><p>Thank you very much for giving us the opportunity to revise our manuscript. We also thank the three reviewers for their kind comments and constructive suggestions. We believe their recommendations have significantly enhanced the statistical analysis, particularly in the production sub-section. It now includes a survival analysis based on the daily mortality and a statistical evaluation of the treatment's effect on egg production data. Thanks to reviewers&#x02019; suggestions, we also clarified different aspects of the Material and Methods, including the study design and the statistical analysis. The discussion now contains more detailed interpretations and further alternatives explanations (including how factors during egg-laying may relate to our results on keel bone fractures). We provide point-by-point responses in an attached word document file, and hope the reviewers&#x02019; concerns have been addressed.</p><p>With best regards,</p><p>Camille Montalcini</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0295560.s009" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0295560.s009.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0295560.r003" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0295560.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Radwan</surname><given-names>Lamiaa Mostafa</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2023 Lamiaa Mostafa Radwan</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2023</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Lamiaa Mostafa Radwan</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0295560" id="rel-obj003" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
