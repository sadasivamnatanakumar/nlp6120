RV cytopathic effect has been shown to be due to caspase-dependent apoptosis in a number of susceptible cell lines, and it has been suggested that this apoptotic induction could be a causal factor in the development of such defects. Often the outcome of apoptotic stimuli is dependent on apoptotic, proliferative and survival signaling mechanisms in the cell. Therefore we investigated the role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt survival signaling and Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK proliferative signaling during RV-induced apoptosis in RK13 cells. Increasing levels of phosphorylated ERK, Akt and GSK3&#x003b2; were detected from 24&#x02013;96 hours post-infection, concomitant with RV-induced apoptotic signals. Inhibition of PI3K-Akt signaling reduced cell viability, and increased the speed and magnitude of RV-induced apoptosis, suggesting that this pathway contributes to cell survival during RV infection. In contrast, inhibition of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway impaired RV replication and growth and reduced RV-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the normal cellular growth is required for efficient virus production.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Rubella virus (RV) is the sole member of the <italic>Rubivirus </italic>genus of the <italic>Togaviridae</italic>. It has a positive-sense single stranded RNA genome that is 9762 nucleotides (nt) in length and contains two non-overlapping open-reading frames (ORFs). The 5' proximal ORF encodes the p200 polyprotein precursor for the nonstructural proteins (NSPs) p150 and p90 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The 3' proximal ORF encodes the structural proteins: capsid (C), and glycoproteins E1 and E2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>RV infection usually causes mild disease with few complications. However, infection during the first trimester of pregnancy results in fetal infection, and in more than 75% of cases this leads to the development of congenital abnormalities. These abnormalities include sensorineural deafness, mental retardation, and congenital heart defects, and are collectively termed congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The cellular mechanisms activated by RV, which lead to the disruption of organogenesis, are not fully understood. However, in permissive cell cultures, the cytopathic effect (CPE) of RV has been shown to be due to caspase-dependent apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Apoptosis is a key component of developmental processes in mammals, which functions to delete vestigial structures, control cell number and remodel tissues and organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Thus, it has been proposed that RV-induced apoptosis may cause irreparable damage to fetal tissues, resulting in the abnormalities observed in CRS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, the outcome of RV infection is likely to depend on multiple signaling events that control the balance between cell death and cell survival.</p><p>Eukaryotic cells contain a large number of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades that are activated in response to growth factors, cytokines and stress stimuli such as viral infection and UV irradiation. In common with apoptotic proteins, MAPKs are highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. These cascades integrate external stimuli and transmit signals to the nucleus resulting in the activation of transcription factors, which regulate expression of genes required for proliferation, differentiation, survival and apoptosis. Two well-studied mitogenic pathways are the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway and the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway, which are central to cell survival and proliferative signals respectively.</p><p>PI3Ks phosphorylate plasma membrane inositol lipids at the 3' position of the inositol ring. These 3'phosphoinsoitides recruit proteins such as Akt and phosphoinositide dependent kinases 1 and 2 (PDK1/2) to the plasma membrane via their pleckstrin homology (PH) domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. At the plasma membrane PDK1/2 activate Akt through phosphorylation at Ser<sup>473 </sup>and Thr<sup>308</sup>. Activated Akt promotes cell survival by phosphorylating and inhibiting a number of pro-apoptotic proteins including BAD, caspase-9, GSK-3&#x003b2; and Forkhead transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>The Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK is a classical MAPK pathway where growth factor-receptor interactions trigger intracellular activation of the small G-protein Ras. Ras recruits and directly activates the MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKK) Raf, which phosphorylates and activates the MAPK kinase (MAPKK) MEK1/2, which in turn activate the MAPK ERK1/2. Activated ERK1/2 translocates to the nucleus where it can activate a number of transcription factors including c-<italic>myc</italic>, c-<italic>jun</italic>, and <italic>Elk-1</italic>, which regulate cell cycle progression responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Activation of PI3K-Akt and Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling cascades during virus infection is thought to play an important role not only in cellular growth and survival, but also in virus replication and growth during both acute and chronic virus infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This study was carried out to examine the role of PI3K-Akt and Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling during RV infection in RK13 cells. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and the MEK inhibitor U0126 were used to investigate PI3K-Akt and Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling respectively during RV replication, growth and induction of apoptosis. Apoptosis was measured in RV-infected cells by caspase activity and cell viability assays, DNA fragmentation analysis, and trypan blue exclusion staining. Involvement of PI3K-Akt and Raf-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling in RV-induced apoptosis was also examined by expression of constitutively active Akt and MEK in RV-infected cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2 and their downstream targets during RV infection</title><p>The effect of RV infection on PI3K-Akt and Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathways was investigated by examining the expression and phosphorylation profiles of Akt, ERK1/2 and their downstream targets.

Phosphorylated Akt and ERK2 (but not ERK1) were detected in the mock-infected cells at 96 hours p.i. but not before, whereas total levels of Akt and ERK 1/2 were detectable at all time points (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Treatment of RV-infected cells with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 completely inhibited activation of Akt and ERK1/2 respectively (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Kinase phosphorylation during RV infection.

(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Phosphorylated Akt and ERK1/2 were detectable in RV-infected cells at 48 and 36 hours p.i. respectively. p70S6K is phosphorylated by FRAP/mTOR downstream of Akt at Thr<sup>389 </sup>and at Thr<sup>421</sup>/Ser<sup>42</sup>, downstream of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. Phosphorylation at Thr<sup>389 </sup>was observed at 12, 24, 60, 84 and 96 hours p.i. (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Phosphorylation of the Thr<sup>421</sup>/Ser<sup>42 </sup>site was observed at all time points, although increases in band intensity could be seen at 12, 24, 60, 84 and 96 hours p.i., mirroring the phosphorylation at Thr<sup>389</sup>.

The XTT assay was used to examine the effect of RV infection and LY29002 and U0126 treatment on cellular metabolism over time. XTT is a tetrazolium salt, which is cleaved by the succinate dehydrogenase system of mitochondria in metabolically active cells, to yield a soluble orange formazan product. A decrease in the intensity of formazan was used to monitor changes in cellular metabolism and cell viability in RV-infected cells by spectroscopy.</p><p>Cellular viability during RV infection did not appear to be disrupted, supporting previous observations which reported that a large number of monolayer cells remain in tact and do not rapidly undergo apoptosis in RV infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). LY294002 treatment of RK13 cells reduced cell viability by 20%, which remained constant throughout the 12&#x02013;96 hour period. Cell viability was reduced to 60% in the presence of both RV and LY294002. Thus the combined effect of PI3K inhibition and RV-infection caused a significant reduction in cell viability.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>The effect of PI3K and MEK1/2 inhibition on cell viability during RV infection.

At indicated time points cell viability was determined by XTT assay. Tetrazolium salt (XTT) and electron coupling reagent were added directly to cells, and after 24 hours the absorbance at 405&#x02013;690 nm was determined.

With the addition of RV, the U0126 curve moved to the right, the effect of the drug was delayed by approximately 12 hours.</p></sec><sec><title>Inhibition of PI3K results in an increase in the speed and magnitude of RV-induced apoptosis</title><p>To evaluate the role of PI3K-dependent signaling during RV infection, the effects of PI3K inhibitor LY294002 on the development of RV-induced apoptosis were examined, 12&#x02013;96 hours p.i., by caspase activity assay, trypan blue exclusion staining, DNA fragmentation and light microscopy. (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;D</xref>). RV-induced apoptotic signaling has been reported to occur between 12&#x02013;24 hours p.i., with peak caspase activity occurring around 72 hours p.i. at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3 PFU/cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> shows that with a MOI of 4 PFU/cell the peak of RV-induced caspase activity occurs earlier at 60 hours p.i. When RV infection was carried out in the presence of LY294002, the maximum caspase activity increased by 53.9 % (P &#x0003c; 0.05) and occurred 12 hours earlier than with RV alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>The effect of PI3K and MEK1/2 inhibition on RV-induced apoptosis.

LY294002 treatment doubles (and at 84 hours p.i. triples) the number of floating cells produced in RV-infected cells. Increases in the number of apoptotic floating cells are statistically significant at 84 and 96 hours p.i. (P &#x0003c; 0.05). Fragmented DNA patterns can be seen at 72 hours p.i. with both RV and RV in the presence of LY294002 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). However, the interesting feature of these apoptotic ladders is that in RV-infected cells, a significant proportion of genomic DNA is still intact, whereas when RV-infected cells are also exposed to LY294002, the majority of the genomic DNA is fragmented. The morphological changes caused by RV-infection and LY294002 were examined by light microscopy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). At 72 hours p.i. CPE and induction of apoptosis by RV can be clearly seen. RV-induced CPE is characterized in the earlier stages by clumps of apoptotic cells, surrounded by healthy cells.

B &#x02013; RK13 cells in 6-well plates were transfected with Akt, MEK or pUSEamp(+) control constructs for 24 hours and subsequently infected with RV or mock-infected. 24 hours later cell lysates were collected and tested for caspase activity using artificial caspase substrate Ac-DEVD-pNA.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1743-422X-2-1-5"/></fig></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We have previously shown that RV induces caspase activation during the early stages of infection <italic>in vitro</italic>, prior to the appearance of morphological apoptotic changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In this study we demonstrated that, in common with other viruses such as Coxsackievirus B3 virus, human cytomegalovirus, influenza virus A, and respiratory syncitial virus (RSV) (Cooray, 2004; Johnson et al., 2001; Opavsky et al., 2001; Pleschka et al., 2001), signaling downstream of PI3K stimulates a survival response in the cell following RV infection and that signaling downstream of MEK1/2 is required for RV replication, growth and induction of apoptosis.</p><p>Analysis of phosphorylation profiles during RV infection demonstrated that the presence of the virus stimulated an increase in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Akt, and Akt target GSK-3&#x003b2; over time. The presence of phosphorylated Akt (and occasionally ERK2) at 96 hours p.i. in the mock-infected cells, suggests that cell survival mechanisms may be activated in older uninfected cell cultures. The phosphorylation pattern of downstream target p70S6K did not follow that of Akt and ERK1/2. Apart from being phosphorylated by ERK1/2 and mTOR/FRAP downstream of Akt, p70S6K can be phosphorylated by an array of different proline-directed kinases, including PDK1, PKC&#x003b6;, JNK and cdc2 which may explain this difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>The phosphorylation of c-<italic>myc</italic>, a downstream target of ERK1/2, did not follow the same pattern. Levels of phosphorylated c-<italic>myc </italic>decreased as infection progressed, which was probably due to its targeted degradation or the action of cellular phosphatases. RV infection has been observed to slow cell cycle progression both <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. As c-<italic>myc </italic>is a transcription factor that stimulates cell cycle progression, its de-phosphorylation or degradation as RV infection progresses supports these observations. The expression and activity of c-<italic>myc </italic>and other downstream transcription factors in relation to the cell cycle during RV-infection requires further investigation. Phosphorylation of BAD, downstream of Akt, could not be detected in RV-infected cells (data not shown). However, BAD is not ubiquitously expressed and therefore may not be produced in the rabbit kidney epithelial cells (RK13) used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Inhibition of PI3K signaling with LY294006 significantly increased the speed and magnitude of RV-induced apoptosis as shown by increased caspase activity, dead floating cells, apoptotic laddering of genomic DNA and decreased cell viability. Thus, RV-induced apoptotic signaling appears to be held in check by host cell survival signals downstream of PI3K. Although inhibition of PI3K did not affect RV replication, virus growth was affected. The speed of apoptotic monolayer death may have prevented production of optimal virus titers.</p><p>The importance of PI3K survival signaling has been observed with other viruses. Recently phosphorylation of Akt, GKS3&#x003b2; and PKC&#x003b6; (another downstream target of PI3K signaling), has been demonstrated in Vero E6 cells early during infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated corona virus (CoV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. However, unlike in this study the survival response due to PI3K-Akt signaling was deemed to be weak, as LY294002 treatment did not result in an increase in apoptotic DNA laddering. PI3K, Akt and NF&#x003ba;B have also been shown to be activated prior to epithelial cell apoptosis in RSV-infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. As with RV, inhibition of PI3K increased the speed and magnitude of RSV-induced apoptosis, although host-cell survival was suggested to occur prior to apoptotic signaling, as opposed to RV where caspase activation and Akt phosphorylation occur concomitantly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. PI3K-Akt signaling has also been shown to reduce coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced apoptosis. However, in contrast to RSV, the replication of CVB3 was also reduced, suggesting that PI3K-Akt survival signals may also serve as a defense mechanism against virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>Inhibition of the MEK1/2 in RK13 cells by U0126 resulted in necrotic monolayer destruction and a significant decrease in cell viability. XTT assay and light microscopy demonstrated that RV infection appeared to delay the effect of U0126. As discussed above, RV infection stimulates ERK activity, downstream of MEK, and may therefore counteract the effect of the inhibitor. Despite this, U0126 impaired RV replication, growth, and induction of apoptosis. Therefore it appears that although RV infection slows the cell cycle progression, cells must be cycling and metabolizing normally for RV replication to occur.</p><p>ERK1/2 phosphorylation has also been observed during infection with a number of other viruses, and inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling by U0126 has consistently been shown to be detrimental to virus growth. Infection of Jurkat cells with CVB3, for example, leads to up-regulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and elevated levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 have been observed in the myocardium of mice susceptible to CVB3-induced myocarditis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Treatment of cultured cells with U0126 reduced CVB3 titers and inhibited the release of virus progeny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Similarly, HCMV infection in human embryonic lung fibroblasts (HELs) has been shown to stimulate biphasic activation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, and treatment of infected cells with U0126 reduced viral DNA replication, protein production and virus titer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Influenza A virus infection <italic>in vitro </italic>has also been shown to stimulate biphasic activation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2, and U0126 treatment prevented export of ribonucleoprotein complexes from the nucleus and inhibited virus production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Inhibition of MEK1/2 during HIV infection has been demonstrated to reduce infectivity, but unlike the other viruses mentioned herein, did not affect protein levels or virus production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. These findings, along with the results of this study, suggest that signaling downstream of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 is important for viral infectivity and efficient virus replication and growth <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Over-expression of Akt and MEK1/2 increased RV-induced caspase activity in RK13 cells. This response was not due to the transfection procedure, as the increase in caspase activity was not observed in the pUSEamp(+) or lipofectamine controls. Such a response is also seen in malignant cells, which are more readily killed by apoptotic stimuli. Thus, the over-expression of these mitogenic pathways may have resulted in a cell survival response whereby a negative feedback loop occurred that sensitized cells to RV-induced apoptosis. In order to study this further, it would be necessary to construct stable cell lines over-expressing active Akt and ERK1/2 as well as their dominant negative mutants and other signaling proteins.</p><p>It is clear from the results of this and previous studies that the outcome of RV infection <italic>in vitro </italic>depends on numerous signaling events. It has been suggested that RV capsid protein, when anchored to the ER can independently induce apoptosis in culture (Duncan et. al, 2000). However this has not been confirmed by other groups and there is conflicting evidence that virus replication and the presence of the RV NSPs (which are necessary for replication) is required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Interestingly the NSP p90 has been shown to interact with the retinoblastoma (pRB) cell cycle-regulatory protein and the cytokinesis regulatory protein citron-K kinase (CK), and it has been suggested that this may perturb the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. How these interactions interfere with signaling pathways and modulate cellular responses, however, remains to be determined.</p><p>In relation to CRS, study of the expression and localization of apoptotic and mitogen activated signaling proteins in RV-infected fetal tissues would be necessary to confirm the theory that the pathogenesis of the disease is related to perturbation of the cell cycle. However as CRS is now rare in the UK and work with fetal tissues is tightly regulated, such a study would be hard to carry out. <italic>In vivo </italic>studies are difficult, as a reliable animal model does not exist for CRS. However, it may be possible to extrapolate findings from cell culture systems. We used RK13 cells because they are the best cells in which to detect rubella-induced apoptosis; further studies are required to confirm our findings in primary human embryonic cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Chemical Compounds</title><p>Stock concentrations of PI3K inhibitor LY294002 [2-(4-Morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-1-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one] and MAPK/MEK inhibitor U0126 [1, 4-Diamino-2, 3-dicyano-1, 4-bis (2-aminophenylthio) butadiene] (Calbiochem, UK) were made up in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).
