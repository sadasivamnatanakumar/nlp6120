The enzyme, which catalyzes recombination between 34 nucleotide LoxP sequences during P1 genome replication, has been used in a variety of genetic applications to regulate gene structure and function. These include conditional mutagenesis, gene replacement, chromosome engineering, and regulated gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, the use of site-specific recombination in genetic studies is frequently hampered by difficulties expressing the recombinase in cells at the desired time and place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Moreover, the use of Cre expression vectors is constrained by the fact that prolonged exposure to the enzyme can be lethal to cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>To address these problems, we [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] have developed membrane-permeable Cre recombinase proteins that are capable of entering cells by a process of protein transduction. Protein transduction exploits properties of specific protein sequences [termed protein transduction domains (PTDs)] that enhance the delivery of macromolecules &#x02013; including peptides, proteins, and DNA fragments &#x02013; into living cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Cell-permeant Cre proteins provide an effective means to regulate gene structure and function in living cells, and Cre-mediated recombination provides a potentially useful reporter system with which to study the process of protein transduction itself. In particular, recombination provides a stable and quantitative record of protein uptake that circumvents problems of distinguishing between internalized and cell-associated proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>In our previous report, recombinant fusion proteins bearing the 12 amino acid membrane translocation sequence (MTS) from fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF-4) were used to deliver enzymatically active Cre proteins directly into mammalian cells. Of the four recombinant proteins tested, an enzyme containing an N-terminal 6xHis affinity tag, a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) from SV40 large T antigen, and the FGF-4 MTS (HNCM), displayed the best combination of yield, solubility, nuclear localization and enzymatic activity within cells. Recombination was observed in greater than 70% of cells treated with 10 &#x003bc;M HNCM for 2 hours. Widespread recombination was also observed in mice following intraperitoneal administration of HNCM, indicating that a wide variety of terminally differentiated cell types can internalize cell-permeant Cre and are competent to undergo site-specific recombination.</p><p>In the present study, eleven recombinant Cre proteins were prepared in order to evaluate sequences affecting the uptake and/or activity of the enzyme in cultured cells and if possible to develop more active recombinases. Several constructs were designed to compare the activities of different PTDs, including the FGF-4 MTS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], sequences from HIV TAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and a (KFF)<sub>3</sub>K sequence that was previously used to deliver peptide nucleic acid (PNA) conjugates into cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Only the Tat sequence promoted the delivery of active Cre into cells, while all three PTD sequences adversely affected the solubility of recombinant proteins containing polyhistidine tags. The contribution of the SV40 large T antigen NLS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] was also examined to understand apparent differences in the behaviour of cell-permeant Cre and proteins expressed following gene transfer. Thus, the activity of cell-permeant Cre was enhanced by the SV40 large T antigen NLS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], whereas, the native Cre protein appears to possesses a functional NLS, whose activity was not augmented by the T antigen NLS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We report that polyhistidine tags (6xHis) frequently used for protein affinity purification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and the large T antigen NLS each separately enhance cellular uptake of enzymatically active Cre, and we describe the development of a cell-permeant Cre recombinase with an excellent combination of activity, solubility and ease of purification.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Recombinant Cre fusion proteins</title><p>Eleven recombinant Cre proteins were prepared in order to evaluate sequences affecting the uptake and/or activity of cell-permeant enzymes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Native Cre (Cre) corresponds to the protein encoded by the P1 phage genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. HC and H<sub>6</sub>C have amino-terminal hexahistidine tags consisting of MGSSHHHHHHSSLVPRGSH and MHHHHHH, respectively, while CH<sub>6 </sub>is similar to H<sub>6</sub>C except the His tag is on the C-terminus. His-NLS-Cre (HNC) is similar to HC except a nuclear localization sequence (PKKKRKV) from SV40 large T antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] is positioned between His and Cre. HT<sub>7</sub>N'C is similar to HNC except the His tag contains 11 additional amino acids (MASMTGGQQMG) from the pET28a(+) polylinker and the arginine of the NLS sequence was converted to a lysine. This change, which resulted from an altered PCR primer, is unlikely to affect nuclear localization activity. HNCM, described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], contains a membrane translocation sequence (MTS) from the leader sequence of FGF-4 positioned at the C-terminus of HNC. Finally, four different sequences, each reported to have protein transduction activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], were placed on the amino terminus of CH<sub>6</sub>. These consisted of the FGF-4 MTS (MCH<sub>6</sub>), an SV40 large T antigen nuclear localization sequence (NCH<sub>6</sub>), the HIV Tat sequence (TCH<sub>6</sub>), and a (KFF)<sub>3</sub>K sequence (KCH<sub>6</sub>).</p><p>Cre proteins were expressed from pET28a(+) plasmids in <italic>E. coli </italic>and, except for native Cre, were purified by Ni<sup>2+ </sup>affinity chromatography under non-denaturing conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The native enzyme was purified by a combination of hydroxyapatite column chromatography and Sephacryl S-100 HR FPLC. All proteins were expressed at high levels, with yields of purified proteins ranging from 5 to 41 mg/L of <italic>E. coli </italic>culture (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). All of the enzymes except TCH<sub>6 </sub>and KCH<sub>6 </sub>could be dialyzed against DMEM or RPMI media and stored at -20&#x000b0;C until use. However, TCH<sub>6 </sub>precipitated under these conditions and was dialyzed instead against PBS supplemented with 0.3 M NaCl (0.45 M total NaCl) and 8% glycerol. The pH of the buffer (ranging from 7.5&#x02013;8.5) had no obvious effect on protein solubility. The KCH<sub>6 </sub>protein was insoluble over a range of pH values and salt concentrations (up to 0.8 M), and the protein was not evaluated further. The remaining proteins could be prepared at final concentrations above 1 mg/ml except HNCM, which precipitated out of solution at protein concentrations above 500 &#x003bc;g/ml. The specific activities of the tagged fusion proteins were similar, ranging from 4.3&#x02013;8.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>U/mg protein, corresponding to 47&#x02013;92% of the activity of the native enzyme (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Native Cre recombinase has protein transduction activity that is enhanced by polyhistidine and NLS sequences</title><p>The uptake and enzymatic activity of Cre proteins was monitored in Tex.loxP.EG cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. These cells contain a single integrated retrovirus (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) in which the expression of an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene is prevented by a "stop cassette" consisting of multiple polyadenylation sites positioned between two loxP sites. Deletion of the stop cassette by Cre mediated-recombination activates the expression of the EGFP reporter gene. Cells were exposed to Cre, HC, HNC, HT<sub>7</sub>N'C, HNCM, H<sub>6</sub>C, CH<sub>6</sub>, NCH<sub>6</sub>, and TCH<sub>6 </sub>for 2 hrs at concentrations ranging from 0 to 8 &#x003bc;M. The cells were then washed extensively with PBS, were cultured for 24 hrs to provide time for EGFP expression, and the percentage of EGFP-expressing cells was determined by flow cytometry. Recombination was also monitored by Southern blot hybridization (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), thus confirming that expression of the EGFP reporter accurately reflected the extent of template recombination.</p><p>As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, all of the proteins tested induced recombination in a concentration-dependent manner. The native enzyme had the lowest activity, inducing recombination in up to 17% of the cells. Uptake and/or activity was increased by polyhistidine tags positioned on either the amino- (HC and H<sub>6</sub>C) or carboxy-terminal (CH<sub>6</sub>) ends of the enzyme. HC, which contains the 6xHis tag from pET28a(+), and H<sub>6</sub>C and CH<sub>6</sub>, which contain simple 6xHis sequences, induced similar levels of recombination, ranging between 45 and 60% of cells. Activity was further increased by the addition of an SV40 large T antigen nuclear localization signal (HNC, HT<sub>7</sub>N'C and NCH). At low concentrations, TCH<sub>6 </sub>was the most active protein tested, but higher levels of the protein were toxic to cells, presumably because of the concentration of NaCl required to maintain protein solubility during preparation of the enzyme. Finally, presence of the FGF-4 MTS sequence proved inhibitory for recombination in cultured cells. HNC, which lacks the MTS sequence, was approximately 8 times more active than HNCM as determined by the concentration of enzyme required to induce recombination in 50% of the cells. Thus, while the FGF-4 MTS has been used to transduce a variety of proteins and peptides into mammalian cells, the sequence suppressed the activity of cell-permeant Cre. This confirms the results of a earlier study, reported while this work was in progress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Temperature-dependent protein transduction</title><p>Transduction of cargoes containing the FGF-4 MTS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], including the HNCM protein used in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], is greatly decreased at 4&#x000b0;C as compared to 37&#x000b0;C. By contrast, there have been conflicting reports with regard to the transduction of proteins containing the Tat and Antennapedia PTDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Cre fusion proteins with (HNCM) and without (HNC, HT<sub>7</sub>N'C and HC) the FGF-4 MTS were therefore tested for their ability to enter cells at 4&#x000b0;C (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Tex.loxP.EG cells were incubated with varying concentrations of the proteins for one hour at either 37&#x000b0;C or 4&#x000b0;C; were washed extensively and were cultured at 37&#x000b0;C to allow time for EGFP expression. In each case, the uptake of the enzyme was inhibited at 4&#x000b0;C, indicating that the inhibitory effects of low temperature are not limited to cargoes containing the FGF-4 MTS. Low levels of recombination observed in cells treated with higher concentrations probably results from cell-associated enzyme that the washing steps fail to remove and that gains entry when cells are later cultured at 37&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Serum and cell density effects on protein transduction</title><p>Serum has been reported to inhibit the transduction of cargoes containing the FGF-4 MTS; whereas, transduction of proteins containing the Tat and Antennapedia PTDs appears to be unaffected by serum. The effects of serum on protein transduction were assessed by treating TexloxP.EG cells with either HC (5 &#x003bc;M) or HNC (2 &#x003bc;M) for 1 hour in the presence of varying concentrations of either fetal bovine serum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, FBS) or normal mouse serum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, MS). Recombination induced by both proteins was inhibited by up to 60% and 80% in media containing 10% FBS and MS, respectively. Serum appeared to inhibit protein transduction specifically, since it had no discernable effect on either the stability or activity of the proteins <italic>in vitro </italic>(data not shown). These results indicate that the inhibition of protein transduction by serum is not limited to cargoes containing the FGF-4 MTS.</p><p>To assess the effects of cell density on protein transduction, TexloxP.EG cells were seeded at different concentrations in 2 cm<sup>2 </sup>culture dishes and were treated with HNC (2 &#x003bc;M) for 1 hour (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Recombination efficiencies increased by about 40% as the number of number of cells was increased from 10<sup>4 </sup>to 6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>cells/cm<sup>2</sup>, and then declined sharply at concentrations above 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. Tex.loxP.EG is a T-cell line and is non-adherent; however, the cells settle to the bottom of the culture dish. The optimum density for recombination was similar to the number of cells (.75 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>cells/cm<sup>2</sup>) required to cover the culture dish.</p></sec><sec><title>Uptake and localization of cell-permeant Cre proteins</title><p>The kinetics of cell-permeant Cre uptake in cultured cells was monitored by examining cells for recombination after exposure to cell-permeant Cre for different lengths of time (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Cells were treated with HC (5 &#x003bc;M), HNC (3 &#x003bc;M) and HNCM (10 &#x003bc;M) for 5 to 120 mins, were washed extensively and the extent of recombination was monitored 24 hours later by flow cytometry. Thus, the assay measures the time required for extracellular enzyme to become committed to cell entry. The uptake of HC, HNC and HNCM increased with time, reaching half-maximum levels after 15&#x02013;20 min. Recombination was induced in cells following exposure to HNC and HNCM proteins for less time than to HC, suggesting a direct role for the NLS in promoting cell binding and/or entry. Note that the observed differences (apparent within minutes after exposing cells to Cre) cannot reflect potential differences in nuclear trafficking since a delay in nuclear import of a few minutes would not affect the extent of recombination measured 24 hours later.</p><p>The uptake and localization of cell-permeant Cre in cultured cells was also monitored in living cells by using proteins labeled with the fluorescent dye, Alexa 488 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The uptake of tagged HC, HNC and HNCM increased with the time as measured by flow cytometry (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Again, HNC and HNCM appeared to enter cells more rapidly than HC, which lacks an NLS. Note that the magnitude of the fluorescence is less important than the rate of increase (slope) since the proteins were not labelled to the same extent with Alexa 488.</p><p>The localization of Alexa 488-tagged HNC and HC proteins was monitored in living cells by fluorescence microscopy. The HNC protein was localized to the nuclei of Cos7 cells, but was predominately cytoplasmic in NIH3T3 cells (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Cre protein was also localized to the nuclei of Tex.loxP.EGcells (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Recombination in different cell types</title><p>Several mammalian cell types were analyzed for their ability to undergo Cre-mediated recombination. Clones of Cos7 and NIH3T3 cells containing a single pBABE.lox.stp.EGFP provirus were treated with HNC for two hour and analyzed by Southern blot hybridization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Although the concentration of enzyme necessary to achieve nearly complete recombination was approximately 10 times higher in Cos7 cells than in NIH3T3 cells (10 versus 1 &#x003bc;M, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), the recombination efficiency did not correlate with localization of the enzyme to the nucleus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Extensive recombination was also observed in murine embryonic stem cells containing a floxed IKK &#x003b3; gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) and in primary splenocytes explanted from ROSA26R mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Efficient recombination was therefore observed in all mammalian cell types examined.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Cell permeant Cre proteins have generated considerable interest as genetic tools to regulate gene structure and function in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In addition, Cre mediated recombination provides a quantitative reporter for studies on the protein transduction process itself. In the present study, 11 recombinant fusion proteins were analyzed to characterize sequences and conditions that affect protein uptake and/or activity and to develop more active cell-permeant enzymes. We report that the native enzyme has a low, but intrinsic ability to enter cells. Uptake and was enhanced by the addition of a 6xhistidine-tag on either the amino or carboxyl terminal ends of the protein and was enhanced further by the addition of a nuclear localization sequence from SV40 large T antigen or the transduction sequence from the HIV Tat protein. Finally, the hydrophobic membrane translocation sequence (MTS) from fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF-4) had a net deleterious effect on Cre-mediated recombination in cultured cells.</p><p>We had hoped that the native or 6xHis-tagged enzymes would lack transduction activity so that the effects of additional sequences on cell entry, nuclear transport and recombination could be compared. However, we found that the native Cre protein has an intrinsic ability to enter cells, thus confirming observations by Will, et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The mechanism by which Cre gains entry into cells remains to be determined. The enzyme may possess a protein transduction domain analogous to those described for HIV Tat, Antennapedia and a growing list of proteins that can enter cells directly, without requiring specific receptor and transporter systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The fact that Cre is a basic protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] is potentially significant considering that many basic peptides are capable of entering cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>The transduction activity of the native enzyme hinders quantitative studies of sequences incorporated into recombinant Cre proteins, since structural changes associated with each modification may have varying effects on the intrinsic ability of Cre to enter cells. Even so, the 6xHis sequence appeared to facilitate cell entry, since two different 6xHis sequences enhanced Cre-mediated recombination while having little effect on the activity of the enzyme <italic>in vitro</italic>. Moreover, 6xHis sequences were active when positioned on either the amino- or carboxyl-terminal ends of the enzyme. L-histidine heptamers have been shown to enter cells, although much less efficiently than arginine homopolymers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Positively charged histidine sequences also bind cell surface heparin sulfate proteoglycans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], and thus may enhance uptake as has been suggested for the HIV Tat transduction sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The transduction activity of the 6xHis sequences is potentially significant given their widespread use as affinity tags to purify recombinant fusion proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>We [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] have shown that the activity of cell-permeant Cre fusion proteins in cultured cells can be enhanced by the addition of an SV40 large T antigen nuclear localization sequence (NLS). The NLS has been shown to enhance the activity of Cre expression vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], presumably by targeting the protein to the nucleus. However, in the present study the NLS enhanced the delivery of Cre fusion proteins into cultured cells as assessed either by cell-based recombination or by uptake of fluorescent Cre proteins. Moreover, nuclear localization did not appear to contribute to cell type-specific differences in the activity of the HNC protein. These results are consistent with the observation that the T antigen NLS, like a number of other basic sequences, has protein transduction activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>HNC, which consisted of a 6xHis tag and T antigen NLS attached to the amino-terminus of the enzyme, was highly active despite the absence of a canonical protein transduction sequence. The 6xHis tag and NLS sequences separately contributed to the transduction of the enzyme, which was 5&#x02013;8 times more active in cultured cells than the HisNLSCreMTS (HNCM) protein described in our earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. By virtue of their positive charge, these elements share similarities with basic protein transduction domains such as HIV Tat and Antennapedia. Early studies suggested that the basic PTDs entered cells through an energy-independent process that was relatively unaffected by low (4&#x000b0;C) temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. However, later studies suggest that the positively charged PTDs promote cell uptake by endocytosis possibly by binding negatively charged proteins on the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Similarly, the uptake of Cre fusion proteins is consistent with an endocytic mechanism. In particular, uptake (time required for commitment to entry) was relatively rapid (10 to 15 min for half maximum uptake), was greatly decreased at 4&#x000b0;C, and was inhibited by up to 80% by serum. The inhibition by serum appeared to involve cell binding and/or entry specifically, since serum had no discernable effect on the stability or activity of Cre fusion proteins <italic>in vitro </italic>(data not shown). Recombination was markedly suppressed at higher cell densities, possibility because binding sites in or on cells sequester the enzyme, thus lowering the effective protein concentration. Alternatively, cell density may suppress protein transduction by reducing cell size and/or available surface area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In either event, similar observations have been reported for a TatCre protein that lacks a 6xHis tag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], illustrating the need to control for cell density when comparing the effects or cell-permeant proteins in different cell populations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The effects of different sequences on Cre uptake or activity were difficult to predict in advance, and consequently, the process of developing a more active cell-permeant recombinase was largely empirical. Proteins containing amino-terminal Tat and (KFF)<sub>3</sub>K sequences (TCH<sub>6 </sub>and KCH<sub>6</sub>) were poorly soluble when dialyzed against isotonic media, and the FGF-4 MTS interfered with the activity of the enzyme in cultured cells. Since Cre is probably not unique in this regard, investigators seeking to develop other cell-permeant proteins would be advised to test a variety of sequences positioned at different places on the protein. In the present case, the HNC protein possesses an outstanding combination of activity, solubility and yield that will enhance the use of cell-permeant Cre to regulate gene structure and function in living cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cre expression vectors</title><p>Native Cre and Cre fusion proteins were expressed in <italic>E. coli </italic>from pET28a (+)-based plasmids (Novagen).
