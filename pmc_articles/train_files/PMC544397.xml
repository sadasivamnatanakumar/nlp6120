Steroids, however, may modulate the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. Dexamethasone (DXM), a synthetic glucocorticoid, is commonly used to reduce inflammation and pain associated with glioblastoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. However, DXM has been reported to make human glioblastoma cells resistant to ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic agents that otherwise cause DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Execution of cells by apoptosis usually requires the activation of cysteine proteases such as calpains and caspases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Diverse stimuli may cause an increase in intracellular free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], which is absolutely required for activation of calpain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Activation of caspases may occur via different mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Mitochondria mediated pathway of apoptosis may be activated in course of cell death. This involves the regulation of apoptosis by the Bcl-2 family proteins via controlling the release of cytochrome <italic>c </italic>from mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and subsequent formation of the cytosolic 'apoptosome' complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], which ultimately activates caspase-3 for execution of cells. Thus, the members of the Bcl-2 family modulate the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The pro-apoptotic (e.g., Bax, Bcl-xS) and anti-apoptotic (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-xL) members of this family, respectively, promote and inhibit the translocation of cytochrome <italic>c </italic>from mitochondria to cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Glucocorticoids are steroid hormones, which are secreted in response to stress and can modulate the ability of cells to undergo apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. For example, glucocorticoids induce apoptosis in thymocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and also increase the sensitivity of hippocampal neurons to cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In contrast, DXM has been reported to induce resistance to certain drugs in glioblastoma cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Although an association with p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1 </sup>protein accumulation has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], the exact mechanism of DXM mediated protection of glioblastoma cells from apoptosis is still largely unclarified. Exposure of human astrocytoma D384 and rat glioblastoma C6 cells to staurosporine induced apoptosis but pretreatment of those cells with DXM caused reduction in staurosporine mediated apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In addition, DXM also conferred protection against the induction of apoptosis by anti-cancer agents including camtothecin and etoposide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. It has also been shown that exposure of glioblastoma cells to glucocorticoids induces partial resistance to anti-cancer agents such as cisplatinum, methotrexate, vincristine, cytarabine, adriamycin, and teniposide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. DXM appears to interfere with p53-dependent pathways of drug toxicity since the glioblastoma cell lines (LN-229 and U87MG) with wild-type p53 status were protected from drug toxicity by DXM to a greater extent than the cell lines (LN-18, LN-308, and T98G) with mutant p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It has been reported earlier that DXM mediated protection from cancer chemotherapy occurs via a p53-independent pathway of regulating p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1 </sup>expression in glioblastoma cells but this effect appears to be cell-type specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Thus, there remains a concern of modulatory effects of DXM on the mechanism of action of any chemotherapeutic agent for treatment of glioblastoma. Therefore, we have initiated this investigation to examine the modulatory effect of DXM on temozolomide (TMZ) induced apoptosis of glioblastoma cells. In an in vitro model using the human glioblastoma U87MG cells, we have investigated whether DXM confers resistance to TMZ action via inhibition of apoptosis.</p><p>TMZ is an alkylating chemotherapeutic drug that readily crosses the blood-brain-barrier in glioblastoma patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It is chemically related to decarbazine and is the 3-methyl derivative of the experimental anti-cancer drug mitozolomide. It has shown anti-tumor activity and relatively low toxicity in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials in patients with various advanced cancers, including malignant glioblastomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. TMZ is spontaneously hydrolyzed under physiological conditions to its active metabolite 5-(3-methyltriazen-1-yl) imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The mechanism of action of MTIC is proposed to be methylation of DNA at the O<sub>6 </sub>position of guanine, with an additional methylation at its N<sub>7 </sub>position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, O<sub>6</sub>-methylguanine (O<sub>6</sub>-meG) may be removed by O<sub>6</sub>-methylguanine methyl transferase (MGMT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Cells deficient in MGMT do not repair O<sub>6</sub>-meG. Replication of DNA introduces a T instead of C opposite to O<sub>6</sub>-meG, resulting in GT mismatches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Activation of mismatch repair system (MMRS) may remove T during DNA repair synthesis. However, ineffective MMRS causes growth arrest and eventually apoptotic death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. These studies have helped define the action of TMZ in cancer cells of mostly hemopoietic origin. However, the action of TMZ in glioblastoma cells remains largely undefined. Glioblastomas are relatively resistant to anti-cancer agents that cause apoptosis via DNA alkylation. Therefore, we have investigated the mechanism of TMZ induced apoptosis in human glioblastoma U87MG cells.</p><p>We found that TMZ caused apoptosis in U87MG cells as detected by morphological and biochemical assays. Alterations in the levels of pro-apoptotic Bax and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins are known to regulate the commitment to apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Therefore, we investigated the levels of these apoptosis regulatory proteins following treatment of U87MG cells with TMZ. The initiation of apoptosis in U87MG cells following exposure to TMZ requires activation of calpain, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent cysteine protease, which plays a role in the mechanism of cell death in human malignant brain tumors including glioblastoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Besides, caspase-3 activity was also increased in TMZ induced apoptosis in U87MG cells. Pretreatment of U87MG cells with DXM blocked TMZ induced apoptosis, indicating that DXM worked as an antagonistic agent in TMZ induced apoptosis in human glioblastoma cells. The knowledge gained from our investigation implies that the combination of DXM and TMZ for the treatment of human glioblastoma patient may result in an undesirable clinical outcome. Preliminary results of this investigation have previously been presented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Evaluation of viability and apoptotic death both morphologically and biochemically</title><p>Exclusion of trypan blue dye by viable U87MG cells was evaluated under a light microscope using a hemocytometer after all treatments.

Treatment of U87MG cells with TMZ induced apoptosis (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) to a significant extent by increasing intracellular free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), interfering with the expression of apoptosis regulatory proteins of the Bcl-2 family resulting in upregulation of Bax:Bcl-2 ratio (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), and increasing the activities of calpain and caspase-3 (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). But a pretreatment of the cells with DXM prevented all these pro-apoptotic mechanisms (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Our data also suggested that pretreatment with DXM can play a critical role in inhibiting Ca<sup>2+ </sup>influx into the cells due to treatment with TMZ, and thus preventing the progression of apoptotic process.</p><p>Several in vitro studies documented a role for calpain in apoptosis of neuronal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] as well as non-neuronal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. However, the mechanisms of calpain mediated cell death are not yet fully understood. Pro-apoptotic Bax is translocated to mitochondria and has shown to be activated by calpain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Increased expression of calpain concurs with elevated expression of Bax relative to Bcl-2, suggesting that calpain overexpression plays an important role during cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Because changes in expression of pro-apoptotic Bax and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 control the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], we examined the levels of expression of Bax and Bcl-2 proteins in U87MG cells following treatment with TMZ (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><p>Our findings support a relationship between an increase in intracellular free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and cell death with an elevation of calpain activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) following exposure of U87MG cells to TMZ. Pretreatment of cells with DXM showed a significant decrease in both intracellular free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] and calpain activity in a subsequent exposure to TMZ. Increased intracellular free [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] causes activation of calpain and degradation of cytoskeletal proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] with destabilization of the cellular integrity leading to cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Our results indicate that DXM plays an important role in the prevention of calpain activation following treatment of glioblastoma cells with TMZ. DXM has been shown to inhibit apoptosis by induction of transcriptional expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Upregulation of Bcl-2 either directly or indirectly can repress the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>flux across the membrane of endoplasmic reticulum, thereby abrogating apoptosis via Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>Treatment of U87MG cells with TMZ caused increase in calpain and caspase-3 activities as evidenced from the cleavage of &#x003b1;-spectrin at specific sites generating 145 kD SBDP and 120 kD SBDP, respectively (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). A pretreatment with DXM decreased calpain and caspase-3 activities in U87MG cells. Overall, the results from this investigation showed that DXM pretreatment interfered with proteolytic activities and apoptotic death in U87MG cells exposed to TMZ. A previous report from our laboratory indicated that corticosteroids could inhibit the proteolytic activity of calpain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>Our study suggests that pretreatment of glioblastoma with DXM should be avoided if there is a plan to treat the glioblastoma patients subsequently with TMZ. Some recurrent glioblastomas remain resistant to almost all current therapeutic endeavors, with low response rates and survival rarely exceeding six months. As there are no clearly established chemotherapeutic regimens for drug resistant glioblastomas, obviously the only aim of therapy is palliation with improvement in the quality of life. In such cases, use of DXM or other glucocorticoids may not be controversial. However, promising therapeutic activity of TMZ against newly diagnosed anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas warrants continued evaluation of this agent in combination settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Delaying disease progression by treatment with TMZ is beneficial to the patients with recurrent glioblastomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Therefore, the use of this drug should be explored further in an adjuvant setting and in combination with other agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>We showed that a pretreatment of human glioblastoma U87MG cells with a low dose of DXM abolished the chemotherapeutic action of TMZ (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), raising a renewed concern about the validity of DXM as a supportive therapy in the treatment of glioblastomas. We acknowledge that pharmacological studies with a glioblastoma cell line may not always yield results that are easily transferred to the in vivo situation for cancer therapy. Also, clinical recommendations should not be based on in vitro data alone. Nevertheless, our data strongly suggested that DXM treatment could well interfere with therapeutic efficacy of chemotherapy in human glioblastoma patients. In fact, this hypothesis is in line with the results from a 1983 clinical trial where the combination of bis(chloroethyl) nitrosourea (BCNU) plus high dose methylprednisolone, a steroid, tended to be less effective than BCNU alone in patients with poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>The data reported here and the previous reports by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], taken together, provide enough reason to call for steroid withdrawal during investigative clinical trials of chemotherapeutic agents in glioblastoma patients. This should be a serious concern at the initial clinical situation when glioblastoma patients are enrolled. In the case of tumor progression during chemotherapy, steroids may still be life-saving agents, and individual decisions concerning a continuation of chemotherapy with concurrent steroid treatment must be made. We also suggest limiting steroid treatment in glioblastoma patients who are receiving chemotherapy outside a controlled clinical trial, because the benefit of chemotherapy for glioblastoma patients is still with limited efficacy and should not be further compromised by co-medication with steroid. Further investigations in xenografted and allografted animal models of glioblastoma as well as in human glioblastoma patients may shed new light in the controversial use of DXM in palliation of human glioblastoma patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and treatments</title><p>Human glioblastoma U87MG cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).

Cells were resuspended in a homogenizing buffer composed of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM PMSF (Bethesda Research Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD), and 5 mM EGTA (Sigma). A polypropylene pestle (Kontes Glass, Vineland, NJ) was placed inside the microcentrifuge tube (1.5 ml) containing cells and the tube was placed inside an ice bucket for 2 min to let the pestle cool to 4&#x000b0;C. Cells were completely homogenized for 30 sec (the homogenization was performed while holding the microcentrifuge tube in ice with one hand). Following homogenization, protein concentration was determined using Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and spectrophotometric measurement at 595 nm (Spectronic, Rochester, NY). Samples were then diluted (1:1) in sample buffer (62.5 mM, Tris pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) and boiled for 5 min. Samples were then loaded onto the 4&#x02013;20% gradient gels for electrophoresis at 200 V for 30 min (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). For detection of &#x003b1;-spectrin bands, a 5% gel was used for electrophoresis at 100 V for 2 h. Following electrophoresis, gels with the resolved proteins were electroblotted to nylon membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) in an electroblotting Genie apparatus (Idea Scientific, Minneapolis, MN). The membranes were blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (5% powdered non-fat milk, 20 mM Tris pH 7.6, 0.1% Tween 20 in saline). Primary antibody was diluted (1:100 for Bax, Bcl-2, caspase-3, and 1:500 for calpain, 1:2,000 for &#x003b1;-spectrin, and 1:15,000 for &#x003b2;-actin) in blocking solution and then added to the blots for 1 h.
