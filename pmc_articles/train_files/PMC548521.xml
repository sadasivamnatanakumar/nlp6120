In humans, passive immunotherapy may require the use of humanized or human antibodies to prevent adverse immune responses against murine epitopes. Therefore we generated human single chain and diabody antibody derivatives based on the binding characteristics of the murine monoclonal antibody Guy's 13. The murine form of this antibody has been used successfully to prevent <italic>Streptococcus mutans </italic>colonization and the development of dental caries in non-human primates, and to prevent bacterial colonization in human clinical trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The antibody derivatives were generated using a chain-shuffling approach based on human antibody variable gene phage-display libraries.

The human antibody fragments bind the antigen as well as the causative agent of dental caries. In addition the human diabody derivative is capable of aggregating <italic>S. mutans in vitro</italic>, making it a useful candidate passive immunotherapeutic agent for oral diseases.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Dental caries is one of the most common infectious diseases of humans. The main causative agent is a group of streptococcal species collectively described as the mutans streptococci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. <italic>Streptococcus mutans </italic>has been identified as the major etiological agent of the disease. Unlike many other diseases, dental caries is as prevalent in the West as it is in developing countries, and therefore attracts significant interest from medical and dental authorities as well as pharmaceutical companies. The first step in the initiation of infection is the attachment of the bacterium to a specific receptor, and this is an ideal point for intervention. Two groups of proteins from mutans streptococci represent primary candidates for a human caries vaccine: i) glucosyltransferase enzymes, which synthesize adhesive glycans and allow microbial accumulation, and ii) cell surface fibrillar proteins that mediate adherence to the salivary pellicle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The bacterial adhesin SAI/II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], a surface-displayed protein with a molecular mass of 190 kDa, plays an important role in the initial attachment of <italic>S. mutans </italic>to the tooth surface. Antibodies recognizing this protein prevent colonization of the buccal cavity by the bacterium and could be developed as a vaccine against dental caries. The most suitable vaccination strategy would be passive immunization, in which monoclonal antibodies or fragments thereof are applied to the tooth surface e.g. using toothpaste, mouthwash or chewing gum. This would make active immunization with the <italic>S. mutans </italic>adhesin unnecessary.</p><p>The murine monoclonal antibody Guy's 13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] which specifically recognizes the SAI/II protein of <italic>S. mutans </italic>and <italic>Streptococcus sobrinus </italic>has been used successfully to prevent <italic>S. mutans </italic>colonization and the development of dental caries in non-human primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The antibody also prevented bacterial colonization in human clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, like other murine antibodies, a major limitation in clinical applications may be the human anti-mouse antibody response (HAMA), which can increase the rate of clearance and initiate allergic reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The problems associated with murine antibodies can be overcome by replacing murine sequences with their human counterparts, e.g. by chimerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], CDR grafting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and guided selection using phage display technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, the use of antibody fragments rather than whole antibodies also removes some of the constant regions that may provoke an immune response.</p><p>There has been a growing interest in the use of single-chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies, in which the variable regions of the heavy and light chains are combined in the same polypeptide chain (Huston, 1988 #2785). The advantages of such derivatives are that they can be expressed as single transgenes in various hosts, they fold spontaneously to adopt the correct tertiary structure, and their small size facilitates tissue penetration. The scFv has the heavy and light chain variable regions joined by a flexible peptide linker allowing the two domains to interact, forming a univalent antibody. Alternatively, diabodies have the same structure but the two domains are joined by a shorter, less-flexible linker, forcing dimerization and the formation of divalent antibodies (Holliger, 1993 #3498).</p><p>We have generated human derivatives of the murine Guy's 13 antibody using a chain-shuffling approach based on human antibody variable gene phage-display libraries. We have taken the variable gene regions of the original Guy's 13 monoclonal antibody and created human scFv and diabody derivatives by chain shuffling in human phage-display libraries. Firstly, the heavy chain variable gene of the Guy's 13 construct was introduced into a na&#x000ef;ve human light chain phage display library to select human light chains that, in combination with the murine heavy chain, showed binding specificity for the SAI/II antigen. Once such chimeric antibodies had been selected, the murine heavy chain gene was replaced with the human counterpart, by introducing the selected human light chain genes into a human heavy chain phage display library.</p><p>The resulting clones were expressed in bacteria and tested for specificity in ELISAs using both SAI/II antigen and whole <italic>S. mutans</italic>. The stepwise procedure for generating human antibody chains allows the advantages of scFv and diabody antibody fragments to be exploited without suffering the negative effects of non-human antibodies in a clinical setting. The human antibody fragments were expressed in bacteria as scFv and diabody derivatives and used to aggregate <italic>S. mutans in vitro</italic>. The diabodies were able to aggregate the bacteria and therefore have the potential to be developed as therapeutic agents to treat and/or prevent dental caries.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Human recombinant scFv antibodies against SAI/II</title><p>Human scFv antibody fragments based on the murine monoclonal antibody Guy's 13 were constructed using two consecutive rounds of variable-domain shuffling and phage-library selection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). First, a chimeric scFv was generated by amplifying the murine Guy's 13 heavy chain variable region, and inserting it into a human light chain variable region phage display library. The resulting phage display library had a complexity of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>. Single chain Fv antibody fragments with appropriate binding activities were selected on purified, immobilized SAI/II antigen. Three rounds of selection were carried out and unique candidate antibodies were identified by ELISA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Subsequent sequencing yielded five antibody fragments (chimscFvA1, chimscFvA6, chimscFvA9, chimscFvB4, and chimscFvG4). Sequencing of the human variable genes showed that two of the clones chimscFvA6, chimscFvB4 belonged to family V&#x003ba;1, clone chimscFvA6 was homologous to HK137 and chimscFvB4 was homologous to the L12 germline gene family. ChimscFvA9 belonged to family V&#x003ba;4 DP&#x003ba;24. ChimscFvA1 and chimscFvG4 belonged to family V&#x003bb;3 DPL16) (data not shown). Inhibition ELISA showed that the binding of all six chimeric scFvs to SAI/II could be inhibited by the murine monoclonal antibody Guy's 13. The binding of chimeric scFvs A6, A9, B4 and C6 was inhibited by approximately 80%, suggesting that epitope recognition was maintained (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The binding of the chimeric scFvs A1 and G4 was only inhibited by approximately 30%, suggesting that these antibodies recognized a different epitope.</p><p>The selected human V<sub>L </sub>genes were introduced into a human V<sub>H </sub>library (complexity 8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup>) and a combinatorial library with a complexity of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>was established. Three rounds of selection were carried out in solution using SAI/II antigen coupled to paramagnetic beads. Eleven human scFvs were identified by ELISA (data not shown). Subsequent sequence analysis identified three human scFvs: clones huscFv B10, huscFv D12 and huscFv H6. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> shows the amino acid sequences of the human scFv antibody fragments. The human V<sub>L </sub>domain in chimeric scFv A6 (V&#x003ba;1 HK137) was selected in combination with two different human variable heavy chains, giving human scFvs B10 and H6, respectively. The V<sub>H </sub>domain of human scFv B10 is homologous to V<sub>H</sub>1 family DP10, and the V<sub>H </sub>domain of human scFv H6 is homologous to V<sub>H</sub>3 family DP35. The human V<sub>L </sub>domain in chimeric scFv B4 (V&#x003ba;1 L12) was selected in combination with one human variable heavy chain giving the human scFv D12. The V<sub>H </sub>domain of human scFv D12 is homologous to VH5 family DP73. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> shows the binding of the three human scFvs to the SAI/II antigen and the pathogenic bacterium <italic>S. mutans</italic>. Inhibition ELISA showed that the binding of all three human scFvs to SAI/II was inhibited by Guy's 13, suggesting that epitope recognition was maintained.</p></sec><sec><title>Generation of human diabodies and agglutination of <italic>S. mutans</italic></title><p>Recombinant antibody fragments can be engineered to assemble into stable multimeric oligomers of high binding avidity and specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. A scFv molecule joined by a linker of 3&#x02013;12 residues cannot fold into a functional Fv domain and instead associates with a second scFv molecule to form a bivalent dimer (diabody, approx. 60 kDa). For the cross-linking of cell surface antigens, at least two binding domains are necessary. The diabody is the smallest bivalent antibody molecule that can fulfill this prerequisite. Through reduced off-rates, which result from multiple binding to two target antigens and to rebinding when one Fv dissociates, the diabody is suitable to facilitate specific agglutination of bacteria. We constructed human diabodies by isolating the variable heavy and light chain genes from human scFvs B10, D12 and H6 and murine scFv Guy's 13, amplified by PCR (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) and inserting them in two consecutive steps into the vector pHenIXdia, containing a 10 amino acid residue linker. The integrity of the clones was confirmed by sequencing and the binding activity was demonstrated by ELISA using both the SAI/II antigen and <italic>S. mutans </italic>cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Ma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] reported that bivalent binding of the murine Guy's 13 is required for protection against dental caries, since the F(ab')2 derivative was protective but not the monovalent Fab fragment. <italic>S. mutans </italic>was aggregated in a dose dependent manner when grown in the presence of murine diabody Guy's 13 and human diabody D12 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Antibodies recognizing and neutralizing the oral pathogen <italic>S. mutans </italic>provide a novel approach for the control and prevention of dental caries. A monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the SAI/II surface adhesin of <italic>S. mutans </italic>was isolated by Smith et al. (20) and has been expressed in plants as a secretory IgA (sIgA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In ongoing Phase II clinical trials, this recombinant antibody has been shown to prevent recolonization of the mouth by <italic>S. mutans </italic>when coated onto the teeth and gums following eradication of the bacteria. The sIgA is probably the most appropriate format for the topical application of antibodies that inhibit the colonization of the tooth surface by <italic>S. mutans </italic>because this is the predominant form of antibody naturally found in the saliva. However, each sIgA comprises ten polypeptide chains of four different types making it difficult to produce on a large scale in conventional production systems. The more convenient diabody antibody derivatives, which can be expressed in large quantities in microbial culture systems, may be more suitable for the type of production scales that would be required for the routine control of dental caries using this strategy.</p><p>As a first step in this direction, we have taken the variable gene regions of the original Guy's 13 monoclonal antibody and created human scFv and diabody derivatives by chain shuffling in human phage-display libraries. The heavy chain variable gene of the Guy's 13 construct was introduced into a na&#x000ef;ve human light chain phage display library to select human light chains that, in combination with the murine heavy chain, showed binding specificity for the SAI/II antigen. Once such chimeric antibodies had been selected, the murine heavy chain gene was replaced with the human counterpart, by introducing the selected human light chain genes into a human heavy chain phage display library.</p><p>The resulting clones were expressed in bacteria and tested for specificity in ELISAs using both SAI/II antigen and whole <italic>S. mutans</italic>. The stepwise procedure for generating human antibody chains allows the advantages of scFv and diabody antibody fragments to be exploited without suffering the negative effects of non-human antibodies in a clinical setting. Small scFv and diabody antibody fragments are easy to express in large quantities, they penetrate tissues easily and they lack the constant domains that promote often-unwanted and usually superfluous effector functions. However, where such antibodies are murine in origin, they can provoke an immune reaction in the human host, leading to rapid clearance and poor efficacy during long-term treatment. Since dental caries tends to be chronic rather than acute, murine antibodies would be of little benefit to patients in the long term.</p><p>Two drawbacks of scFvs compared to the ideal sIgA format are monovalency and instability. ScFvs are monovalent because the heavy and light chains are joined by a flexible peptide linker, which allows the two domains to fold and interact with each other. We have addressed this problem by converting the scFv antibodies into diabodies, which is achieved by shortening the linking peptide and forcing the heavy and light chain variable domains to seek interaction partners as part of a dimer. As a consequence of this interaction, the diabody is bivalent like the parent immunoglobulin, and therefore has increased binding avidity. We showed that the bivalent binding of the diabody antibody constructs leads to agglutination of <italic>S. mutans</italic>.</p><p>The problem of decreased stability may be more difficult to address, because the efficacy of scFv and diabody molecules used to treat dental caries will depend largely on their persistence and effective concentration. Secretory IgAs include a secretory component, which protects the antibody from proteolytic degradation in the saliva. One possible solution is to include this secretory component in any scFv or diabody format through the use of further gene fusion strategies. However, it is envisaged that antibodies for the prevention of dental caries will be administered in the form of toothpaste or mouthwash, or perhaps chewing gum, which will allow the treatment to be refreshed at regular intervals.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have shown that the humanization of a murine monoclonal antibody can be easily achieved using a chain-shuffling approach based on scFv antibody phage display libraries. The human antibody derivatives of the murine Guy's 13 antibody can be expressed and isolated from bacteria, recognize SAI/II and <italic>S. mutans </italic>with great specificity, and can successfully aggregate <italic>S. mutans </italic>cells in the dimeric form in a dose dependent manor. These recombinant therapeutic proteins therefore represent the first step towards an inexpensive and convenient general treatment for dental caries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Propagation of <italic>S. mutans</italic></title><p><italic>S. mutans </italic>20523 serological group c was purchased from DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany) and grown in an S2 containment laboratory in trypticase soy yeast extract medium (30 g l<sup>-1 </sup>trypticase soy broth, 3 g l<sup>-1 </sup>yeast extract, pH 7.0&#x02013;7.2) at 37&#x000b0;C for 2 d prior to use.</p></sec><sec><title>Cloning the <italic>S. mutans </italic><italic>spa</italic>P gene encoding surface antigen SAI/II</title><p>Nucleotides 214&#x02013;3048 of the <italic>spa</italic>P gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], which encodes the SAI/II antigen, were removed from pUC18 as a <italic>Sfi</italic>I/<italic>Not</italic>I fragment and inserted into the bacterial expression vectors pCantab5E (Pharmacia) and pSin1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] which had been digested with the same enzymes followed by transformation into <italic>E. coli </italic>TG1.

After centrifugation (4000 &#x000d7; g, 4&#x000b0;C, 30 min), the pellet was resuspended in 10 ml 30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.2) containing 20% sucrose, 1 mM ethylenediaminetretaacetic acid (EDTA), incubated on ice for 15 min and centrifuged as above. The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml 5 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM EDTA and incubated for 15 minutes on ice before a final centrifugation step as above. Both supernatants were pooled, dialyzed against PBS and stored at 4&#x000b0;C.</p><p>Recombinant proteins were also expressed in the periplasm under osmotic stress in the presence of compatible solutes as described by Barth et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].

The culture was diluted 30-fold in 200 ml of the same medium. When the OD<sub>600 nm </sub>of the culture reached 2.0, it was supplemented with 0.5 M sorbitol, 4% NaCl, 40 mM glycine betaine and incubated at 26&#x000b0;C for an additional 30&#x02013;60 min. Expression was induced with 1 mM final concentration IPTG and growth for 6 h at 26&#x000b0;C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 30,000 &#x000d7; g for 10 min. The recombinant antibody fragments were isolated from the periplasmic space as described above. The periplasmic and osmotic shock fractions were pooled and dialyzed against PBS.
