IM remains understudied in many areas of Uganda, as many studies are from urban the capital (Kampala). The long-term goal of this research is the mitigation of IM and poor pregnancy outcomes in Uganda. Insights gained from geographic distribution of IM will allow adaptation of diagnosis, treatments, and interventions within the studied areas. Through using OLS and geographically weighted regression, this study has explored the significant factors and their heterogeneous and scaling effects in 2016 across Uganda. The empirical findings from this study include a significant association between IM and both being unmarried and preferring to speak Luganda when interviewed. Those unmarried may lack a social network to assist with income, childcare, and household chores representing decreased resources. Additionally, being interviewed in Luganda was associated over a large geographic area, which may represent not being comfortable in English, which is the language of education, commerce, and presumably health care, thus suggesting a disconnect with health care settings. These data suggest that strides can be made in Uganda by providing targeted resources to areas with high rates of unmarried mothers and those areas with high rates of Luganda as their language of choice.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="15"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>The data that support the findings of this study are available in the USAID 2016 Uganda Demography and Health Survey <ext-link xlink:href="https://dhsprogram.com/" ext-link-type="uri">https://dhsprogram.com/</ext-link>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>The data that support the findings of this study are available in the USAID 2016 Uganda Demography and Health Survey <ext-link xlink:href="https://dhsprogram.com/" ext-link-type="uri">https://dhsprogram.com/</ext-link>.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infant mortality (IM), or death of an infant under one year of age, represents the overall health of a country at one point in time and allows for comparisons of population health over time [<xref rid="pgph.0002669.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. IM is an important factor in population health as factors that impact infant death, such as access to medicine, health care, and clean water, also affect the health of others in the population [<xref rid="pgph.0002669.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Most (98%) of the 2017 infant deaths in the world occurred in low and middle-income countries [<xref rid="pgph.0002669.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0002669.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In 2017, estimates showed that Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest neonatal mortality rates (death under 28 days/1000 live births) in the world at 27.2 for every 1000 births overall [<xref rid="pgph.0002669.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In Uganda 2018 estimates ranged from 27,889 to 46,361 total infant deaths [<xref rid="pgph.0002669.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These disparities and their sequelae have been previously described in parts of Uganda and other resource-limited settings [<xref rid="pgph.0002669.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgph.0002669.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Uganda has made significant improvements in mitigating IM. The mortality rates in Uganda were, by far, much higher in 1990 as compared to the global average rate. According to a UNICEF report, 18.4% of the children born in Uganda in 1990 died. The proportion was reduced to 4.6% in 2018 [<xref rid="pgph.0002669.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To further improve Uganda&#x02019;s IM mitigation requires introducing policies that would enhance the awareness and ability of parents to provide necessary care. Some factors, such as poverty and illiteracy, are social issues that influence more than IM rates. Understanding the risk factors for IM can enhance the formulation of strategies for future mitigation. For example, one of the Ugandan government&#x02019;s actions to reduce the rate of child mortality included introducing the country-wide free prenatal and postnatal services [<xref rid="pgph.0002669.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Geographically weighted regression (GWR) allows for the development of local level estimates and compares them to their neighbors to produce maps and statistics that look at the processes behind spatial heterogeneity, while still comparing to a larger unit or the global process. A GWR model can be considered a type of regression model with geographically varying parameters. One of GWR&#x02019;s strengths is that it can be used in estimating parameters anywhere within the study area provided a dependent variable along with a set of one or more variables is known. Another strength of the GWR is its applicability in examining the geographical patterns of long-term conditions, which is useful in limiting long-term poor health outcomes. In this case, the long-term condition includes those that might have stemmed from exposure to work-related risks, poor housing conditions, lack of social support (being unmarried), and stress-related conditions (unintended pregnancy, young maternal age). Application of GWR in the investigation of the relationships between infant deaths and social phenomenon quantitatively helps in investigating whether there is an existing stable relationship over space or whether they vary to reflect the features of different localities within the study area, possibly representing unmeasured variables that fluctuate geographically [<xref rid="pgph.0002669.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. GWR allows stimulus-response visualization and an understanding of how the relationship changes in space.</p><p>IM remains understudied within Uganda, as many of the previously cited studies are from the capital (Kampala) or central Uganda [<xref rid="pgph.0002669.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0002669.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

Through using GWR, the long-term objective of this project is to explore geographic patterns of IM in Uganda particularly focusing on unique geographic factors associated with IM. The aims of this study were to characterize the geographic distribution of IM and associated factors in 2016 Uganda, adjusting for infant, maternal, and community risk factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods and materials</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Setting</title><p>The Republic of Uganda is in East Central Africa.

If a variable was determined to not be normally distributed a natural log was used. Each of the variables with 0 in the weighted frequency were changed to 0.00001 for analysis purposes. Significance at the 0.05 level was used.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The analysis was a secondary analysis conducted on publicly available data from Uganda.

One of GWR&#x02019;s strengths is that it can be used in estimating parameters anywhere within the study area provided a dependent variable along with a set of one or more variables that have already been measured. This study showed the strengths of GWR by showing that districts with high rates of being unmarried and preferring to speak Luganda for their UDHS interview were significantly associated with infant deaths, but in different locations. These are both what we consider proxy measures or measures that represent something more than just those characteristics. As we know, being unmarried at the birth of a child often represents a lack of a social network to assist with income, childcare, and household chores, thus may represent an area with decreased resources consequently in higher need. Additionally, being interviewed in Luganda was associated in a large area, which may represent not being comfortable speaking English, which is the language of education, commerce, and presumably health care, thus suggesting a disconnect with health care settings. Luganda is spoken in the highly populated south- and south-central parts of Uganda and therefore is a common spoken language.</p><p>These data suggest that strides can be made in Uganda by providing targeted resources to areas with high rates of unmarried mothers and with high rates of Luganda as their language of choice. Moreover, these districts are focused specifically on areas of west-central and south-southwestern regions of Uganda. These data suggest as well that these are areas of high IM where strong local associations exist (with high local r<sup>2</sup> values). In short, these variables were the only two that reached significance among all variables suggesting that they are important explanatory variables, though they are not causal but associated with IM.</p><p>This study is at risk for ecological fallacy and no assumption of an individual&#x02019;s or even household differences should be made. In addition, the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) must be considered. While these are the smallest geographic units available, they are administrative units and not natural boundaries [<xref rid="pgph.0002669.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgph.0002669.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. By using the adjusted bandwidth MAUP, the different size of units and edge issues are less problematic, but still need to be considered [<xref rid="pgph.0002669.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The uncertain geographic context problem, that individuals interact differently not only than each other but at different times and in different contexts, must also be considered [<xref rid="pgph.0002669.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pgph.0002669.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We used the district of residence rather than the UDHS GIS files for geographic location thus we did not need to consider the masking of GPS locations [<xref rid="pgph.0002669.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The survey utilized a complex survey design, thus understanding the weighting and sample selection is important to understand outcomes and limitation.</p><p>Despite the varied strengths of GWR, there are some potential limitations. To begin with, database errors such as selective omission from birth histories among deceased infants which may be due to interviewer bias or even respondent fatigue or bias [<xref rid="pgph.0002669.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Secondly, the GWR works effectively only in the case where independent variables have a positive correlation. The method does not work correctly when independent variables negatively correlate [<xref rid="pgph.0002669.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Another drawback of GWR is that it assumes that every relationship being modeled diverges at one single scale; this consequently limits the ability to characterize spatial context. Similarly, with GWR, the same bandwidth is presumed to be applicable for every relationship within the model, which implies that data are weighted at a standard spatial scale. GWR is unable to alleviate the occurrence of an outlier and spatial autocorrelation that tends to pose a unique challenge resulting in instability in its spatial estimates. It is not clear how cluster sampling impacts this study. Lastly we used the weighted percentages for each district, thus, there should be limited bias due to this factor.</p><p>Despite these limitations, the findings of different associations in specific geographic areas are still important due to the high rates of IM in Uganda. Moreover, this article provides some high-risk areas of IM and their associated independent variables. The results invite further studies of social and demographic characteristics associated with IM throughout Uganda [<xref rid="pgph.0002669.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to acknowledge Reece Anderson who assisted with development of this paper.
