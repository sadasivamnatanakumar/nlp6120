Direct costs covered eye- and non-eye-related hospitalizations and outpatient visits, outpatient health care services, and travel costs among participants aged 30 years or older, adjusted for age and sex. Indirect costs covered premature retirement and productivity losses among participants aged 30&#x02013;64 years. Glaucoma patients (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 192) were compared with non-glaucomatous population (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 6,952).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Results</title><p>The annual additional total direct costs were EUR 2,660/glaucoma patient, EUR 1,769/glaucoma patient with medication, and EUR 3,979/operated glaucoma patient compared with persons without glaucoma. The respective additional total indirect costs were EUR 4,288, EUR 3,246, and EUR 12,902 per year. In total, the additional annual direct and indirect expenditures associated with glaucoma in Finland were EUR 202 million (0.86% of total expenditures of health care) and EUR 71 million (0.03% of the Finnish gross domestic product) arising mainly from non-eye-related hospitalizations and productivity losses, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Glaucoma is associated with an increased health care consumption mainly due to non-eye-related health care, which can be explained by the vision loss as well as increased number of co-morbidities among glaucoma patients. Therefore, glaucoma constitutes a major economic burden for the health care system and society, highlighting the importance of early glaucoma interventions. The difference in direct and indirect costs between glaucoma treatment groups is explained by the uneven distribution of co-morbidities.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

Globally, over 70 million individuals suffer from glaucoma [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In Finland, there are over 80,000 glaucoma patients, of which approximately 8% are visually impaired with visual acuity (VA) lower than 0.3 (Snellen decimals) [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295523.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The prevalence of glaucoma is increasing globally due to the rapidly growing number of older people [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295523.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295523.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Other risk factors for glaucoma besides age include elevated intraocular pressure, family history, presence of exfoliative material, myopia, and African ethnicity [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Currently, there are three types of glaucoma treatments: drugs, surgical procedures, and laser treatments [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Even though timely and effective treatment could prevent the deterioration of vision, glaucoma remains as one of the leading causes of blindness worldwide. Furthermore, the low public awareness, the asymptomatic early stages of glaucoma, and the non-adherence to prescribed therapy can lead to inadequate control of glaucoma, with severe consequences for both the individual and the society [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Given the social consequences of glaucoma and the limited resources available to health care providers, it is crucial to provide appropriate information to facilitate the decision making and the allocation of health care resources. However, the impact of glaucoma on total direct and indirect costs at population level is not well known. Majority of the previous glaucoma-related publications have focused on comparing different treatment modalities at clinical settings [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Few studies have estimated either direct or indirect costs of glaucoma and its treatment [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Hence, there is a need for a comprehensive picture of the economic burden of glaucoma including all eye- and non-eye-related direct and indirect costs associated with the disease&#x02014;for example, hospitalizations due to falls and injuries. More population-wide studies are also required to corroborate the previous findings and to provide accurate estimates of the costs in different nationwide settings. Furthermore, the use of multiple data sources, such as national surveys and registers, is uncommon, even though it could provide more accurate estimates on the use of health care services and both direct and indirect costs. Therefore, our aim was to evaluate the economic impact of glaucoma and its treatment on the Finnish society by combining the data of a nationwide health examination survey and national health registers, estimating both direct and indirect costs associated with the disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Study design, data, and population</title><p>The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) conducted the nationwide Health 2000 survey which collected comprehensive information on health and well-being in Finland during 2000&#x02013;2001 [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The representative sample of the Finnish adult population was selected by utilizing a probability-clustered sampling and weighting scheme. The survey included a face-to-face interview, self-administered questionnaires, and a thorough health examination. The sample included 8,028 subjects aged 30 years and older, and the unweighted participation rate was 93%. The sample weights were calibrated by post-stratification, defined by age, sex, region, and native language to account for non-response and missing data. The details of the survey methods have been published elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Information on the use of outpatient health care services was collected in the interview, including the number of private, occupational, health center, and other doctor visits, and the number of occupational, home care, and outpatient nurse visits during the preceding 12 months.</p><p>The habitual distance VA was measured in the health examination by an educated study nurse binocularly at 4 m.

Data on entitlements to reimbursement for glaucoma medication (during 1965&#x02013;2011) and the number of glaucoma medication prescriptions (ATC S01E; 1999&#x02013;2011) of the survey participants were obtained from the registers maintained by the Social Insurance Institution of Finland (Kela). Data on the diagnoses and operations of the survey participants were obtained from the Care Registers for Social Welfare and Health Care maintained by the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare. The care register data covered inpatient care visits (Hilmo, 1968&#x02013;2011), which included the number and length of hospitalizations, and specialized health care outpatient visits (AvoHilmo, 1997&#x02013;2011). A follow-up time was calculated for each participant separately to account for the survival of the participants. The period of scrutinization was extended to 13 years (1.1.1999&#x02013;31.12.2011) to represent the mean annual usage more accurately. The follow-up durations were corrected for participants who had died during the follow-up period (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 1,279) with a range of 1.2&#x02013;13.0 years. We included all eye- and non-eye-related hospitalizations and outpatient visits.

We utilized a prevalence-based bottom-up approach to assess both the direct and indirect costs associated with glaucoma. The direct costs were based on registered hospitalizations and outpatient visits, self-reported outpatient health care services, and travel costs for outpatient visits during the follow-up. Unit costs were converted to 2019 level in the analyses based on the most recent estimates on health expenditure and financing in Finland [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and they are listed in <xref rid="pone.0295523.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>. Public health care costs included laboratory, administrative, and other collateral costs. For private practitioners, we examined mean administrative costs of three major private health care service providers and in the analyses, we applied weighted average according to the market shares. The proportions of emergency and non-emergency visits have been applied to the unit costs for outpatient visits based on Sotkanet-database and the outpatient visit data from Pirkanmaa Hospital District: in 2019, the proportions of emergency visits were 37.2% in primary health care, 9.8% in specialized health care, and 8.4% specifically for ophthalmologists. Based on the features of Finnish health care system, current proportions are the most precise estimates we can provide. The unit costs do not include the customer fees as our focus was on societal costs. Drug costs and direct non-health care costs excluding transportation were not included in the study as appropriate data were not available. The calculation of travel costs for outpatient visits has been described previously [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The indirect costs comprised premature retirement and related productivity losses. The number of premature retirement years was calculated for each person with known time of retirement, starting from age of 30 years up to 64 years. If the person was known to have retired, but the time of retirement was not known, the average retirement age in the population was used instead, separately for glaucoma groups (59.5 years, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 11) and glaucoma negatives (57.4 years, <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 268). If the person was older at the time of the survey than the average age, the age at the time of the survey was used (Health 2000 or 2011, 42 glaucoma negatives). If the person had died before age of 65 years during the follow-up, the years were calculated up to age at death. If the person was younger than 65 years during the follow-up, the years were calculated up to age in 2011. Productivity losses were calculated using the premature retirement years. The annual indirect costs were estimated by dividing the total costs by the mean duration of working career in Finland (32.6 years in 2011) [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The indirect costs were also converted to 2019 euros in the analyses (<xref rid="pone.0295523.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>).

One glaucoma negative and one verified glaucoma patient were excluded from further analyses as high outliers. Age- and sex-adjusted costs as well as non-adjusted costs were calculated. We estimated the total costs at population level by applying the weights. As the data were continuous and quantitative, we calculated means, standard deviations, and standard errors.

The comprehensive data allowed us to include eye- and non-eye-related treatments, as well as to compare glaucoma with other co-morbidities. Here we show that glaucoma is associated with a high economic burden on the society. The major proportion of the costs is not directly caused by treatment of glaucoma, but rather the increased use of non-eye-related health services, as well as loss of productivity. In addition, different treatment options for glaucoma show noticeable differences in costs and resource use.</p><p>We calculated age- and sex-adjusted costs because glaucoma patients are in average 20 years older than persons without glaucoma. In 2019, the expenditures of health care in Finland were EUR 23.4 billion in total [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In the present study, the adjusted direct additional expenditures associated with glaucoma corresponded to 0.86% (EUR 202,094,791) of this cost. The prevalence of glaucoma in Finnish adult population is approximately 2.6% [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and this figure is likely to increase due to the rapid ageing of the Finnish population. Therefore, the direct costs of glaucoma can be considered significant, and this economic burden is likely to increase in the future with increasing life expectancy and shifting in age distribution in Finland and other developed countries.</p><p>While glaucoma care has been organized in different ways around the world, glaucoma is globally considered a major burden for health care resources. In the US, the annual direct medical costs of glaucoma were estimated to be USD 2.9 billion in 2004 [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In Australia, the annual direct eye-related costs of glaucoma were estimated to be AUD 144.2 million in 2004 [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In both countries, the direct medical costs of glaucoma corresponded to 8% of total medical costs of visual disorders [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295523.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Furthermore, the costs of glaucoma are usually considered underestimated due to the high percentage of undiagnosed glaucoma [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295523.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Despite the economic implications of glaucoma, few studies have provided nationwide estimations of all direct and indirect costs of the disease. In 1990 in the UK, the direct medical costs associated with glaucoma were GBP 61 million, direct non-medical costs GBP 25 million among visually impaired, and indirect costs GBP 45 million [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In a more recent study in Nigeria, Adio and Onua reported an annual direct and indirect loss of USD 1,265 per person for treatment of glaucoma, resulting in a total expenditure of USD 4,095,000 [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, both studies only included costs related to glaucoma treatment, which explains why the average costs are lower than in our study. Finally, in a review by Dirani et al., they created a prediction model on primary open-angle glaucoma in Australia that during 2005&#x02013;2025 direct health system costs will increase from AUD 355 million to AUD 784 million and total costs (direct and indirect) from AUD 1.9 billion to AUD 4.3 billion [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>Medication represents the major cost of glaucoma treatment. In the US, the cost of glaucoma care for Medicare beneficiaries was USD 748 million in 2009 [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In Sweden and France, the respective annual costs of glaucoma treatment were EUR 531 and EUR 390 per patient, with medication costs comprising approximately half of the total costs [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In Denmark, the annual treatment cost was EUR 305 per glaucoma patient under their initial regimen, of which 57% was accounted by glaucoma drugs [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In Finland, the total cost of glaucoma medication was EUR 25.5 million in 2011 with an average of EUR 352 per patient [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. When adding the direct eye-related treatment costs in our study (EUR 393 per patient), the average annual glaucoma treatment cost per medicated glaucoma patient at 2019-level would be EUR 745, 47% consisting of medication costs, which is within the range of previous glaucoma resource utilization studies. The high costs associated with glaucoma medicine are likely due to the increased consumption of anti-glaucoma drugs in recent decades and the use of newer and more expensive drugs [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Furthermore, the severity of glaucoma has been reported to increase the direct costs of its treatment [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295523.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>There has not been definitive conclusion on whether medical or surgical treatment of glaucoma is more cost-effective [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In our study, operated glaucoma patients showed higher use of outpatient care and hospitalization than medicated patients. Although this difference was not statistically significant, it becomes particularly noticeable when costs are considered: even after adjusting for age and sex, the annual total direct costs are EUR 2,210 (31.2%) higher for an operated patient than medicated patient. Still, if the estimated drug costs [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] are added to the expenditures associated with medicated glaucoma, the expenditures for medicated glaucoma patients are higher than reported. The annual indirect costs for an operated patient are EUR 9,656 (49.5%) higher compared with a medicated patient. Patients needing glaucoma surgery are in general more often unable to take care of their medication due to their co-morbidities. This is one of the possible explanations why glaucoma patients only treated with surgery showed higher total direct costs than glaucoma patients only treated with medication. It is also important to remember that glaucoma surgery is in many cases the last option to prevent the progression of glaucoma and consequent visual loss, both of which are associated with additional direct and indirect costs.</p><p>Despite the role of treatment in the economic burden of glaucoma observed in previous studies, in our study, majority of the direct health care costs came from non-eye-related services. We also observed a significant increase in the average time spent hospitalized among glaucoma patients in comparison to non-glaucomatous population. This is most likely related to the irreversible vision loss associated with glaucoma and its progression. The severity of visual impairment increases the resource consumption and intensity of care likely due to the increased risk of falls, accidents, and injuries associated with decreased vision [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Indeed, glaucoma patients have been reported increased risk of falls and other accidents, which contribute to significant amount of bed days with an economic and operational impact on the hospitals [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Vision loss is associated with high economic impact [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and the costs among blinded patients can be twice the amount among patients with normal vision [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Also, we observed a strong relationship between decreasing vision and both increasing direct and indirect costs regardless of glaucoma status. Therefore, the role of early intervention in glaucoma care to prevent the progression of visual impairment is vital in alleviating the economic burden of the disease to the society, as well as the detrimental effect on quality of life, independence, and social activity of the patient [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295523.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295523.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In addition, the impact of vision on the societal costs calls for further research.</p><p>The indirect costs associated with glaucoma are also considerable. The Finnish gross domestic product was EUR 239.9 billion in 2019 according to the Statistics Finland -database. Additional productivity losses caused by glaucoma alone corresponded to 0.03% (EUR 71,233,046) of the product that year. Loss of productivity among glaucoma patients is likely contributable to vision loss associated with the disease, as visual impairment is associated with nursing home admission, falls, injuries, accidents, and femur fracturs, all of which can lead to work invalidity [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Visual impairment and blindness are regarded as major causes of productivity losses worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Therefore, by preventing the progression of vision loss due to glaucoma with early diagnosis and prompt and adhered treatment, significant economic losses could be averted.</p><p>Both direct and indirect glaucoma costs showed strong dependency on vision and other co-morbidities. These factors are associated either directly with glaucoma or indirectly through ageing [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], which likely explains this effect. However, the indirect additional costs of operated glaucoma are significant even after adjusting for these co-morbidities, which implies the severity and specific surgical indications of the operated glaucoma patients.</p><p>The strengths of our study include the representative sample of the Finnish adult population, the multiple data sources, and the long follow-up period that increase the validity and reliability of the results. The Health 2000 Survey addressed public health issue more broadly than national surveys do on average. The survey sample represents the population particularly well due to the comprehensive sampling design and the high participation rate. This allowed us to include a sample of glaucoma patients and negatives at national level rather than from clinical settings. The data design of the national health survey reduces the impact of potential confounding factors, which was further reduced by controlling the co-morbidities and other confounding factors using multivariable modelling. In addition, the applied weighting scheme improves the applicability to population level. Our prevalence-based bottom-up approach aids to avoid the misallocation of costs, which is more likely to occur in top-down approach [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Although prevalence-based approach may not accurately quantify the long-term consequences of the study condition leading to underestimation of costs [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], our long, 13-year follow-up time should alleviate the potential bias associated with this approach.</p><p>Our study also has limitations that need to be addressed. While our use of multiple data sources can be regarded as a major strength, it also can produce difficulties in processing and integrating data as its availability varied between sources. The time differences between key inputs should be considered, as the data were collected during a 13-year follow-up time during 1999&#x02013;2011 and the costs were converted to the 2019 level. We could not differentiate eye- and non-eye-related self-reported outpatient health care service visits. While the share of ophthalmologist visits in health centers should be small, the share among private practitioners can be higher, therefore causing bias. We were not able include laboratory costs in private health care in the calculations due to the classified nature of the data. However, laboratory costs are included in public health care unit costs, which should alleviate this deficiency in total cost analyses. We were also unable to include the costs of care outside the health system as well as non-health care costs, for example, those caused by social services, childcare, and housekeeping. Drugs and prescriptions were also not included in the cost analyses, although we discussed their share based on the medication cost estimations by Parkkari and co-workers [<xref rid="pone.0295523.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. While the cost of disability pensions and premature retirement were included, productivity losses might be underestimated because we were not able to get data on sick leaves. Despite this, the estimated costs in this study are generalizable to the Finnish adult population or to a similar setting in terms of population age structure and financial support system from government, such as all Nordic countries and several European countries. Glaucoma classifications were based on register data on observations made by a private ophthalmologist, which can cause biases: for example, high intraocular pressure may have been diagnosed as glaucoma, even though it may not have been the case.</p><p>In conclusion, we report annual direct and indirect additional expenditures of EUR 202,094,791 and EUR 71,233,046 among glaucomatous population in Finland. Therefore, glaucoma is a significant economic burden on the health care and society. Majority of the direct expenses come from non-eye-related hospitalizations, and productivity losses comprise most of the indirect expenses. The need for expensive hospitalization is most likely contributable to the progressing vision loss and consequent increase in risk of injuries and accidents among glaucoma patients. The high age and consequent increase in co-morbidities among glaucoma patients are also contributable factors to the additional costs of glaucoma. Moreover, different glaucoma treatments show substantial variability in costs and resource use, most probably due to the uneven distribution of co-morbidities. Given the limited resources available to health care providers, early-stage interventions to prevent glaucoma progression as well as allocating sufficient resources to ophthalmic care are a necessity to avoid economic challenges in the future as the population ages. The increased allocation may pay itself off multiple times with the future savings.
