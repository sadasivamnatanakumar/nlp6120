Antibiotic use has been shown to be the major driver of antibiotic resistance, and interventions to reduce unnecessary prescribing are urgently needed [<xref rid="pone.0295908.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>However, as antibiotic resistance increases globally, it becomes more difficult to select and provide adequate empiric antibiotic therapy while adhering with the principles of antibiotic stewardship, particularly in patients with life-threatening infections who stand to benefit the most from early adequate treatment [<xref rid="pone.0295908.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295908.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Suspected sepsis is one of the most common indications for the empiric use of broad spectrum antibiotics given the high short-term mortality risk associated with this condition and need to provide timely effective therapy [<xref rid="pone.0295908.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, the strategy of simply broadening the spectrum of empiric antibiotic treatment for all patients is not ideal, as many individuals will have infections that can be treated with narrower antibiotics, and this practice likely favors development of further resistance to reserve agents both for the individual and populations.</p><p>Current available evidence suggests that the use of computerized clinical decision support tools can increase the percentage of patients that receive desired care, but robust evidence on the use of this approach in patients with suspected sepsis is limited [<xref rid="pone.0295908.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Two previous studies indicated that clinical decision support algorithms including mathematical models and rules based on an individual&#x02019;s historic microbiology results, could be used to predict individual risk factors for resistance and successfully guide antibiotic selection [<xref rid="pone.0295908.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295908.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. While effective, these approaches were limited by their focus on either Gram-positive or Gram-negative pathogens (separately) and were applied only after preliminary culture results were available. To improve on these, we have developed an encompassing algorithm, using modelling and rules, that considers all potential bacteria and can be used at the most critical empiric window (prior to microbiologic results). This early sepsis treatment algorithm could permit a narrower spectrum empiric therapy, while supporting the adequacy of coverage, allowing each patient to be on the right drug at the right time. This approach offers the potential for maximal benefits in adequate coverage and antibiotic stewardship by intervening earlier at the time of clinical presentation. However, early intervention poses additional challenges, and so our approach requires further validation before large-scale clinical implementation.</p><p>In this observational study, adult patients admitted at a large academic tertiary care center were prospectively reviewed to evaluate an early sepsis treatment algorithm. We hypothesized that the use of this new algorithm would have the potential to support early de-escalation recommendations while maintaining or improving adequacy of treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study setting, design, and participants</title><p>We performed a prospective observational study to evaluate the expected impact of an early sepsis treatment algorithm. This study was carried out at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Ontario, Canada, from November to December 2021. The ethics committee of Sunnybrook Research Institute has waived ethics approval and individual consent requirement for this project as it was deemed a quality improvement project by Sunnybrook Research Institute Ethics Review&#x02013;Self Assessment Tool (ER&#x02013;SAT).

The following exclusion criteria were applied: (1) patients already included in the study during prior episodes of early sepsis; (2) those receiving palliative care; (3) those who were pregnant; (4) other inpatient antibiotic use in the prior 72 hours; and (5) positive clinical culture associated within the index event available at the time of assessment. A roster of patients was generated twice daily during business hours Monday&#x02014;Friday to identify patients that met the above criteria within the prior 24 hours. Patient charts were reviewed in real-time, and the early sepsis treatment algorithm was applied to determine the recommended antibiotic regimen for eligible patients.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0295908.g001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0295908.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p>A.

This combined sepsis treatment algorithm was derived from rules and modelled prediction approaches that were developed and tested for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative infections [<xref rid="pone.0295908.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295908.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The Gram-negative prediction model is as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0295908.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and in brief consists of multiple parametric regression models which predict the likelihood of susceptibility for each commonly used antibiotic for Gram-negative pathogens, based on epidemiologic predictors (age, sex, prior hospitalization, prior ICU stay, prior antibiotic exposure) and prior culture results (prior antibiotic-resistant organisms from clinical cultures in the preceding year). These Gram- negative parametric models were validated and calibrated on historical culture data from the institution under study [<xref rid="pone.0295908.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The Gram-positive algorithm is based on a previous prospective observational study and directs the addition or cessation of vancomycin based on prior methicillin-resistant <italic toggle="yes">Staph</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aureus</italic> (MRSA)screen cultures (<xref rid="pone.0295908.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0295908.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For infections treated with a standard empiric regimen, regardless of patient &#x02018;s risk factors, local guidelines for empiric therapy were applied (this included cellulitis, community- acquired pneumonia and meningitis). The treatment algorithm assumes an <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic> antibiotic cascade for the treatment of Gram-negative pathogens, with the following antibiotics considered from broadest to narrowest respectively (meropenem&#x0003e;piperacillin- tazobactam&#x0003e;ceftazidime&#x0003e;ceftriaxone&#x0003e;ciprofloxacin). It seeks to move the prescriber down the antibiotic selection cascade to generally narrower spectrum agents by recommending the narrowest spectrum agent that still exceeds a pre-specified threshold of adequate coverage (80% for patients with a quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score &#x0003c;2, 90% for patients with a qSOFA score &#x0003e; 2 or receiving vasopressor support) [<xref rid="pone.0295908.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. When the clinical syndrome was deemed to require Gram-positive coverage (other than MRSA coverage) which the narrowest choice did not provide, the next antibiotic that provided Gram-positive coverage, moving up the cascade, was selected as the appropriate antibiotic to cover the clinical syndrome. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the potential impact of an early sepsis treatment algorithm, and therefore we did not provide treatment recommendations to the clinical team; the results of this pilot will inform further rigorous prospective evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Outcomes and predictor variables</title><p>The main outcome measure of this study was the proportion of patients whom de-escalation from the primary antibiotic regimen was recommended by our proposed approach. De-escalation was defined as movement down the Gram-negative antibiotic cascade or the cessation of vancomycin or daptomycin. Escalation was defined as movement up the Gram-negative antibiotic cascade or addition of vancomycin or daptomycin. If antibiotics were not changed, then these were considered as &#x02018;No change&#x02019; in spectrum. In some instances, antibiotics were changed to those not included in our antibiotic cascade (e.g., levofloxacin for community acquired pneumonia by local guidelines), or atypical antimicrobial coverage was added (e.g., azithromycin for atypical organism coverage in CAP). For these instances we typically considered these guideline-based changes as equivalent in spectrum (e.g., we classified guideline directed prescribing with levofloxacin or ceftriaxone/azithromycin for CAP as equivalent spectrum-level). We also assumed no change in spectrum-level with the addition of atypical or anaerobic specific adjunctive agents such as azithromycin or metronidazole. We considered the following agents not listed in our antibiotic cascade as equivalent levels of spectrum (i.e., there would be no change in spectrum with a change of agent): (1) ertapenem and meropenem; and (2) ceftazidime and gentamicin.</p><p>Secondary outcomes that we evaluated included: (1) the proportion of patients where escalation was recommended; (2) the number of de-escalation steps along the antibiotic cascade that would be achieved; and (3) the proportions of culture-positive patients who would receive adequate therapy with a given regimen (suggested vs. actual). Adequacy of therapy could only be determined for the subset of patients with a culture-positive infection. To describe the study population and stratify by relevant factors, we collected the following predictor variables: age, sex, qSOFA score [<xref rid="pone.0295908.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], neutropenia, vasopressor use, mechanical ventilation, antibiotics prescribed at the time of assessment, clinical cultures, and prior MRSA screening cultures.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary and secondary outcomes were described using proportions for binary and categorical variables and medians and interquartile ranges for continuous variables. A comparison between the proportion of patients receiving adequate therapy for suggested versus received antibiotic therapy was performed using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. Some outcomes were stratified by relevant covariates.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec012"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Patient characteristics</title><p>We reviewed 578 charts for eligibility during the study period, of which 471 were excluded (<xref rid="pone.0295908.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>).

In the small number of patients who were recommended escalation by algorithm, half of these (5/10, 50%) involved changing patients&#x02019; antimicrobial recommendation from piperacillin-tazobactam to meropenem due to a significant predicted risk for resistant Gram-negative pathogens.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0295908.t002"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0295908.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Distribution of antibiotics received by the patients compared with those antibiotics recommended by the Early-IDEAS algorithm.</title><p>These are further stratified by whether the Early-IDEAS algorithm had recommended escalation, de-escalation, or no change.

For 17 patients with clinically relevant positive blood cultures, adequate antibiotics were prescribed by the clinical team in 12 (70.6%) patients. When applying the treatment algorithm for these same patients, the percentage of adequate empiric antibiotic recommendations was unchanged (70.6%, p = 1), and 7 of these 12 patients would have been de-escalated from their given therapy. For 25 patients with clinically relevant positive (non-blood) clinical cultures, adequate antibiotics were prescribed in 20 (80%) patients by the clinical team. When applying the treatment algorithm for these same patients, the percentage of adequate treatment recommendations was unchanged (80%, p = 1), and 6 of these 20 patients would have been de-escalated from their given therapy. For 5 patients with clinically relevant cultures in both blood and non-sterile sites, adequate antibiotics were prescribed in 3 (60%) patients by the clinical team. When applying the treatment algorithm for these same patients, the percentage of treatment recommendations was unchanged (60%, p = 1), and 2 of these 5 patients had adequate coverage through de-escalation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this prospective validation of the study of the Early-IDEAS decision support algorithm we show that patients with suspected sepsis can be treated with narrower antibiotic agents while maintaining the adequacy of initial empiric coverage. The decision support algorithm we employed recommended de-escalation in almost half of all eligible patients, with a high proportion of blood and non-blood isolates adequately covered. Less than 1 in 10 patients had an escalation of antibiotics recommended. The Gram-negative prediction used, in brief, consists of multiple parametric regression models. The treatment algorithm assumes an <italic toggle="yes">a priori</italic> antibiotic cascade for the treatment of Gram-negative pathogens and seeks to move the prescriber down the antibiotic selection cascade to generally narrower spectrum agents.</p><sec id="sec017"><title>Interpretation</title><p>Clinical decision support tools for selecting antimicrobials in infectious syndromes are not new [<xref rid="pone.0295908.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; however, studies evaluating sepsis-specific support are less frequent. To date, there have been a few studies evaluating support tools in the management of sepsis, though they are often focused on other (non-prescribing) aspects of management, including identifying prognosis and severity, determining likely discharge disposition, and the need for early treatment [<xref rid="pone.0295908.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295908.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We did not identify any decision support tools developed for empiric antibiotic selection in early sepsis that have been evaluated in a prospective randomized fashion, and there is a clear need for validated support models that can be tested in rigorous prospective trials.</p><p>Clinical decision support models, such as the Early-IDEAS treatment algorithm validated in this study, can be powered by institution-specific predictive models that could address the two competing aspects of antimicrobial stewardship: (1) the desire to retain high adequacy of empiric coverage while (2) reducing the breadth of antibiotic spectrum used to reduce the selection of resistance to reserve antimicrobial agents. Our algorithm demonstrated a significant number of patients can be de-escalated while maintaining a similar and adequate level of antibiotic coverage. Our approach fundamentally allows the provider to differentiate between patients that do not require broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy and those that do. Explicit, informed, and reproducible models have the potential to broadly support providers of all experience levels and backgrounds to operationalize antibiotic decision-making.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Limitations &#x00026; generalizability</title><p>This study is intended as a pilot of early clinical decision support, and so is not powered to evaluate downstream clinical benefits of early de-escalation (such as reduction in antimicrobial costs, complications, and resistance) or the downstream benefits of adequate coverage (such as rapidity of clinical cure, reduced lengths of hospital stay and increased survival). The mathematical algorithms underpinning the decision support are derived from culture-positive infections, and we cannot be certain that culture-negative infections are caused by the same distribution of pathogens; this limitation is also intrinsic to any antibiogram-based predictions which are used as a gold standard for supporting empiric prescribing [<xref rid="pone.0295908.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Similarly, as anticipated, only a subset of enrolled patients (34.6%) had microbiologically confirmed and clinically relevant pathogens, and so for the remainder we are unable to compare the adequacy of coverage of the regimens recommended by the treating team versus our decision support algorithm. This is an expected trade-off of intervening early among patients presenting with sepsis. It is also important to note that the antibiotics evaluated in this study, and recommended by the Early-IDEAS algorithm, are systemic antibiotics which would penetrate the majority of infection sites.</p><p>This pilot was designed to refine our algorithms and did not involve actual communication of treatment recommendations to the treating team, so we are not yet able to confirm whether clinicians will accept this decision support. However, prior work has suggested high uptake of recommendations [<xref rid="pone.0295908.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295908.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and so we expect high uptake with future implementation of this decision support. Lastly, we found that concurrent MRSA swab results were generally not available at the early time points of assessment for patients during this pandemic period, and thus the Gram-positive arm of the algorithm was of limited utility for recommending cessation of vancomycin.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we demonstrate that a combined Gram-positive and Gram-negative decision support algorithm in early sepsis (Early-IDEAS) could help improve empiric antibiotic treatment by offering providers with narrower spectrum treatment options while maintaining high adequacy of therapy. This treatment algorithm requires further prospective evaluation to determine acceptability and efficacy. The time has come for the adoption of personalized medicine in sepsis treatment, and individualized models to support treatment selection may help us choose the right antibiotic at the right time.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0295908.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Global action plan on antimicrobial resistance [Internet].

</p><p><!-- <div> -->PONE-D-23-03428<!-- </div> --><!-- <div> -->A sepsis treatment algorithm to improve early antibiotic de-escalation while maintaining adequacy of coverage (Early-IDEAS): A prospective observational study<!-- </div> --><!-- <div> -->PLOS ONE</p><p>Dear Dr. BUCHEERI,</p><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#x02019;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p><p>&#x000a0;<!-- </div> --><!-- <div> -->========================<!-- </div> --><!-- <div> -->The present decision is based on my inspection of the manuscript without input from external peer reviewers yet. This is because there are several major issues with the results which require clarification before the manuscript could be sent out for review. These are:<!-- </div> --><!-- <div> -->1. Table 2 - the current presentation is confusing; the text (L253-261) accompanying the table described the recommendations in terms of patients, but the table presented the recommendations in relation to each antibiotic. Furthermore, it's unclear how the table is divided into 2 halves, antibiotics prescribed by team and recommended by algorithm. For example, for "no change" in ceftriaxone and meropenem, the numbers are 20 and 1 in the first half, but 22 and 2 in the second half.<!-- </div> --><!-- <div> -->2. Table 3 - similar issue as table 2. It's unclear how the numbers for each recommendation category should be interpreted with respect to each column. Also, for this patient subgroup (n=37), it can be inferred that 5 have both positive blood and non-sterile site cultures positive results, but the antibiotics given would obviously be systemic and apply to both (in most cases, though there are exceptions like daptomycin being useful for bacteremia but not pneumonia). It would be important to verify that the antibiotics given or recommended be adequate to cover both categories of positive cultures.<!-- </div> --><!-- <div> -->3. While keeping in mind that this is a pilot study, there are some notable results from table 3, (a) no difference in treatment adequacy between clinical team's prescription and algorithmic recommendations, and (b) there were more escalations than "no change" and de-escalations combined. When considered together, it appears reasonable to infer that the recommended escalations were unnecessary and/or inappropriate. Of course, this might be a misinterpretation due to issues with data presentation as mentioned above. Nonetheless, a more analytical discussion of the results in this subgroup would be necessary in the revision.<!-- </div> --><!-- <div> -->========================<!-- </div> --><!-- <div> --></p><p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Apr 03 2023 11:59PM.
