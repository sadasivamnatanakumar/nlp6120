Conversely, inadequate breeding and genotyping without considering the potential for non-specific Cre-recombinase expression may lead to misinterpretations of results. Nestin-Cre transgenic mice, widely used for the selective deletion of genes in neurons, have been observed to have an incidence of Cre-line germline recombination. In this study, we attempted to generate neuron-specific Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (Glp1r) knock-out mice by crossing mice harboring the Nestin-Cre transgene with mice harboring the Glp1r gene modified with loxP insertion, in order to elucidate the role of Glp1r signaling in the nervous system. Surprisingly, during this breeding process, we discovered that the null allele emerged in the offspring irrespective of the presence or absence of the Nestin-Cre transgene, with a high probability of occurrence (93.6%). To elucidate the cause of this null allele, we conducted breeding experiments between mice carrying the heterozygous Glp1r null allele but lacking the Nestin-Cre transgene. We confirmed that the null allele was inherited by the offspring independently of the Nestin-Cre transgene. Furthermore, we assessed the gene expression, protein expression, and phenotype of mice carrying the homozygous Glp1r null allele generated from the aforementioned breeding, thereby confirming that the null allele indeed caused a global knock-out of Glp1r. These findings suggest that the null allele in the NestinCre-Glp1r floxed breeding arose due to germline recombination. Moreover, we demonstrated the possibility that germline recombination may occur not only during the spermatogenesis at testis but also during epididymal sperm maturation. The striking frequency of germline recombination in the Nestin-Cre driver underscores the necessity for caution when implementing precise breeding strategies and employing suitable genotyping methods.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

This methodology capitalizes on the functional properties of the bacteriophage P1 topoisomerase, Cre-recombinase, which specifically recognizes 34 base pair loxP sites [<xref rid="pone.0296006.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Cre-recombinase facilitates the deletion of DNA fragments that are flanked by a pair of loxP sites or flips DNA fragments between two inverted loxP sites. Breeding floxed mice (carrying the gene of interest flanked by loxP sites) with Cre mice (expressing Cre-recombinase driven by a cell-specific promoter) allows the generation of conditional knock-out or knock-in mice [<xref rid="pone.0296006.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296006.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Since its inception, a plethora of Cre drivers have been developed, and a diverse range of genetically targeted animal models have been utilized in biomedical research. Despite its widespread usage, this technique has faced criticism due to several reported issues and limitations, including Cre toxicity and unexpected recombination resulting from non-specific Cre activation [<xref rid="pone.0296006.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0296006.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Nestin is an intermediate neurofilament protein that was initially reported as a marker of neuroepithelial stem cells. Thus, Nestin-Cre transgenic mice are widely used for investigating the nervous system [<xref rid="pone.0296006.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296006.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (Glp1) is secreted from intestinal L-cells and the brain and functions through hormonal and neural pathways to regulate islet function, appetite, and gut motility [<xref rid="pone.0296006.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296006.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We attempted to generate neuron-specific Glp1r knock-out mice by breeding Nestin-Cre mice with Glp1r floxed mice to clarify the role of Glp1-Glp1r signaling in the nervous system. However, we observed unexpected genotyping results. Several reports have described similar phenomena in the Nestin-Cre line and revealed that it could be due to germline recombination [<xref rid="pone.0296006.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296006.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, the frequency of this phenomenon varied widely among reports, and the precise cause remains elusive.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrated that unexpected genotyping results observed when crossing Nestin-Cre mice with Glp1r floxed mice were caused by germline recombination, which occurred with a remarkably high frequency. Additionally, we identified the stages during gametogenesis where this recombination event takes place and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. These findings highlight the importance of being vigilant during breeding and genotyping, and the need to identify and address issues when using the Cre-loxP technique.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Genotyping methods and identification of offspring genotypes</title><p>Genotyping was performed through PCR analysis using genomic DNA (gDNA) extracted from tail biopsies. Two genotyping methods were employed to discriminate among Glp1r alleles: one for distinguishing the wild-type (wt) allele from the floxed allele and another for identifying the knock-out allele. To detect the wt allele and floxed allele, a primer set was designed to amplify the region flanking the 3&#x02019; loxP site, enabling the detection of the wt and floxed alleles (primer set 1) (<xref rid="pone.0296006.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Specifically, the wt allele yielded a 273 bp product, while the floxed allele produced a 416 bp product (<xref rid="pone.0296006.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). To detect the knock-out allele, another primer set was employed, targeting the entire floxed region (primer set 2) (<xref rid="pone.0296006.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). With primer set 2, the knockout allele was identified by a 423 bp product, while the wt allele and the floxed allele were identified in the vicinity of a 2000 bp product (<xref rid="pone.0296006.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). For the Nestin-Cre allele, we used the primer sets distinguishing the Cre positive allele (150 bp) and the Cre negative allele (246 bp). The identification of offspring genotypes was conducted by these three genotyping analyses (<xref rid="pone.0296006.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). To generate neuron-specific Glp1r knockout mice (NesCre-Glp1r fl/fl), we initially crossed NesCre-Glp1r wt/wt mice with Glp1r fl/fl mice, resulting in the generation of NesCre-Glp1r fl/wt mice (F1). Subsequently, we attempted to generate NesCre-Glp1r fl/fl mice by crossing NesCre-Glp1r fl/wt mice with Glp1r fl/fl mice (F2). According to Mendelian genetics, this mating scheme theoretically should have resulted in four distinct genotypes: NesCre-Glp1r fl/fl, NesCre-Glp1r fl/wt, Glp1r fl/fl, and Glp1r fl/wt mice. However, in our actual breeding experiments, in addition to these four genotypes, NesCre-Glp1r fl/- and Glp1r fl/- mice were also born (<xref rid="pone.0296006.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0296006.g001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0296006.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Genotyping strategy using tail samples for Glp1r wild-type allele, floxed allele, knock-out allele, and Nestin-Cre allele.</title><p>(A) Top line is the wild-type (wt) allele.

To investigate this matter, mice with the Glp1r fl/- genotype were crossed to determine if the knock-out allele could be inherited in the offspring. When Glp1r fl/- mice were bred together, the resulting offspring mice were classified into three genotypes (Glp1r fl/fl, Glp1r fl/-, Glp1r -/-) through genotyping, and their probabilities of occurrence approximately followed the principles of Mendelian genetics, with Glp1r fl/fl at 26.2%, Glp1r fl/- at 51.3%, and Glp1r -/- at 22.5% (<xref rid="pone.0296006.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). To ascertain whether the presence of knock-out alleles affects embryonic lethality and developmental abnormalities, we compared the differences in litter size, duration from mating to birth, and pre-weaning mortality between Glp1r fl/fl mice mating and Glp1r fl/- mice mating.

The Glp1r agonist, liraglutide, typically suppresses feeding upon injection. We observed a significant decrease in food intake in Glp1r fl/fl mice after liraglutide administration (Vehicle: -7.7%, Liraglutide: -57.6%), while food intake in Glp1r -/- mice was unaffected (Vehicle: -2.2%, Liraglutide: -1.6%) (<xref rid="pone.0296006.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (ipGTT) were performed to determine the effect of the Glp1-Glp1r axis on glucose control. Glucose levels at 0 minute did not differ significantly between Glp1r -/- and Glp1r fl/fl mice, but Glp1r -/- mice exhibited higher glucose levels at 15 minutes after glucose injection (<xref rid="pone.0296006.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). As Glp1 is one of the most potent stimulators of insulin gene expression and secretion, plasma insulin levels were measured during at 0, 15 and 30 minutes after glucose injection. Glp1r -/- mice exhibited higher insulin levels at 15 minutes after glucose injection compared to Glp1r fl/fl mice (<xref rid="pone.0296006.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3E</xref>).

However, there is considerable variability in the reported frequencies, and some studies have also reported gender differences [<xref rid="pone.0296006.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. To further investigate this phenomenon, we analyzed the number of offspring at the F2 generation with the knock-out allele and the floxed allele. Interestingly, we observed that when one parent carried the Nestin-Cre allele, the frequency of offspring with the knock-out allele was 45.9%, whereas the frequency of offspring with fl/fl genotype was only 3.1%. Consequently, the probability of the floxed allele undergoing germline recombination and being inherited as a knock-out allele in the offspring was 93.6% (<xref rid="pone.0296006.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>).

The high frequency of recombination suggests a possibility of underestimating the number of NesCre-Glp1r fl/fl offspring due to embryonic lethality.

Additionally, it is possible that the tail samples used for genotyping may have contained some neural tissue contamination. Therefore, we investigated the potential occurrence of somatic recombination in the tail due to unexpected Cre activity. We compared the expression levels of knock-out alleles in gDNA extracted from the tail of Glp1r fl/-, NesCre-Glp1r fl/wt, and Glp1r fl/wt mice using primer set 2 (<xref rid="pone.0296006.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). These primers exclusively amplified knock-out alleles since the PCR products from the floxed and wt alleles were too long to be amplified by this qPCR protocol. Additionally, because the primers targeted introns, only gDNA, not mRNA, could be amplified. While Glp1r fl/wt mice did not exhibit any presence of knock-out alleles, NesCre-Glp1r fl/wt mice showed a very low level of knock-out allele expression, approximately 1.5%, compared to Glp1r fl/- mice (<xref rid="pone.0296006.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>).

Next, to evaluate whether the genotyping results obtained from tail samples were influenced by somatic recombination, we conducted genotyping on blood samples.

However, the specific stage of gametogenesis at which genetic recombination occurs remains unknown. To elucidate this mechanism, we first examined the expression levels of <italic toggle="yes">Nestin</italic> mRNA in various reproductive organs using C57BL/6JJcl mice. In males, the expression level of <italic toggle="yes">Nestin</italic> mRNA relative to the brain was 2.8% in the testes, 24% in the caput epididymis, 5.9% in the corpus epididymis, 52% in the cauda epididymis, 6.3% in sperm collected from the caput epididymis, and 4.2% in sperm collected from the cauda epididymis (<xref rid="pone.0296006.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). Next, we collected sperm from the caput and cauda epididymis in NesCre-Glp1r fl/wt mice and compared the expression levels of knock-out alleles in sperm gDNA. In NestinCre-Glp1r fl/wt mice, knock-out alleles were almost undetectable in sperm collected from the caput epididymis. However, the expression levels of knock-out alleles in sperm from the cauda epididymis were comparable to those observed in sperm collected from the caput epididymis of Glp1r fl/- mice. Additionally, we did not observe any knock-out alleles in sperm obtained from the cauda epididymis of Glp1r fl/wt mice (<xref rid="pone.0296006.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>). In light of these results, we compared the gDNA expression levels of the knock-out allele in the spermatogenic cells within the testis, caput epididymal sperm, and cauda epididymal sperm of mice with all genotypes used in this experiment. In mice carrying the knock-out allele such as Glp1r fl/-, NesCre-Glp1r fl/-, and Glp1r -/-, the expression of knock-out allele was observed in testis, caput epididymal sperm, and cauda epididymal sperm to the same extent. Conversely, in mice lacking either Nestin-Cre or the floxed allele, such as Glp1r wt/wt, NesCre-Glp1r wt/wt, Glp1r fl/fl, and Glp1r fl/wt, the expression of knock-out allele was not detected in testis, caput epididymal sperm, and cauda epididymal sperm. However, in NesCre-Glp1r fl/fl mice and NesCre-Glp1r fl/wt mice, the expression of the knockout allele was higher in testis and cauda epididymal sperm than in caput epididymal sperm (<xref rid="pone.0296006.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>).

We generated Glp1r -/- mice, which were expected to have homozygous knock-out alleles based on genotyping, and confirmed that this knockout allele is inherited in offspring according to Mendelian genetics. We further confirmed the gene expression and protein expression of Glp1r and demonstrated that the knock-out allele truly reflects a global knockout throughout the body. Based on these findings, it is plausible to propose that the knock-out allele was caused by parental Cre activity at the gametogenesis.</p><p>Furthermore, we conducted functional evaluations to assess the effects of the Glp1r depletion in Glp1r -/- mice. There were no significant differences in body weight and food intake on a standard diet between Glp1r -/- and Glp1r fl/fl mice. However, Glp1r -/- mice exhibited impaired glucose tolerance during the ipGTT. These characteristics closely resemble those already reported in the global Glp1r knock-out mice [<xref rid="pone.0296006.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0296006.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. On the other hand, the originally intended neural-specific Glp1r knock-out mice showed no significant differences in body weight and food intake under standard feeding conditions, similar to the global Glp1r knock-out mice model. However, it has been reported that they do not exhibit impaired glucose tolerance during the ipGTT [<xref rid="pone.0296006.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296006.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Failure to accurately evaluate through genotyping can potentially lead to incorrect interpretations of such phenotypic differences.</p><p>Germline recombination occurs through genetic recombination mediated by Cre at some stage during gametogenesis. In the case of sperm, they are generated within the testes through spermatogenesis, acquire motility and fertility as they undergo epididymal maturation while passing through the epididymal duct, and are subsequently stored in the epididymal cauda until ejaculation [<xref rid="pone.0296006.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Genetic recombination mediated by Cre during any of these processes leads to germline recombination. The presence of Nestin in reproductive organs is a matter of debate. While some reports have identified Nestin expression in Leydig cells, seminiferous tubules, spermatocytes, and spermatogonia of the testis, other reports suggest its presence in vascular smooth muscle cells of the epididymis, which are involved in tissue remodeling and repair [<xref rid="pone.0296006.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296006.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296006.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. There are also various reports regarding the sites of Cre activity in the reproductive organs. Some investigators have observed Cre activity in the testis, whereas others have reported Cre expression in the epididymis [<xref rid="pone.0296006.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296006.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296006.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Conversely, James et al. reported a decline in Nestin expression in epididymal cells as individuals grow, with significantly reduced expression observed in adults [<xref rid="pone.0296006.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In our study, we detected <italic toggle="yes">Nestin</italic> mRNA expression in all male reproductive organs, with notably elevated expression levels in the cauda epididymis. Based on these results, we have noticed the possibility of germline recombination occurring in the epididymis. We examined the occurrence of knock-out alleles at different stages by collecting sperm from the caput and cauda epididymis and analyzing the relative expression levels of knock-out alleles in gDNA. In NesCre-Glp1r fl/wt mice, sperm collected from the cauda epididymis showed an increased expression of the knock-out allele compared to sperm collected from the caput epididymis. This pattern was similarly observed in NesCre-Glp1r fl/fl mice. On the other hand, we also compared the expression levels of the knock-out allele in spermatogenic cells obtained from the testis. While this evaluation comes with the limitation of encompassing various cell types, including germ cells such as spermatocytes and spermatozoa, as well as supporting cells like Sertoli cells, we observed comparable levels of knock-out allele expression in spermatogenic cells as seen in cauda epididymal sperm in both NesCre-Glp1r fl/wt and NesCre-Glp1r fl/fl mice. Consequently, our findings suggest that while the possibility of germline recombination occurring in the testis cannot be ruled out, there is a significant likelihood of Cre-mediated germline recombination during epididymal maturation and storage, especially when Nestin-Cre and the floxed allele are both present. Further investigation is needed to conclusively determine if sperm underwent germline recombination mediated by Cre enzyme expressed in the epididymis. In the case of females, we confirmed the expression of <italic toggle="yes">Nestin</italic> mRNA not only in the ovaries but also in small amounts in the oviduct and uterus, which is consistent with previous reports [<xref rid="pone.0296006.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, it was challenging to determine the specific stage of oocyte development where knock-out occurred due to technical limitations.</p><p>Germline recombination has been observed in various studies, but its frequency varies significantly. However, few studies have explored the reasons behind these disparities. In our investigation, we noticed an extremely high occurrence of germline recombination, particularly when the Cre-positive parent was female. Previous research and our experimental findings suggest that several factors contribute to the frequency variations. One such factor is the accessibility of loxP sites for Cre-recombination. A study involving NestinCre-Glp1r floxed mice reported unexpected genotyping events, where loxP sites were introduced on either side of exons 6 and 7 of the <italic toggle="yes">Glp1r</italic> gene. This resulted in nearly a 10% frequency when crossing male Cre-positive and female floxed mice, with an even higher frequency when the Cre-positive parent was female [<xref rid="pone.0296006.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. As both our study and theirs utilized the same Nestin-Cre mice, differences in the location of the loxP sites likely explain the discrepancies. Another factor to consider is the choice of target gene for knockout. It has been observed that germline recombination is more commonly observed when the target gene is related to ectoderm development, which plays a role in gametogenesis and early embryogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0296006.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Additionally, the level of target gene expression in reproductive organs may influence the sex bias in germline recombination. A previous study has shown that among analyzed Cre driver lines, 82.8% exhibited a sex bias, with 62.1% demonstrating germline recombination through the male parent and 20.1% through the female parent [<xref rid="pone.0296006.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Similarly, in the Nestin-Cre line, a high frequency of germline recombination was reported, with 86% of progeny from a male Cre-floxed parent and 100% from a female parent showing germline recombination [<xref rid="pone.0296006.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The frequency of germline recombination may also depend on whether the target gene is involved in embryological development. If global knockout of the gene leads to embryonic lethality or malformed progeny, mice with germline recombination are excluded, potentially underestimating the probability. Conversely, global knockout of the <italic toggle="yes">Glp1r</italic> gene has been shown to have no impact on embryological development and survival [<xref rid="pone.0296006.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, the probability of germline recombination calculated in our NestinCre-Glp1r floxed mouse model can be considered an accurate reflection of the true probability.</p><p>As mentioned above, in the context of Cre-loxP technology, there is a potential for germline recombination. Therefore, it is essential to identify knock-out alleles through genotyping. However, when the tissues used for genotyping themselves have the possibility of Cre enzyme expression, somatic recombination may also lead to the emergence of knock-out alleles. In such cases, it becomes necessary to establish a genotyping protocol that can distinguish between germline recombination and somatic recombination. In the tail gDNA used for genotyping in this study, qPCR revealed a slight expression of the knock-out allele in both the NesCre-Glp1r fl/fl and NesCre-Glp1r fl/wt genotypes. In contrast, blood gDNA from NesCre-Glp1r fl/fl and NesCre-Glp1r fl/wt mice did not show this expression. This result, likely due to the presence of neurons in the tail, reflects the existence of somatic recombination induced by Nestin-Cre in tail tissues. In previous studies, a method for distinguishing between somatic and germline recombination involved confirming the gene expression levels of the recombination allele through qPCR and establishing cutoff values to differentiate between somatic and germline recombination [<xref rid="pone.0296006.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. When conducting genotyping in tissues where Cre promoter gene expression is expected, it is crucial to carefully configure the protocol of genotyping or consider alternative tissues.</p><p>While there is abundant literature on conditional knock-out mice created using Cre-loxP technology, there is a scarcity of information that addresses the awareness and preventive measures of unexpected recombination. The occurrence of unexpected recombination is influenced by various factors, and simply confirming the expression of Cre promoter in gene databases does not negate the possibility of such recombination events. Therefore, it is crucial to have a comprehensive understanding of these potential risks and corresponding solutions when utilizing this technology in experimental settings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec010"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have found that Nestin-Cre mice crossed with Glp1r floxed mice exhibit unexpected germline recombination with remarkable efficiency.

Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit lgG (1:20000 Santa Cruz, USA). The results were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL<sup>&#x02122;</sup> prime, Amersham, UK). Densitometric analysis was conducted using ImageJ software (NIH, USA).</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Metabolic and biochemical studies</title><p>For metabolic and biochemical studies, we used only male mice. Body weights were monitored once a week from 10 weeks to 20 weeks. Food intake was individually measured for 3 consecutive days at 11 weeks using the mouse feeder MF-4S (Shin Factory, Japan). Blood glucose and serum insulin levels were measured with Stat Strip XP3 (Nipro, Japan) and ELISA (Morinaga Institute of Biological Science, Japan), respectively. For intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (ipGTT), mice were fasted for 16 h with free access to water followed by intraperitoneal glucose injection (1.5 g/kg). We measured blood glucose at 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after glucose injection, and serum insulin at 0, 15, and 30 min after glucose injection. To investigate the effects of Glp1r signaling on anorectic responses, mice received liraglutide (Novo Nordisk; 1 mg/kg) or saline (10 ml/kg) 1 hour prior to the dark cycle, and food consumption was measured after 24 hours using the mouse feeder MF-4S.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard error of the mean (SEM). The statistical significance was analyzed by Student&#x02019;s t-test, or two-way repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni corrected Student&#x02019;s t-test, or one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey&#x02019;s honestly significant difference (HSD) test for multiple comparisons. P-value &#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

However, the authors discovered that the null allele was present with or without Nestin-cre expression in tail DNA, suggesting the occurrence of germline recombination. The authors found that germline recombination occurs during the process of epididymal maturation in male mice.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>Authors should show the Cre-genotyping results, and indicate Cre+ or - genotype, for the samples genotyped for Glp1r in Fig. 1D.</p><p>The authors should label lane 1 and 2 in Fig. 1D.</p><p>Is the nestin promoter expressed in various tissues tested in Fig. 2B?</p><p>The western blots in Fig. 2C should be quantified as a Glp1r band is observable in Glp1r-/- lanes. A darker, non-adjusted exposure should be shown for the stomach blots. Molecular weight markers are missing.</p><p>Line 146-148; from this statement, it is unclear whether fasting blood glucose or blood glucose levels are shown in Fig. 3D.</p><p>How do the results shown in Fig. 3F of the HOMA-IR and HOMA-b tests compare to full-body Glp1r KO animals?</p><p>Examples of genotyping results (as done in Fig. 1) would be complementary to diagrams shown in Fig. 4.</p><p>Could the authors indicate the genotyping strategy employed in Fig. 4 to detect the floxed allele (ie primer set 1 vs 2). The authors previously indicated difficulty in detection of the floxed vs WT allele using primer set 2 (Fig.1). This technical issue may prevent accurate results in determining the frequency of recombination, depending on the genotyping strategy employed in Fig. 4. Was Cre genotype established?</p><p>Fig. 5C; the results in Fig. 1 indicate that knockout alleles were genotyped for to determine the identification of fl/- mice. Please clarify further.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;The manuscript written by Kajtani et. al. describes the generation of mice with KO of the Glp1r gene irrespective of the presence of Cre recombinase. They also found that the KO trait was a global event. Initially, they breed the mice with nestin Cre background that should generate a neuron specific KO trait. But they found the generation of a nonspecific global KO trait of the Glp1r gene. Their further investigation found that the KO event was a result of germ-line recombination.</p><p>The manuscript is well written without the use of unnecessary jargon.</p><p>The manuscript points out important phenomena of which the researchers of this field should be well aware.</p><p>1. The authors should have performed genotyping from gDNA isolated from blood rather than tail samples as there are chances of getting false positives during detection due to possible expression of nestin-cre in the tail region. The blood data will represent a more global perspective in this regard.</p><p>2. The caudal part of the epididymis serves as a reservoir of total sperm pool where all the knockout allele carrying spermatozoa will be present in abundance and will be comparable with the number of spermatozoa present in the caput region. So, the statement mentioned in lines 211-215 needs to be further strengthened by other experiments. Rather the author should focus more on the spermatogenic cells where most of the recombination steps are known to occur.</p><p>3. The author should explain the mating schematics and results and methods in a more understandable manner.</p><p>4. In the discussion in the lines 263-267 the authors are trying to state that in nestin Cre-Glp1rfloxed mice they observed germline recombination where as they have to be clear whether the event was observed in nestin Cre-Glp1r fl/fl or nestin Cre-Glp1r fl/f- mice as in case of nestin Cre-Glp1r fl/f- mice due to genetic recombination and meiosis it is possible to get Glp1r knockout allele. They also have to experimentally validate this phenomenon using nestin Cre-Glp1r fl/fl mice also.</p><p>5. To prove the claim that the recombnatio event occur in the epididymis needs further investigation.</p><p>**********</p><p><!-- <font color="black"> -->6.
