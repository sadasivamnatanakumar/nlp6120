The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) CC chemokine pUL128 has a dual role in the infection cycle. On one hand, it forms the pentameric receptor-binding complex gHgLpUL(128,130,131A), which is crucial for the broad cell tropism of HCMV. On the other hand, it is an active chemokine that attracts leukocytes and shapes their activation. All animal CMVs studied so far have functionally homologous CC chemokines. In murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), the CC chemokine is encoded by the m131/m129 reading frames. The MCMV CC chemokine is called MCK2 and forms a trimeric gHgLMCK2 entry complex. Here, we have generated MCK2 mutant viruses either unable to form gHgLMCK2 complexes, lacking the chemokine function or lacking both functions. By using these viruses, we could demonstrate that gHgLMCK2-dependent entry and MCK2 chemokine activity are independent functions of MCK2 <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. The gHgLMCK2 complex promotes the tropism for leukocytes like macrophages and dendritic cells and secures high titers in salivary glands in MCMV-infected mice independent of the chemokine activity of MCK2. In contrast, reduced early antiviral T cell responses in MCMV-infected mice are dependent on MCK2 being an active chemokine and do not require the formation of gHgLMCK2 complexes. High levels of CCL2 and IFN-&#x003b3; in spleens of infected mice and MCMV virulence depend on both, the formation of gHgLMCK2 complexes and the MCK2 chemokine activity. Thus, independent and concerted functions of MCK2 serving as chemokine and part of a gHgL entry complex shape antiviral immunity and virus dissemination.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Studies on immunomodulatory proteins of herpesviruses have strongly contributed to understanding antiviral immune responses elicited during infection and to defining targets for intervention during herpesvirus infections. CC chemokines of cytomegaloviruses have been shown to shape the viral cell tropism and antiviral immune responses, yet, their modes of action are not really understood. Here, we used well-defined mutants of the MCMV chemokine MCK2 to exemplarily dissect the role of a CMV CC chemokine in viral dissemination and antiviral innate and adaptive immune responses. We could show that the chemokine activity and the entry function of MCK2 are independent players in the MCMV infection of the mouse. As cytomegaloviruses are discussed as potential vaccine vectors which may be programmed to elicit specific CD8+ T cell responses and combat specific pathogens, it is important to understand the contribution of immunomodulatory proteins to vector-induced immune responses. Specifically, in infections of Rhesus macaques with Rhesus CMV (RhCMV), the viral CC chemokine has been shown to drastically shape the immune response to vaccine antigens. Our detailed analysis of the dual roles of a CMV CC chemokine may further help to decide whether CMV vaccine vectors should express an intact viral CC chemokine or not.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

Like all herpesviruses, HCMV is highly adapted to its host and uses a variety of envelope proteins determining attachment, receptor recognition and fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Additionally, it expresses many immunomodulatory genes including chemokines [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The HCMV CC chemokine-like UL128-encoded protein has been shown to play a dual role in infection. As a viral chemokine, pUL128 shapes monocyte activation [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As an essential component of the pentameric gHgLpUL(128,130,131A) entry complex, pUL128 contributes to the broad viral cell tropism of HCMV and promotes infection of numerous cell types, including monocytes and dendritic cells [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Alongside with an alternative trimeric gHgLgO entry complex, the pentameric complex shapes the cell tropism of HCMV and additionally offers a way to navigate HCMV through the infected host [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. While studies of HCMV infections in cell culture contributed to the understanding of monocyte infection or monocyte activation, <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> models cannot fully recapitulate the roles of monocyte infection and activation during HCMV infection <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. This can only be addressed in an animal model. Functional homologs of pUL128 have been identified for a number of animal cytomegaloviruses including murine CMV (MCMV) and rat CMV (RCMV) [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The most extensively investigated homolog is the MCK2 protein found in MCMV, which arises from a splicing event that combines the MCMV open reading frames (ORFs) m131 and m129 [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Like pUL128 of HCMV, MCK2&#x02019;s amino acid sequence shows a cysteine pattern characteristic for CC (&#x000df;)- chemokines and exhibits functional characteristics of a chemokine as induction of calcium signaling in PEC <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and recruitment of myeloid progenitor cells and induction of inflammation <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Similar to HCMV, MCMV virions also contain two alternative gHgL entry complexes, gHgLgO and gHgLMCK2. The latter is a functional homolog of the HCMV gHgLpUL(128,130,131A) pentameric complex and determines the tropism of MCMV for macrophages <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

How the MCK2 chemokine activity or the gHgLMCK2 complex contribute to the observed differences in salivary gland infection and antiviral defense is not understood. Moreover, it is also not known whether the chemokine exerts its activity through the same receptor(s) through which gHgLMCK2-dependent entry is promoted or through different receptors.</p><p>Here, we could for the first time show that gHgLMCK2-dependent cell tropism and MCK2 chemokine activity are independent functions of MCK2. We constructed MCMV mutants that either lacked the ability to form a gHgLMCK2 complex but expressed an active chemokine or vice versa. By using these mutants, we could show that infection of monocytes and salivary gland titers are dependent on the gHgLMCK2 complex. In contrast, the reduced early antiviral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response was controlled by the chemokine activity of MCK2. Efficient induction of cytokines like interferons and CCL2 is not possible if either of the MCK2 functions is lost and MCMV virulence also seems to be shaped both by the chemokine and the gHgLMCK2 complex.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>MCMV MCK2 mutants for discriminating MCK2&#x02019;s chemokine activity from gHgLMCK2-dependent virus entry</title><p>To study the role of the MCK2 protein of MCMV <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>, predominantly MCMV mutants lacking the complete MCK2 protein were used in previous studies [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To determine whether the chemokine activity of MCK2 and entry promoted by the gHgLMCK2 complex are independent functions of MCK2, we cloned MCMV mutants, which were either chemokine-negative but complex-positive, or chemokine-positive but complex-negative or chemokine-negative and complex-negative. All MCK2 mutations were introduced into the genomic background of the BAC-cloned Smith strain of MCMV (pSM3fr-MCK2fl, here called wt MCMV) [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] (<xref rid="ppat.1011793.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). The MCK2 C1 mutant carries a point mutation resulting in a cysteine<sup>27</sup> to glycine<sup>27</sup> exchange and therefore cannot form the C1-C3 disulfide bridge characteristic for CC chemokines. Therefore, C1 MCK2 should no longer be an active chemokine but may still be able to form a complex with gHgL. The 129stop mutant carries a stop cassette, which interrupts the 129 ORF [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] resulting in a truncated MCK2 protein. This mutation is identical to the MCK2 mutation found in a BAC cloned Smith strain of MCMV [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The 131stop mutant carries stop mutations that interrupt the 131 ORF [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and therefore does not express an MCK2 protein. In Western blot (WB) analysis, C1 MCMV showed the typical MCK2 WB pattern of multiple bands which is characteristic for the wt MCK2 protein [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] (<xref rid="ppat.1011793.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). 129stop MCMV expressed a truncated MCK2 protein and 131stop MCMV expressed no MCK2 protein (<xref rid="ppat.1011793.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). Wt and C1 MCK2, but not the truncated 129stop MCK2 were integrated into virions (<xref rid="ppat.1011793.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>, left panel) and both, wt and C1 MCK2 formed the previously described gHgLMCK2 complex (<xref rid="ppat.1011793.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>, right panel) [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Interestingly, MCK2 with cysteines C27 and C28 respectively exchanged for arginine and glycine (C1C2 mutation) [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], showed a different pattern in the WB (<xref rid="ppat.1011793.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>, left panel) and was not incorporated into virions (<xref rid="ppat.1011793.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>, right panel). This indicated that disrupting both disulfide bridges in MCK2 results in a mutant protein unable to form an envelope gHgLMCK2 complex. When we studied growth in primary fibroblast cultures, we observed a grouping of MCK2 mutants. Mutants 129stop, 131stop and C1C2, which are not able to form gHgLMCK2 complexes, showed elevated titers of supernatant virus when compared to wt or C1 MCMV (<xref rid="ppat.1011793.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>). The differences between the viruses were too low to reach statistical significance, but the grouping of the gHgLMCK2-positive and -negative viruses was striking. For HCMV, it has been described that the gHgLpUL(128,130,131A) complex impedes release of newly produced virus from infected cells resulting in lower titers of supernatant virus in cell culture when compared to infections with pentamer-negative HCMV [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

Interestingly, although knockout of the CC chemokine shows pronounced differences in the <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> cell tropism, differences in <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> organ titers affected predominantly viral titers in salivary glands and the extent of macrophage and monocyte infection in different organs [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Additionally, MCK2 knockout mutants of MCMV showed pleiotropic changes in antiviral immune responses [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Most of the studies compared wt MCMV with mutant MCMV lacking the complete MCK2. Therefore, it was not understood whether specific changes in antiviral immune responses are due to the loss of the MCK2 chemokine activity attracting and shaping inflammatory and immune regulatory cells, or due to a reduced gHgLMCK2-dependent infection of monocytes which may result in the reprogramming of the infected cells [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It was also not clear whether MCK2 functions could be dissected to the effect that their contributions to MCK2-dependent modulations of antiviral immune responses can be understood.</p><p>To address these questions, the major prerequisite was to design MCK2 mutants that specifically lose the chemokine activity (C1 MCMV), the gHgLMCK2-dependent entry activity (129 stop MCMV) or both (131stop MCMV) and study their phenotypes <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. The 131stop mutant does not express MCK2. The 129stop mutant carries a stop cassette in the m129 ORF and has an impaired ability to infect macrophages [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Similar mutants which resulted from cell culture passage of MCMV showed an impaired macrophage tropism also <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Here, we showed that the m129stop mutant expresses a truncated MCK2 protein in infected cells which is not integrated in a gHgLMCK2 complex, but has wt-like chemokine activity. For designing an MCK2 mutant which expresses an inactive chemokine, but is still able to form a functional gHgLMCK2 entry complex, a detailed <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> analysis of the protein and the gHgLMCK2 complex formation was necessary to ensure that mutation of one or more of the 4 cysteines, which define the cc chemokine structure, abolished only the chemokine activity but not gHgLMCK2 complex formation. The C1 mutant which eliminated the C1-C3 disulfide bridge fulfilled these criteria. C1 MCK2 was an inactive chemokine but still formed a virion gHgLMCK2 complex and showed wt-like growth properties in cell culture.</p><p>When analyzing infection of macrophages and dendritic cells <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>, we could confirm that MCK2 mutants unable to form the gHgLMCK2 complex show an impaired capability to infect macrophages and, what was new, that this goes hand in hand with an impaired capability to infect dendritic cells. Notably, the C1 mutant exhibited a J774 cell-specific reduction in infection capacity, which however was much weaker than the pronounced impairments shown by the gHgLMCK2-negative 129stop and 131stop mutants. This might reflect that gHgLMCK2 complexes of C1 MCMV exhibit minor structural changes which may impair the interaction of gHgLMCK2 with its receptor, but only become apparent if cell types are highly dependent on gHgLMCK2-driven entry like J774 cells. Impaired infection of both, macrophages and dendritic cells, has also been described for pentamer-negative HCMV [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Dendritic cells have been reported to promote the dissemination of MCMV within the infected mouse [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Additionally, CD11c-positive myeloid cells have been described to transfer MCMV to salivary gland acinar cells [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A reduced capability of gHgLMCK2-negative MCMV to infect these monocytes may be one explanation for reduced titers in salivary glands. Our findings, that salivary gland titers are reduced in infections with 129stop and 131stop MCMV but not in infections with C1 MCMV, point in that direction. Thus, gHgLMCK2-dependent tropism for dendritic cells colonizing salivary glands may indeed contribute to efficient infection of salivary glands. We have shown before that MCK2-dependent differences in salivary gland titers at day 14 p.i. are dependent on the route of infection and disappear when mice are infected intravenously [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This strengthens findings that a tissue resident migrating cell type promotes dissemination to salivary glands [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], a route which can be bypassed when mice are infected intravenously.</p><p>Strongly reduced titers in salivary glands are a solid phenotype of infections with gHgLMCK2-negative MCMV. In contrast, observations of reduced titers after infection with MCK2-negative MCMV in spleen, liver, lungs and blood were not consistent, minor and dependent on the route of infection, the dose of infection and the mouse or virus strains used [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Very likely, MCK2-dependent differences in organ titers can only be clearly revealed in detailed time courses and will vary with each experimental setting. This is probably also true for infection of PBLs. By analyzing PBLs using either an <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> reactivation assay on fibroblasts or by determining viral DNA loads in PBLs, we observed no differences between infections with wt and MCK2 mutants of MCMV in Balb/c mice 4 days after i.p. infection, whereas Saederup et al. [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] found reduced numbers of infected PBLs for MCK2-negative MCMV using the same infection route.</p><p>Organ titers are not only shaped by cells spreading infection to specific organs, but also by local immune responses. For MCK2 knockout mutants, elevated early IE1-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses have been described for the spleen [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] which suggested that MCK2 can suppress the early antiviral T cell response and may this way facilitate virus replication in organs. In our hands, infections with 131stop and C1 mutants showed enhanced early anti-IE CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses which suggests that the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response is suppressed by the active MCK2 chemokine. This supports the hypothesis of Daley-Bauer et al. [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], who postulated that MCK2 attracts inflammatory monocytes which then suppress CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation. Interestingly, the 129stop mutant showed an even stronger suppression of the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response than wt MCMV. One hypothesis to explain this finding may be that MCK2 chemokine not complexed with gHgL is more active. Another hypothesis may be that the presence of an active chemokine and the parallel reduced capability of the 129stop mutant to infect monocytes may result in a more pronounced inflammatory monocyte response.</p><p>RhCMV vaccine vectors targeting SIV and lacking the RhCMV CC chemokine elicit unconventional CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses in immunized mice when compared to RhCMV vaccine vectors expressing the CC chemokine [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The unconventional CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response resulted in a profound early control of the SIV infection [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. These findings have started intense research on tailored CMV vectors for vaccination [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Here, we studied quantitative differences in early CD8+ T cells responses targeting the IE1 protein of MCMV. We did not address whether the antiviral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response also is qualitatively changed when MCK2 is mutated. However, immunizations of mice with MCMV vaccine vectors expressing MCK2 mutations would be an interesting model to address the role of CMV CC chemokines in vaccination.</p><p>Wikstrom et al. [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] showed reduced levels of IFNs and the inflammatory chemokine CCL2 in spleens of mice infected with MCK2-negative MCMV. We observed that IFN-&#x003b3; and CCL2 levels were decreased for all MCK2 mutants. This suggests that for high level cytokine/chemokine production after infection, both, an active chemokine and the capability to efficiently infect the same target cells as wt MCMV, are needed. The reductions of the cytokine/chemokine levels were comparable for all mutants.</p><p>Deletion of MCK2 and the functional homolog GP129 of GPCMV have been shown to result in less virulent viruses when mice were infected with equal numbers of infectious particles [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This may also explain why salivary gland-derived stocks of MCMV, which are homogenously MCK2-positive [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], exhibit enhanced virulence when compared to tissue culture-derived virus stocks. Weight loss after MCMV infection is one symptom of virus virulence. Here, we found that in contrast to wt, C1 or 129stop MCMV-infected mice, only 131stop MCMV-infected mice gained weight irrespective of infection. This suggests that MCK2-dependent virulence is shaped by both functions of MCK2.</p><p>Propagating MCMV in cell culture bears the risk to select for MCK2-inactivating mutations [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, when using cell culture-derived virus, ORF m131 and m129 sequences should be controlled to avoid uncontrolled modulation of antiviral immune responses. A prominent example are studies using MCMV derived from reconstitution of BAC pSM3fr [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] that carries a fixed mutation in ORF m129 which corresponds to our 129stop mutant. Antiviral immune responses elicited by the pSM3fr-derived virus will thus be like responses elicited by the 129stop mutant and not like responses elicited by wt MCMV.</p><p>In summary, our study is the first to demonstrate that the MCK2 chemokine and the gHgLMCK2 complex have distinct functions which can act independently or in a concerted manner. This creates a completely new basis to understand the roles of MCK2 in the MCMV infection. Additionally, studies on CMV immune responses with laboratory strains lacking the chemokine or carrying specific mutants can now retrospectively be re-evaluated. For future studies and for example CMV vaccine vector design, it has to be taken into account that, as has been shown for RhCMV vectors [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], the interplay between the CC chemokine and other immune modulatory genes of a specific virus strain or vector backbone may additionally shape the CC chemokine-dependent immune modulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Animal research protocols were approved by the ethics committee of the Regierung von Oberbayern, permission no.55.2-1-54-2532-78-2015, according to German Federal Law &#x000a7;8 Abs. 1 TierSchG (animal protection law).</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Mice and infections</title><p>BALB/c mice (bred by Janvier-Labs, France) were maintained under SPF conditions at the animal facility of the Max von Pettenkofer-Institute, LMU Munich, Germany. 6&#x02013;8 weeks old female BALB/c mice were infected i.p. with tissue culture (NIH3T3)-derived wt MCMV or MCMV mutants in 150 &#x003bc;l of PBS.

An infectious center assay was performed to determine the number of infected leukocytes in blood. Briefly, 4 days p.i., peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) were prepared from non-coagulated blood, counted, added to sub-confluent MEF monolayers in 12 well plates and overlayed with carboxymethyl cellulose. Three days later, the numbers of plaques were counted. For quantitation of viral DNA in PBLs, DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen). Then, viral genomes were quantitated by MCMV M55 (encoding gB)&#x02014;specific qPCR normalized to cell numbers by pthrp specific qPCR [<xref rid="ppat.1011793.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].
