Reserpine is known to act centrally as well as peripherally by depletion of biogenic amines like noradrenaline, dopamine and serotonin. Mostly, its peripheral depletion of amines is responsible for its antihypertensive effect while its central depletion of amines is responsible for its antipsychotic action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, because of its central action it produces sedation and Parkinsonism when used for the management of hypertension for prolonged periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. As a result it has reduced usage for chronic treatment in hypertensive patients and its use is limited to selective patient population only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Hence there is a need for structural modification of the drug to make it more acceptable therapeutically for the treatment of hypertension.</p><p>Attempts were made in the past to synthesize derivatives of reserpine with possibly higher and/or modified activities or with fewer side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Compared to reserpine itself, a number of reserpine analogues were found to exert a stronger influence on the amine concentration in the periphery than in brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Based on the poor ability of quaternary compounds to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, a great deal of research has been devoted towards quaternization of existing drugs to achieve preferential peripheral action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Earlier reports have demonstrated the synthesis of quaternary derivatives of reserpine and isoreserpine, however their pharmacology was not studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Previous studies by our group also revealed that reserpine methiodide produced selective depletion of peripheral biogenic amines without affecting their central stores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In the present investigation, a quaternary analogue of reserpine <italic>viz</italic>., reserpine methonitrate (RMN), which was synthesized in our laboratory was evaluated in rats for its amine depleting actions compared to reserpine. For this, the urinary levels of vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) which are the respective metabolites of noradrenaline, serotonin and dopamine were estimated after reserpine or RMN treatment in rats. The change in the blood pressure response of anaesthetized rats after treatment with RMN was also evaluated in comparison to reserpine.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Biochemical estimations</title><p>The main aim of the study was to determine whether RMN was able to deplete the central and peipheral biogenic amines to the same extent as produced by reserpine. Reserpine at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight produced significant increase in the urinary excretion profile of VMA compared to control animals. The analogue at doses equimolar to reserpine of 5 and 10 mg/kg body weight produced more significant increase in VMA excretion compared to controls and that observed with reserpine (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). However, the higher dose (10 mg/kg body weight) of RMN did not further enhance the excretion of VMA produced by 5 mg/kg body weight dose.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Diagram illustrating the effect of reserpine and reserpine methonitrate on the 24 h urinary excretion of VMA in rats. </bold>Each bar indicates the mean excretion of six animals.

It has been well established that the antihypertensive and tranquilizing actions of reserpine are mediated through the depletion of biogenic amines in the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The peripheral depletion of amines is responsible for its antihypertensive effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] while their central depletion plays a role in sedation and depression of reserpine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Reserpine exerts its depleting effect by specifically inhibiting the adenosine triphosphate-Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent incorporation of biogenic amines into their storage vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>Since reserpine depletes noradrenaline, 5-HT and dopamine from their storage sites, this results in a consequent increase in their metabolite levels in urine. Previous investigators have demonstrated a marked increase in the urinary excretion of peripheral and central metabolites of biogenic amines in animals treated with reserpine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>In the present investigation, a non-invasive biochemical approach was followed to determine the 24 h urinary excretion of VMA, 5-HIAA and HVA in rats treated with reserpine or RMN. Moreover, VMA, the peripheral metabolite of noradrenaline; 5-HIAA, the main metabolite of serotonin; and HVA, the predominant metabolite of dopamine were selected as the biomarkers for evaluation since noradrenaline exists both centrally and peripherally, serotonin exists mainly peripherally while majority of dopamine exists centrally. Since 99% of the total body's content of serotonin is present in the periphery, it is considered that the major part of the excreted 5-HIAA is from the peripheral release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Similarly, high levels of dopamine are found in the centre rather than periphery, and any change in the HVA excretion in urine was considered as a corresponding change in dopamine levels at the central regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. These indices provide an indirect evidence for the peripheral and central monoamine depleting effects of reserpine and its quaternary analogue.</p><p>The results showed that reserpine increased the urinary excretion of VMA, 5-HIAA and HVA indicating the depletion of peripheral as well as central biogenic amines. These are in agreement with the results observed by previous investigators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The increase in the urinary excretion of VMA and 5-HIAA with RMN is higher than with reserpine at equimolar dose of 5 mg/kg body weight. The localized distribution of the analogue in the periphery could led to higher level of depletion of peripheral noradrenaline and serotonin hence their metabolite levels were found to be increased much more which also substantiate our previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The inability of the analogue to increase HVA excretion unlike reserpine could be due to its non-entry across the blood-brain barrier and into the central nervous system to deplete dopamine which is present predominantly in mesolimbic, nigrostriatal and tuberoinfendibular systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p><p>The increased urinary levels of 5-HIAA observed with RMN could be due to the peripheral release of 5-HT as it is found predominantly at the periphery in enterochromaffin cells. The higher dose (10 mg/kg) of RMN did not produce any further increase in the VMA and 5-HIAA excretion compared to lower dose. The possible reason for this effect could be that 5 mg/kg dose was sufficient to deplete the amines completely from the storage sites.</p><p>In order to evaluate whether the quaternary analogue of reserpine (RMN) still retains the peripheral blood pressure lowering activity, further experiments were carried out on the blood pressure of anaesthetized rats. Thus far, the results of RMN on the blood pressure response of anaesthetized rats confirmed that the peripheral actions of reserpine molecule are not affected by quaternization. However, in the present study the vehicle (DMSO) also produced minor hypotensive effect on blood pressure of rats when administered alone with the dose used for the administration of the drugs. Earlier workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] also reported hypotension with DMSO supporting the present observations. Reserpine produced dose dependent reduction in blood pressure as demonstrated by previous investigators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. As indicated in earlier reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] the hypotensive effect of reserpine observed in rats is due to the depletion of catecholamines from the peripheral stores.</p><p>The effect of equimolar doses of RMN also indicated hypotension however, with higher doses compared to reserpine. It is further indicated that quaternization of reserpine not only restricted the entry of RMN to central nervous system but also reduced to the target tissue in the periphery. Hence relatively higher doses were required to produce reserpine like effect. Mechanistically, the hypotensive actions of RMN could also be due to peripheral depletion of catecholamines as evident from the positive correlation with the results of previous section on the peripheral depletion of monoamines.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the present study indicated that the quaternization of reserpine molecule prevents its access into the central nervous system and thereby produces selective peripheral depletion of biogenic amines. Furthermore, the study indicated that quaternization of reserpine had not abolished the hypotensive response but only higher doses were required.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Chemistry</title><p>The synthesis of RMN was done as follows: The solution of reserpine (2 g, 3.3 mmols) in dichloromethane (20 ml) was added to methyl iodide (11 ml, 176 mmols) and the resulting mixture was kept for two days in dark. The solid was filtered and washed with a little cold dichloromethane and dried under vacuum at 70&#x000b0;C for 2 h to yield reserpine methiodide (RMI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Then, to a solution of RMI (0.25 gm, 0.67 mmols) in a mixture of dichloromethane (3 ml) and aqueous ethanol (90%, 2 ml) was added a solution of silver nitrate (56 mg, 0.67 mmols) in aqueous ethanol (90%, 2 ml). The reaction mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. The solution was filtered and washed thoroughly with chloroform : methanol (1:1). The solid obtained after evaporation of the solvent was passed through a silica gel column and eluted with chloroform : methanol (80:20) to yield RMN, m.p. 292&#x02013;294&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Chemicals used</title><p>Reserpine and thiopentone were generous gift samples from Novartis India Limited and Abbott Laboratories, Mumbai respectively.

The supernatants were transferred into another set of clean and dry tubes and stored at -20&#x000b0;C until analysis by HPLC.</p></sec><sec><title>Simultaneous HPLC determination of VMA, 5-HIAA and HVA in urine</title><p>The procedure described by Wako-chem. Co.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] was used for the simultaneous determination of the above metabolites. The urine samples were thawed before analysis. To 0.2 ml of each sample, 0.1 ml of internal standard (iso-VMA, 1000 &#x003b7;g) and 0.7 ml of mobile phase were added. The solutions were mixed well and filtered through 0.4 &#x003bc;m membrane filter. The filtrate (20 &#x003bc;L) was injected into the column (RP C-18, 250 mm &#x000d7; 4.6 mm I.D; particle size 5 &#x003bc;m; YMC Inc., USA). The mobile phase (filtered through 0.4 &#x003bc;m membrane filter) comprised of 10:90 v/v of acetonitrile and 0.1 <italic>M </italic>KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>and the flow rate of the mobile phase was maintained at 0.8 ml/min, which yields a column back pressure of 220&#x02013;230 kgf/cm<sup>2</sup>. Detection was done by UV absorption at 230 &#x003b7;m. The range of the detector was set at 0.001 a.u.f.s. The peak area ratios of VMA, 5-HIAA and HVA to that of internal standard were calculated and substituted in the respective regression equations to estimate the amount of the metabolite present in the sample.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect on normal blood pressure of anaesthetized rats</title><p>The procedure described by Noble [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>] was followed to evaluate the effect of RMN on normal blood pressure of anaesthetized rats in comparison with reserpine. Groups of rats of six each were anaesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of thiopentone (40 mg/kg body weight). The femoral vein was cannulated for administration of supplementary doses of anaesthetic (if required) and drug solutions.</p><p>Haemodynamic setup was used to record the blood pressure of rats. The blood pressure of each animal was recorded from left common carotid artery connected to a mercury manometer on kymograph paper. The normal blood pressure of rats was recorded after stabilization for 30 minutes. The different doses of reserpine (0.25, 0.50, 1, 5, 10 and 15 &#x003bc;g/kg body weight) or RMN (10, 25 and 50 &#x003bc;g/kg body weight) were studied in separate groups (n = 6) to determine the change in blood pressure response.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard error of means. Statistical analysis was done using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Post-hoc comparisons were done by using Dunnet's <italic>t</italic>-test. In all the cases, p &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abreviations</title><p>RMN: Reserpine methonitrate</p><p>VMA: Vanillylmandelic acid</p><p>5-HIAA: 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid</p><p>HVA: Homovanillic acid</p><p>DMSO: Dimethyl sulfoxide</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SN made significant contribution in designing the studies, conducting the experiments, interpretation of the data, conceptualization of statistical analyses and drafting the final manuscript.
