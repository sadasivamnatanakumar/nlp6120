Studies have suggested that memorability is an intrinsic, continuous property of a visual stimulus that can be both measured and manipulated. Memory literature suggests that important developmental changes occur throughout adolescence that have an impact on recognition memory, yet the effect that these changes have on image memorability has not yet been investigated. In the current study, we recruited adolescents ages 11&#x02013;18 (n = 273, mean = 16) to an online visual memory experiment to explore the effects of developmental changes throughout adolescence on image memorability, and determine if memorability findings in adults can be generalized to the adolescent age group. We used the online experiment to calculate adolescent memorability scores for 1,000 natural images, and compared the results to the MemCat dataset&#x02014;a memorability dataset that is annotated with adult memorability scores (ages 19&#x02013;27). Our study finds that memorability scores in adolescents and adults are strongly and significantly correlated (Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation, <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.76, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). This correlation persists even when comparing adults with developmentally different sub-groups of adolescents (ages 11&#x02013;14: <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.67, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001; ages 15&#x02013;18: <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.60, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Moreover, the rankings of image categories by mean memorability scores were identical in both adolescents and adults (including the adolescent sub-groups), indicating that broadly, certain image categories are more memorable for both adolescents and adults. Interestingly, however, adolescents experienced significantly higher false alarm rates than adults, supporting studies that show increased impulsivity and reward-seeking behaviour in adolescents. Our results reveal that the memorability of images remains consistent across individuals at different stages of development. This consistency aligns with and strengthens prior research, indicating that memorability is an intrinsic property of images. Our findings open new pathways for applying memorability studies in adolescent populations, with profound implications in fields such as education, marketing, and psychology. Our work paves the way for innovative approaches in these domains, leveraging the consistent nature of image memorability across age groups.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

While human memory has a massive capacity to remember images [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], some are instead forgotten, either immediately or after variable lengths of time. Memorability is indeed a property intrinsic to all images that can be extracted, as well as predicted [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], or manipulated [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Image memorability can most simply be described as the extent to which an image is remembered by human observers after a single exposure. It is defined and quantified as the probability that a repetition of a photograph will be detected by an observer when presented amidst a stream of images at various intervals [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Isola and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] introduced their large-scale visual memory game used to test and quantify the memorability of images and hosted it on Amazon Mechanical Turk to allow for crowdsourcing. This experiment has since been replicated many times [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295940.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295940.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and has formed the foundations of measuring image memorability. Since then, several studies have demonstrated the robustness of memorability rankings across various task settings, and delays [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295940.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Memorability is a critical, intrinsic property of images as previous neuroimaging studies have shown distinct brain patterns differentiating high and low memorability images that appear unconsciously, even when participants are not performing a memory task [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295940.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295940.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, memorability cannot be overridden by an individual: one cannot attempt to forget a memorable image, or remember a forgettable image [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. To understand memorability, the visual memory game described above has been used to assign memorability scores to thousands of images, and it has been shown that certain image features can be extracted and linked to memorability. Specific object categories (people, animals, and vehicles) as well as scene categories (indoor scenes) are more memorable than others [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295940.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295940.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In fact, Isola et al. [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] have reported that the scene category captures most of what makes an image memorable. They also demonstrated that high-level semantic attributes, such as spatial layout, dynamics, and location, are associated with memorability. Saliency and contrast have been shown to be important factors, meaning images with specific points of focus are more memorable [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295940.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Interestingly, image aesthetics and perceived popularity have shown little to no correlation with memorability, despite being correlated to each other [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295940.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295940.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Negative emotions are more memorable than positive emotions, so images that evoke disgust, for example, would be remembered better than those that conjure feelings of amusement [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Colours and colour features such as saturation and hue have little correlation with memorability. Non-semantic image statistics, such as the number of objects in the image, are also not effective predictors of memorability on their own [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>While extensive work has been done to study image memorability in adults, no studies exist regarding the adolescent (ages 11&#x02013;18) population and the differences in image memorability across different age groups at different developmental stages. There are massive differences in the lived experiences of adults and adolescents&#x02014;the objects they interact with daily, their preferences, and their exposure to the external world diverge greatly. For this reason, we expect the memorability of certain images or image categories to differ across the age groups. As well, recognition memory (the ability to recognize a previously-encountered stimulus) is an element of the visual memory game used to quantify image memorability. Recognition memory has been shown to exhibit age-related differences: previous work has demonstrated that recognition memory gradually improves with age throughout childhood and adolescence [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The continued development of neural systems including the ventral temporal cortex [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295940.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], the lateral prefrontal cortex [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and the medial temporal lobes [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] may support the improvement in recognition memory throughout adolescence. Due to these age-related differences in recognition memory, we expect there to be corresponding differences in image memorability. As such, we expect adolescents to not only have lower memorability scores overall, but also have a lower correlation with adult memorability scores than seen in adult-only studies. On the contrary, if image memorability is an intrinsic feature of visual stimuli, resistant even to developmental differences in the brain, image memorability would remain consistent between different ages. This study aims to fill this gap by assigning memorability scores derived from adolescents to images and comparing them to memorability scores derived from adults. If image memorability is truly consistent even across age groups that are known to be developmentally different, this will strengthen the current belief that memorability is in fact intrinsic to the image and independent of the memory process of an individual. We investigate the intrinsic nature of image memorability and whether conclusions from research done in adults can be extrapolated to the adolescent population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 273 participants (143 female) aged 11&#x02013;18 (mean = 16, SD = 2) years were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk, completing an average of six blocks.

The MemCat dataset is publicly available and includes 10,000 images that have been annotated with adult memorability scores. We used adult memorability scores provided by MemCat as a point of comparison to the adolescent memorability scores we obtained in this study. A special feature of the MemCat dataset (compared to other image memorability datasets [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295940.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295940.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295940.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295940.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]) is its hierarchical category structure: it features five main categories (animals, food, landscapes, sports, and vehicles), each with at least 20 subcategories (such as sheep, salad, waterfall, basketball, and airplane). This allowed us to robustly analyze the effects of these categories on memorability, as done previously in adults [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295940.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295940.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. For our adolescent memorability dataset, which we call the Memoir dataset, we randomly sampled 1,000 images from the MemCat dataset equally from each category and from the full range of memorability scores provided in MemCat. Each of the selected images was reviewed by the authors and an ethics board to make sure they were appropriate for the target population (adolescents). Specifically, the images were manually and individually reviewed by three of the authors to exclude any picture with disturbing or emotionally inappropriate content. For this, images were partitioned into three subsets; each author reviewed one of the subsets and flagged any images which were potentially disturbing and inappropriate. The flagged images were reviewed and removed from the dataset subject to unanimous agreement.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Experiment design</title><p>To measure image memorability, we conducted an online visual memory game and recruited participants through Amazon Mechanical Turk.

Participants were shown a sequence of images, each displayed for 600 ms with 800 ms inter-stimulus intervals, and were instructed to press the spacebar when they encountered an image that they remembered being shown previously. The inter-stimulus intervals consisted of a blank white screen with a centered black fixation cross and were shown for 800 ms. While images may have different aspect ratios, they were presented on the screen with the same height. Participants received feedback on their performance during the experiment. If participants correctly identified a target image repeat, a green border appeared around the image, whereas in the case of a false alarm, a red border appeared around the image. The purpose of the feedback was to increase engagement of participants with the experiment and make sure that they understood the task clearly. At the start of the experiment, participants were shown a short demo video to ensure they understood the instructions.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0295940.g001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0295940.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Design of experiment: Images were displayed for 600 ms followed by an 800 ms blank screen with a fixation cross.</title><p>Participants were instructed to press the spacebar when they recognized a second occurrence of any image.

The experiment design is such that each block is independent of other blocks (each target image and corresponding target repeat were always in the same block). Participants were instructed to complete as many blocks as they wish to. Participants could complete a maximum of 10 blocks or exit the game at any time. Participants completed an average of 6 blocks each, resulting in an average of 30 minutes of active experiment time. Each block included 200 images comprised of 66 targets (and 66 target repeats), 56 fillers, and 12 vigilance repeats. Target images were repeated exactly one time and at variable time intervals (after 19&#x02013;149 filler images). The filler images comprised everything in between the targets and were only displayed once, with occasional vigilance repeats of fillers being shown to ensure participants were alert [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Vigilance repeats were used to ensure that the participants were paying attention and participating meaningfully, and were repeated after 0 to 2 images. Both filler and vigilance images were also randomly sampled from the MemCat dataset (as were the target images). This ensured high consistency and similar types of images in the three categories (target, filler, and vigilance images), so participants were not able to differentiate between them. The fillers and vigilance repeats were the same across participants, but not necessarily in the same order&#x02014;they were randomly distributed across levels of the experiment. This experiment allowed for the calculation of image memorability scores as the percentage of correct detections by participants (see Computing Memorability Scores).</p><p>Strict criteria were also used to ensure participants were engaged in the game to guarantee a high quality of results.

We measured the consistency and reliability of the computed memorability scores by splitting the participants into two independent sets, computing their respective memorability scores separately for each set, and calculating the Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation between the two sets (see <xref rid="pone.0295940.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>).

There is a high degree of consistency across participants both within categories and for the data as a whole, although, the consistency was slightly lower when observing individual categories (likely due to a reduced range [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]) A comparison of <xref rid="pone.0295940.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0295940.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 Fig</xref> reveals that the range of memorability scores is indeed smaller within the individual categories, justifying the reduced correlations. Generally, the rank correlations were higher in the <italic toggle="yes">H</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">N</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">resp</italic></sub> scores. Using all available data points and across all categories, the mean split-half rank correlation using this measure was 0.73 (with a mean <italic toggle="yes">N</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">resp</italic></sub> of 94).

Correlations were slightly lower within the categories: 0.70 (landscape), 0.69 (sport), 0.68 (food), 0.67 (vehicle), and 0.63 (animal). The split-half rank correlation typically underestimates the reliability that a full-length test would indicate, as reliability generally increases with the addition of more data points. Therefore, we used the Spearman-Brown formula [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295940.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] to adjust these split-half estimates to reflect total reliabilities more accurately. Using this formula, we achieved the following memorability score reliabilities: 0.84 (all), 0.82 (landscape), 0.82 (sport), 0.81 (food), 0.80 (vehicle), and 0.77 (animal).</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0295940.g003"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0295940.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Split-half consistency across participants of the <italic toggle="yes">H</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">N</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">resp</italic></sub> and (<italic toggle="yes">H</italic> &#x02212; <italic toggle="yes">F</italic>)/<italic toggle="yes">N</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">resp</italic></sub> memorability scores as a function of <italic toggle="yes">N</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">resp</italic></sub>.</title><p>Estimates are based on 25 random splits. <italic toggle="yes">N</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">resp</italic></sub> refers to the total number of data points per image (not to the number that goes into one half during the split-half procedure).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0295940.g003" position="float"/></fig><fig position="float" id="pone.0295940.g004"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0295940.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Distribution of collected memorability scores in younger adolescents (A), older adolescents (B), and adults (C), per the <italic toggle="yes">H</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">N</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">resp</italic></sub> measure.</title><p>Adult data is from the MemCat dataset [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

The ages 15&#x02013;18 sub-group was downsampled to contain the same number of participants (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 64) as the younger sub-group. Due to the increased reliability of the memorability scores calculated using the <italic toggle="yes">H</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">N</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">resp</italic></sub> measure, we restrict the following analysis to these scores. We attribute the higher split-half consistency from the scores without the false alarm correction to the significantly higher false alarms in adolescents. The increased frequency of false alarms induces greater stochasticity within our dataset, which slightly reduces their reliability. We discuss the (<italic toggle="yes">H</italic> &#x02212; <italic toggle="yes">F</italic>)/<italic toggle="yes">N</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">resp</italic></sub> scores and false alarm ratios separately in the next section, and the associated figures are available in the supplementary material.</p><p>

It also shows the global mean memorability score for each of the populations as a horizontal line. Mean memorability scores in both adolescent sub-groups were identical (<italic toggle="yes">M</italic> = 0.74, <italic toggle="yes">SD</italic> = 0.15), and comparable to mean memorability scores in adults (<italic toggle="yes">M</italic> = 0.76, <italic toggle="yes">SD</italic> = 0.14). The memorability scores of the total adolescent group and the adult group were also strongly and significantly correlated (Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation, <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.76, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). We note that this rank correlation is very close to the total mean split-half rank correlation (0.84) established in (Adolescent Memorability Scores). To account for the differences in the number of responses per image in Memoir and MemCat, we used an additional down-sampling procedure to match the number of responses per image in both groups and computed the correlations. This consisted of down-sampling the responses of each target image to have an equal number of responses in both age groups, and calculating the Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation at different down-sampling levels. The down-sampled memorability scores were similarly correlated (Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation, <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.73, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), so the slight differences in number of responses per image in the two groups does not have a significant effect on our results. The full results of this analysis are provided in <xref rid="pone.0295940.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>. The rank correlations between the adolescent sub-groups and the adult group were also strong and significant: <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.67, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 in the younger group and <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.60, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 in the older group. Rank correlation between the two adolescent sub-groups was <italic toggle="yes">r</italic> = 0.58, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001. Note that these correlations are lower because the range of memorability scores in each sub-group is smaller than in the total adolescent population, and correlation typically depends on the range of measures being assessed [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These results suggest that memorability rankings are consistent not only across adolescent and adult age groups, but also within the different adolescent sub-groups that contain participants at different developmental stages.

The increased stochasticity that is introduced with the higher number of false alarms might also explain why, in the previous section (Comparing Adolescent and Adult Image Memorability Scores), we observed a greater reduction in adolescent memorability scores and rank correlations than MemCat when using the memorability measure with the false alarm correction (see <xref rid="pone.0295940.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).

We compared the quadrant assignment agreements between adolescents and adults to determine if the same images were truly memorable for both populations.

For this, we put together the Memoir dataset, including 1,000 images with their corresponding memorability scores obtained from an online memory task performed by adolescents (11&#x02013;18 years old). The images were randomly sampled from the MemCat dataset [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], a large category-based memorability dataset in adults. Therefore, similar to MemCat, our dataset is also organized in five broad categories of food, animal, sports, vehicle, and landscape. We found memorability rankings were consistent across adolescents age groups (11&#x02013;14, and 15&#x02013;18 years old) and adults, indicating that viewer age is not a factor in determining the memorability of images. This is consistent with previous findings that show memorability is intrinsic to the image, more so than the observer [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295940.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295940.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295940.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295940.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. There of course do exist inter-individual effects, but they are neutralized as the memorability rankings converge to their true value. In addition to individual image rankings, category rankings are also consistent across adolescents and adults. Food images are the most memorable, while landscape images are the least memorable.</p><p>Beyond the similar memorability rankings, our data also showed very similar mean memorability scores in adolescents (<italic toggle="yes">M</italic> = 0.74) and adults (<italic toggle="yes">M</italic> = 0.76). This is surprising because recognition memory gradually improves with age throughout adolescence [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295940.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]; we expected to see a difference in mean scores reflected both in our comparison of raw memorability scores within adolescent sub-groups and between adolescents and adults. This finding strengthens the current literature that suggests image memorability is independent of subjective memory processes in the brain, and instead, arises as an inherent attribute of the stimulus (image). Further research should further investigate image memorability in even younger children to challenge this theory further and observe image memorability in children whose recognition memory is even less developed. Guo and Bainbridge in a very recent work [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] observed image memorability in even younger children, and found that adult-like sensitivity to image memorability emerges by the age of four through experience. This further supports our findings that adolescents indeed portray similar memorability patterns as adults across images.</p><p>Equally interesting is the recent work in older adults on the effects of cognitive decline on image memorability. A recent study [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] explored image memorability in individuals with memory impairments (such as mild cognitive impairment or subjective cognitive decline) to determine if differences in memorability on specific images could be used to distinguish between memory-impaired individuals and healthy controls. They were able to identify a set of images that were highly memorable to healthy controls but highly forgettable to individuals with memory impairments. Remarkably, some images remained consistently and highly memorable in both healthy controls and memory-impaired individuals, and memorability scores for those images could be predicted by deep learning models.</p><p>While the ranking of image memorability was similar in adolescents and adults, adolescents experienced significantly higher false alarm rates with a distinct distribution pattern. This differs from studies examining only adults [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295940.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], which found that the false alarm correction improved the prediction rank correlation within their data. It is possible that when comparing memorability scores broadly from two different distributions, that the false alarm correction introduces too much variability in the data. In this study we decided to make use of the simpler <italic toggle="yes">H</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">N</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">resp</italic></sub> memorability score to analyze the data as a whole, and conducted a separate false alarm rate analysis.</p><p>Adolescence is widely recognized as a developmental period during which risk-taking and reward-seeking behaviours are increased. By the time they reach adulthood, adolescents&#x02019; risk-taking declines due to structural and functional changes in the brain&#x02019;s cognitive control system [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295940.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The increased cognitive control that comes with the maturation of the brain [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] may explain the higher false alarm rates we observed in adolescents. Their increased impulsivity and need for immediate rewards combined with the rapid nature of the visual memory game may have caused adolescents to be less patient or cautious with their button presses than adults. This is also consistent with a recent work by [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] which shows higher false alarm rate in teens than young adults (in twenties) when tested on working memory and memory recognition tasks. The authors find a lower false alarm rate in a 0-back task compared to a 2-back task. This indicates a correlation between the task load and the false alarm rates in adolescents. In our experiment target images were repeated after 19&#x02013;149 filler images; this makes our task more challenging and hence an increase in the false alarm rates is expected. Despite this, we find that for both adolescents and adults the same images are likely to fall into the &#x0201c;truly memorable&#x0201d; category. A Bland-Altman analysis of the Memoir and MemCat data, using both the scores with the false alarms and without, revealed that the mean difference of memorability scores is higher using the false alarm correction (there are more discrepancies). Further, we observed no relationship between the Memoir and MemCat discrepancies and the memorability scores using either measure, so the limits of agreement (LoA) are valid (see <xref rid="pone.0295940.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref> Taken together with the high rank correlation between the adolescent and adult memorability scores, we can conclude that memorability is highly consistent and reliable across these two age groups.</p><p>Within the realm of adolescent cognition, the significance of visual memorability extends notably to educational contexts, particularly concerning individuals in their youth who contend with specific developmental or learning disorders. The present investigation has revealed a notable degree of consistency in memorability ratings derived from cohorts of adolescents and adults. This discovery underscores the inherent characteristic of image memorability and substantiates the viability of utilizing large image memorability datasets, curated through the participation of adult subjects, for prospective inquiries involving the adolescent demographic.</p><p>A notable challenge inherent to online studies, including ours, is verifying participants&#x02019; self-reported ages. Given the nature of online experiments, there&#x02019;s no foolproof way to confirm the accuracy of age information provided by participants. This limitation is not unique to our study but is a common concern in online research settings. Future studies might consider conducting in-person experiments, where age verification is more feasible. Approaches like recruiting participants through schools, sports teams, and youth clubs can also help mitigate the risk of inaccurate age reporting typically associated with online methodologies.</p></sec><sec id="sec013" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0295940.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Box-plot depicting distribution of collected memorability scores in younger adolescents, older adolescents, and adults, per the (<italic toggle="yes">H</italic> &#x02212; <italic toggle="yes">F</italic>)/<italic toggle="yes">N</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">resp</italic></sub> measure.</title><p>Adult data is from the MemCat dataset [<xref rid="pone.0295940.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].
