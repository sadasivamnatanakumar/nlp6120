Recent studies have discovered that a subset of mammalian antiviral proteins have homology to antiphage defense proteins in bacteria, implying that there are aspects of innate immunity that are shared across the Tree of Life. While the majority of these studies have focused on characterizing the diversity and biochemical functions of the bacterial proteins, the evolutionary relationships between animal and bacterial proteins are less clear. This ambiguity is partly due to the long evolutionary distances separating animal and bacterial proteins, which obscures their relationships. Here, we tackle this problem for 3 innate immune families (CD-NTases [including cGAS], STINGs, and viperins) by deeply sampling protein diversity across eukaryotes. We find that viperins and OAS family CD-NTases are ancient immune proteins, likely inherited since the earliest eukaryotes first arose. In contrast, we find other immune proteins that were acquired via at least 4 independent events of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from bacteria. Two of these events allowed algae to acquire new bacterial viperins, while 2 more HGT events gave rise to distinct superfamilies of eukaryotic CD-NTases: the cGLR superfamily (containing cGAS) that has since diversified via a series of animal-specific duplications and a previously undefined eSMODS superfamily, which more closely resembles bacterial CD-NTases. Finally, we found that cGAS and STING proteins have substantially different histories, with STING protein domains undergoing convergent domain shuffling in bacteria and eukaryotes. Overall, our findings paint a picture of eukaryotic innate immunity as highly dynamic, where eukaryotes build upon their ancient antiviral repertoires through the reuse of protein domains and by repeatedly sampling a rich reservoir of bacterial antiphage genes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>How and when did our innate immune systems first evolve?

Until recently, many components of innate immunity were thought to be lineage-specific [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, new studies have revealed that an ever-growing number of proteins used in mammalian antiviral immunity are homologous to bacterial immune proteins used to fight off bacteriophage infections. This list includes Argonaute, CARD domains, cGAS and other CD-NTases, Death-like domains, Gasdermin, NACHT domains, STING, SamHD1, TRADD-N domains, TIR domains, and viperin, among others [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Perhaps one of the most exciting discoveries from these bacterial defense systems is the highly varied biochemical functions carried out by these bacterial proteins. For example, bacterial cGAS-DncV-like nucleotidyltransferases (CD-NTases), which generate cyclic nucleotide messengers (similar to cGAS), are massively diverse with over 6,000 CD-NTase proteins discovered to date. Beyond the cyclic GMP-AMP signals produced by animal cGAS proteins, bacterial CD-NTases are capable of producing a wide array of nucleotide signals including cyclic dinucleotides, cyclic trinucleotides, and linear oligonucleotides [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Many of these bacterial CD-NTase products are critical for bacterial defense against viral infections [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Interestingly, these discoveries with the CD-NTases mirror what has been discovered with bacterial viperins. In mammals, viperin proteins restrict viral replication by generating 3&#x02032;-deoxy-3&#x02032;,4&#x02032;didehdro- (ddh) nucleotides [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which block RNA synthesis and thereby inhibit viral replication [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Mammalian viperin generates ddhCTP molecules while bacterial viperins can generate ddhCTP, ddhUTP, and ddhGTP. In some cases, a single bacterial protein is capable of synthesizing 2 or 3 of these ddh derivatives [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These discoveries have been surprising and exciting, as they imply that some cellular defenses have deep commonalities spanning across the entire Tree of Life, with additional new mechanisms of immunity waiting to be discovered within diverse microbial lineages. But despite significant homology, these bacterial and animal immune proteins are often distinct in their molecular functions and operate within dramatically different signaling pathways (reviewed here [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]). How, then, have animals and other eukaryotes acquired these immune proteins?</p><p>One common hypothesis in the field is that these immune proteins are ancient and have been inherited since the last common ancestor of bacteria and eukaryotes [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In other cases, horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between bacteria and eukaryotes has been invoked to explain the similarities [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, because most papers in this field have focused on searching genomic databases for new bacterial immune genes and biochemically characterizing them, the evolution of these proteins in eukaryotes has not been as thoroughly investigated.</p><p>We investigated the ancestry of 3 gene families that are shared between animal and bacterial immunity: Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING), cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and its broader family of CD-NTases, and viperin. STING, CD-NTases, and viperin are all interferon-stimulated genes that function as antiviral immune modules, disrupting the viral life cycle by activating downstream immune genes, sensing viral infection, or disrupting viral processes, respectively [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We choose to focus on the cGAS, STING, and viperin for a number of reasons. First, in metazoans cGAS and STING are part of the same signaling pathway, whereas bacterial CD-NTases often act independently of bacterial STINGs [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], raising interesting questions about how eukaryotic immune proteins have gained their signaling partners. Also, given the vast breadth of bacterial CD-NTase diversity, we were curious as to if any eukaryotes had acquired CD-NTases distinct from cGAS. For similar reasons, we investigated viperin, which also has a wide diversity in bacteria but a much more narrow described function in eukaryotes.</p><p>We found eukaryotic CD-NTases arose following multiple HGT events between bacteria and eukaryotes. cGAS fall within a unique, mainly metazoan clade. In contrast, OAS-like proteins were independently acquired and are the predominant type of CD-NTase found across most eukaryotes. Separately, we have discovered diverged eukaryotic STING proteins that bridge the evolutionary gap between metazoan and bacterial STINGs, as well as 2 separate instances where bacteria and eukaryotes have acquired similar proteins via convergent domain shuffling. Finally, we find that viperin was likely present in the LECA and possibly earlier, with both broad representation across the eukaryotic tree of life and evidence of 2 additional HGT events where eukaryotes recently acquired new bacterial viperins. Overall, our results demonstrate that immune proteins shared between bacteria and eukaryotes are evolutionarily dynamic, with eukaryotes taking multiple routes to acquire and deploy these ancient immune modules.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Discovering immune homologs across the eukaryotic tree of life</title><p>The first step to understanding the evolution of CD-NTases, STINGs, and viperins was to acquire sequences for these proteins from across the eukaryotic tree. To search for diverse immune homologs, we employed a hidden Markov model (HMM) strategy, which has high sensitivity, a low number of false positives, and the ability to separately analyze multiple (potentially independently evolving) domains in the same protein [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We used this HMM strategy to search the EukProt database, which has been developed to reflect the true scope of eukaryotic diversity through the genomes and transcriptomes of nearly 1,000 species, specifically selected to span the eukaryotic tree [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. EukProt contains sequences from NCBI and Ensembl, plus many diverged eukaryotic species not found in any other database, making it a unique resource for eukaryotic diversity [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. While it can be challenging to acquire diverse eukaryotic sequences from traditional databases due to an overrepresentation of metazoan data [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], EukProt ameliorates this bias by downsampling traditionally overrepresented taxa.</p><p>To broaden our searches from initial animal homologs to eukaryotic sequences more generally, we used iterative HMM searches of the EukProt database, incorporating the hits from each search into the subsequent HMM. After using this approach to create pan-eukaryotic HMMs for each protein family, we then added in bacterial homologs to generate universal HMMs (Figs <xref rid="pbio.3002436.g001" ref-type="fig">1A</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.3002436.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>), continuing our iterative searches until we either failed to find any new protein sequences or began finding proteins outside of the family of interest (<xref rid="pbio.3002436.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). To define the boundaries that separated our proteins of interest from neighboring gene families, we focused on including homologs that shared protein domains that defined that family (see <xref rid="sec008" ref-type="sec">Materials and methods</xref> for domain designations) and were closer to in-group sequences than the outgroup sequences on a phylogenetic tree (outgroup sequences are noted in the Materials and methods).</p><p>Our searches for CD-NTases, STINGs, and viperins recovered hundreds of eukaryotic proteins from each family, including a particularly large number of metazoan sequences (red bars, <xref rid="pbio.3002436.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). It is not surprising that we found so many metazoan homologs, as each of these proteins was discovered and characterized in metazoans and these animal genomes tend to be of higher quality than other taxa (<xref rid="pbio.3002436.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). We also recovered homologs from other species spread across the eukaryotic tree, demonstrating that our approach could successfully identify deeply diverged homologs (<xref rid="pbio.3002436.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). However, outside of Metazoa, these homologs were sparsely distributed, such that for most species in our dataset (711/993), we did not recover proteins from any of the 3 immune families examined (white space, lack of colored bars, <xref rid="pbio.3002436.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>). While some of these absences may be due to technical errors or dataset incompleteness (<xref rid="pbio.3002436.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>), we interpret this pattern as a reflection of ongoing, repeated gene losses across eukaryotes, as has been found for other innate immune proteins [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and other types of gene families surveyed across eukaryotes [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Indeed, many of the species that lacked any of the immune homologs were represented by high-quality datasets (Ex: Metazoa, Chlorplastida, and Fungi). Thus, although it is always possible that our approach has missed some homologs, we believe the resulting data represents a fair assessment of the diversity across eukaryotes, at least for those species currently included within EukProt.</p><fig position="float" id="pbio.3002436.g001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.3002436.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>HMM searches to find homologs across the eukaryotic Tree of Life.</title><p>(A) A schematic of the HMM search process. Starting from initial, animal-dominated HMM profiles for each protein family, we used iterative HMM searches of the EukProt database to generate pan-eukaryotic HMMs. These were combined with bacterial sequences to enable discovery of bacteria-like homologs in eukaryotes.

Indeed, the majority of animal CD-NTases (cGAS, Mid51, Mab21, Mab21L1/2/3/4, Mb21d2, ITPRI) are paralogs within the cGLR superfamily, which arose from repeated animal-specific duplications [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] (<xref rid="pbio.3002436.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). In contrast, unlike the animal-dominated cGLR superfamily, the OAS superfamily spans a broad group of eukaryotic taxa, with OAS-like homologs present in 8/12 eukaryotic supergroups. This distribution makes OAS proteins the most common CD-NTases found across eukaryotes and implies that they arose very early in eukaryotic history, possibly before the LECA.</p><p>Given the connections between cGAS and STING in both animals and some bacteria [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], we asked whether species that encode STING also have cGLR and/or OAS proteins. Because the cGLR superfamily is largely animal specific, we performed this analysis separately in either Metazoa or with all non-metazoan eukaryotes (<xref rid="pbio.3002436.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). In animal species where we found a STING homolog, we also typically found a cGLR superfamily sequence (32/34), and specifically a cGAS homolog (26/34 species) (<xref rid="pbio.3002436.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>), consistent with the consensus that these proteins are functionally linked. We also observed 19 metazoan species that had a cGLR-like sequence with no detectable STING homolog. Almost half of these species (10/19) were arthropods, aligning with prior findings of STING sparseness among arthropods [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. We did find STING homologs in 8/19 arthropod species in EukProt v3, including the previously identified STINGs of <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Apis mellifera</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Tribolium castaneum</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Outside of animals, we found that species with a STING homolog typically did not have a detectable CD-NTase protein from either superfamily (22/34). While it remains possible that these STING proteins function together with a to-be-discovered CD-NTase that was absent from our dataset, we therefore hypothesize that many eukaryotes outside of metazoans and their close relatives [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] use STING and CD-NTase homologs independently of each other.</p><p>What was the evolutionary origin of eukaryotic CD-NTases? Interestingly, the cGLR and OAS superfamilies are only distantly related to one another. Each lies nested within a different, previously defined, bacterial CD-NTase clade (<xref rid="pbio.3002436.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). The OAS superfamily falls within bacterial Clade C (with the closest related bacterial CD-NTases being those of subclade C02-C03, <xref rid="pbio.3002436.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>), while the metazoan cGLR superfamily lies within bacterial Clade D (subclade D12) (<xref rid="pbio.3002436.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>). We note that in this tree (<xref rid="pbio.3002436.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>), Clade D does not form a single coherent clade, as was also true in the phylogeny that originally defined the bacterial CD-NTase clades [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>We also observed a number of eukaryotic sequences scattered across different bacterial CD-NTase clades (<xref rid="pbio.3002436.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>, colored branches within gray clades). While some of these may reflect additional HGT events, others likely come from technical artifacts such as bacterial contamination of eukaryotic sequences. To minimize such false positive HGT calls, we took a conservative approach in our analyses, considering potential bacteria&#x02013;eukaryote HGT events to be trustworthy only if: (1) eukaryotic and bacterial sequences branched adjacent to one another with strong support (bootstrap values &#x0003e;70); (2) the eukaryotic sequences formed a distinct subclade, represented by at least 2 species from the same eukaryotic supergroup; (3) the eukaryotic sequences were produced by at least 2 different studies; and (4) the position of the horizontally transferred sequences was robust across all alignment and phylogenetic reconstruction methods used (<xref rid="pbio.3002436.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Fig</xref>). For species represented only by transcriptomes, these criteria may still have difficulty distinguishing eukaryote&#x02013;bacteria HGT from certain specific scenarios such as the long-term presence of dedicated, eukaryote-associated, bacterial symbionts. However, because these criteria allow us to focus on relatively old HGT events, they give us higher confidence these events are likely to be real.</p><p>The cGLR superfamily passed all 4 of the HGT thresholds, as did another eukaryotic clade of CD-NTases that were all previously undescribed. We name this clade the eukaryotic SMODS (eSMODS) superfamily, because the top scoring domain from hmmscan for each sequence in this superfamily was the SMODS domain (PF18144), which is typically found only in bacterial CD-NTases (<xref rid="pbio.3002436.s032" ref-type="supplementary-material">S25 File</xref>). This sequence similarity suggests that eSMODS arose following a recent HGT from bacteria and/or that these CD-NTases have diverged from their bacterial predecessors less than the eukaryotic OAS and cGLR families have. Additionally, all of the eSMODS sequences were predicted to have a Nucleotidyltransferase domain (PF01909), and (8/12) had a Polymerase Beta domain (PF18765), which are features shared with many bacterial CD-NTases in Clades D, E, and F (<xref rid="pbio.3002436.s032" ref-type="supplementary-material">S25 File</xref>). The eSMODS superfamily is made up of sequences from Amoebozoa, choanoflagellates, Ancryomonadida, and 1 animal (the sponge <italic toggle="yes">Oscarella pearsei</italic>), which clustered together robustly and with high support (ultrafast bootstrap value of 99) within bacterial Clade D (e.g., subclade D04, CD-NTase 22 from <italic toggle="yes">Myxococcus xanthus</italic>) (<xref rid="pbio.3002436.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). The eSMODS placement on the tree was robust to all alignment and phylogenetic algorithms used (<xref rid="pbio.3002436.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Fig</xref>), suggesting that eSMODS represent an additional, independent acquisition of CD-NTases from bacteria.</p><p>CD-NTases from bacterial Clade C and Clade D are the only CD-NTases to produce cyclic trinucleotides, producing cyclic tri-Adenylate and cAAG, respectively [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Interestingly, OAS produces linear adenylates, which is one step away from the cAAA product made by previously characterized Class C CD-NTases, and similarly cGAMP (made by cGAS) is one adenylate away from the Clade D product cAAG. As of this writing, the Clade D CD-NTases closest to the eSMODS and cGLR superfamilies (D04 and D12, respectively) have not been well characterized. Therefore, we argue that these CD-NTases should be a focus of future studies, as they may hint at the evolutionary stepping stones that allow eukaryotes to acquire bacterial immune proteins.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Diverged eukaryotic STINGs bridge the gap between bacteria and animals</title><p>We next turned to analyze STING proteins. In animals, STING is a critical cyclic dinucleotide sensor, important during viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections (reviewed here [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]). Structurally, most metazoan STINGs consist of an N-terminal transmembrane domain (TM), made of 4 alpha helices fused to a C-terminal STING domain [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Canonical animal STINGs show distant homology with STING effectors from the bacterial CBASS, with major differences in protein structure and pathway function between these animal and bacterial defenses. For example, in bacteria, the majority of STING proteins are fusions of a STING domain to a TIR (Toll/interleukin-1 receptor) domain (<xref rid="pbio.3002436.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>).

Prior to this work, the phylogenetic relationship between animal and bacterial STINGs has been difficult to characterize with high support [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Indeed, when we made a tree of previously known animal and bacterial STING domains, we found that the metazoan sequences were separated from the bacterial sequences by one very long branch, along which many changes had occurred (<xref rid="pbio.3002436.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>).</p><p>To improve the phylogeny through the inclusion of a greater diversity of eukaryotic STING sequences, we began by carefully identifying the region of STING that was homologous between bacterial and animal STINGs, as we expected this region to be best conserved across diverse eukaryotes. Although Pfam domain PF15009 (TMEM173) is commonly used to define animal STING domains, this HMM includes a portion of STING&#x02019;s transmembrane domain which is not shared by bacterial STINGs. Therefore, we compared the crystal structures of HsSTING (6NT5), <italic toggle="yes">Flavobacteriaceae</italic> sp. STING (6WT4), and <italic toggle="yes">Crassostrea gigas</italic> STING (6WT7) to define a core &#x0201c;STING&#x0201d; domain.

Our searches yielded 146 eukaryotic sequences from 64 species, which included STING homologs from 34 metazoans (<xref rid="pbio.3002436.s038" ref-type="supplementary-material">S31 File</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.3002436.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Using maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction on the STING domain alone, we identified STING-like sequences from 26 diverse microeukaryotes whose STING domains clustered in between bacterial and metazoan sequences, breaking up the long branch. We name these sequences the bacteria-like STINGs (blSTINGs) because they were the only eukaryotic group of STINGs with a bacteria-like Prok_STING domain (PF20300) and because of the short branch length (0.86 versus 1.8) separating them from bacterial STINGs on the tree (<xref rid="pbio.3002436.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). While a previous study reported STING domains in 2 eukaryotic species (1 in Stramenopiles and 1 in Haptista) [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], we were able to expand this set to additional species and also recover blSTINGs from Amoebozoa, Rhizaria, and choanoflagellates. This diversity allowed us to place the sequences on the tree with high confidence (bootstrap value &#x0003e;70), recovering a substantially different tree than previous work [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. As for CD-NTases, the tree topology we recovered was robust across multiple different alignment and phylogenetic tree construction algorithms (<xref rid="pbio.3002436.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Fig</xref>).</p><p>Given the similarities between the STING domains of the blSTINGs and bacterial STINGs, we next asked whether the domain architectures of these proteins were similar using Hmmscan and AlphaFold. The majority of the new eukaryotic blSTINGs were predicted to have 4 N-terminal alpha helices (<xref rid="pbio.3002436.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.3002436.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5 File</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.3002436.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6 File</xref>), similar to human STING. While bacterial TM-STINGs had superficially similar N-terminal transmembrane domains, these proteins were predicted to have only 2 alpha helices and in all phylogenetic trees the STING domains from bacterial TM-STINGs were more similar to other bacterial STINGs than to eukaryotic homologs (<xref rid="pbio.3002436.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Fig</xref>). These results suggest that eukaryotes and bacteria independently converged on a common TM-STING domain architecture through domain shuffling.</p><p>Interestingly, a similar pattern of convergent domain shuffling appears to have occurred a second time with the TIR-STING proteins. Some eukaryotes, such as the oyster <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">gigas</italic>, have a TIR-STING fusion protein [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].

We also investigated the possibility that <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">gigas</italic> acquired the TIR-domain of its TIR-STING protein via HGT from bacteria; however, this analysis also suggested an animal origin for the TIR domain (<xref rid="pbio.3002436.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>), as the <italic toggle="yes">C</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">gigas</italic> TIR domain clustered with other metazoan TIR domains such as <italic toggle="yes">Homo sapiens</italic> TICAM1 and 2 (ultrafast bootstrap value of 75). Eukaryotic TIR-STINGs are also rare, further supporting the hypothesis that this protein resulted from recent convergence, where animals independently fused STING and TIR domains to make a protein resembling bacterial TIR-STINGs, consistent with previous reports [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Overall, the phylogenetic tree we constructed (<xref rid="pbio.3002436.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>) suggests that there is domain-level homology between bacterial and eukaryotic STINGs, but due to sparseness and lack of a suitable outgroup, this tree does not definitively explain the eukaryotic origin of the STING domain. However, the data does clearly support a model in which convergent domain shuffling in eukaryotes and bacteria generated similar TM-STING and TIR-STING proteins independently. Interestingly, the non-metazoan, blSTINGs (<xref rid="pbio.3002436.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>) that are found in the Stramenopiles, Haptista, Rhizaria, Choanoflagellates, and Amoebozoa have a TM-STING domain architecture similar to animal STINGs but a STING domain more similar to bacterial STINGs.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Viperin is an ancient and widespread immune family</title><p>Viperins are innate immune proteins that restrict the replication of a diverse array of viruses by conversion of nucleotides into 3&#x02032;-deoxy-3&#x02032;,4&#x02032;didehdro- (ddh) nucleotides [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

But how did these similarities come to exist? Here, we uncover several evolutionary trajectories that have led animals and bacteria to share homologous immune proteins (summarized in <xref rid="pbio.3002436.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>). We found that viperin dates back to at least the LECA and likely further. This finding has been recently confirmed through 2 studies that extend viperin history through Archaea [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. We also uncovered examples of convergence, as in STING, where the shuffling of ancient domains has led animals and bacteria to independently arrive at similar protein architectures. Finally, we found evidence of multiple examples of bacteria&#x02013;eukaryote HGTs that have given rise to immune protein families. An essential part of our ability to make these discoveries was the analysis of data from nearly 1,000 diverse eukaryotic taxa. These organisms allowed us to distinguish between proteins found across eukaryotes versus animal-specific innovations, to document both recent and ancient HGT events from bacteria that gave rise to eukaryotic immune protein families (Figs <xref rid="pbio.3002436.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.3002436.g004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), and to identify STING proteins with eukaryotic domain architectures but more bacteria-like domains (blSTINGs, <xref rid="pbio.3002436.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). Because these diverged eukaryotic STINGs were found in organisms where we typically did not find any CD-NTase proteins, we hypothesize that blSTINGs may detect and respond to exogenous cyclic nucleotides, such as those generated by pathogens. In contrast to the STINGs, the eukaryotic CD-NTases had substantially different evolutionary histories, with multiple major CD-NTase superfamilies each emerging from within larger bacterial clades. While these analyses cannot definitively determine the directionality of the transfer, we favor the most parsimonious explanation that these components came into the eukaryotic lineage from bacterial origins.</p><fig position="float" id="pbio.3002436.g005"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.3002436.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Proposed model of evolutionary history of CD-NTases, STING, and viperin.</title><p>Summary of the proposed evolutionary history of each innate immune gene family. (A) We define 2 distinct superfamilies of CD-NTases that likely arose from bacteria&#x02013;eukaryote HGT: eSMODS and cGLRs. Within the cGLR superfamily (which contains cGAS), a number of animal-specific duplications gave rise to numerous paralogs. The OAS superfamily of CD-NTases are abundant across diverse eukaryotic taxa and were likely present in the LECA. (B) Drawing on a shared ancient repertoire of protein domains that includes STING, TIR, and transmembrane (TM) domains, bacteria and eukaryotes have convergently evolved similar STING proteins through domain shuffling. (C) Viperins are widespread across the eukaryotic tree and likely were present in the LECA. In addition, 2 sets of recent HGT events from bacteria have equipped algal species with new viperins. CD-NTase, cGAS-DncV-like nucleotidyltransferase; HGT, horizontal gene transfer; LECA, last eukaryotic common ancestor; STING, Stimulator of Interferon Genes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.3002436.g005" position="float"/></fig><p>While not as prevalent as in bacteria, HGT in eukaryotes represents a significant force in evolution, especially for unicellular species [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In this study, our criteria for &#x0201c;calling&#x0201d; HGT events was relatively strict, meaning that our estimate of HGT events is almost certainly an underestimate. Importantly, this pattern suggests that the bacterial pan-genome has been a rich reservoir that eukaryotes have repeatedly sampled to acquire novel innate immune components. Some of these HGT events have given rise to new eukaryotic superfamilies (e.g., eSMODS) that have never been characterized and could represent novel types of eukaryotic immune proteins. We speculate that the eSMODS superfamily CD-NTases and the blSTINGs may function more similarly to their bacterial homologs, potentially producing and responding to a variety of cyclic di- or tri-nucleotides [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Similarly, bacterial viperins have been shown to generate ddhCTP, ddhGTP, and ddhUTP, whereas animal viperins only make ddhCTP [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Thus, the 2 algal viperin clades arising from HGT may have expanded functional capabilities as well. A caveat of this work is that such strictly bioinformatic investigations are insufficient to reveal protein biochemical functions nor can they determine whether diverse homologs have been co-opted for non-immune functions. We therefore urge future, functional studies to focus on these proteins to resolve the questions of (1) whether/how blSTINGs operate in the absence of CD-NTases; (2) whether/how the functions of algal viperins and eSMODS changed following their acquisition from bacteria; and (3) whether the homologs truly function in immune defense.</p><p>In addition to these instances of gene gain, eukaryotic gene repertoires have been dramatically shaped by losses. Even for viperins, which likely date back to the eukaryotic last common ancestor, these proteins were sparsely distributed across eukaryotes and were absent from the majority of species we surveyed. While some of this finding may be due to technical limitations, such as dataset incompleteness or inability of the HMMs to recover distant homologs, we believe this explanation is insufficient to fully explain the sparseness, as many plant, fungal, and amoebozoan species are represented by well-assembled genomes where these proteins are certifiably absent (<xref rid="pbio.3002436.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). Instead, we propose that the sparse distribution likely arises from ongoing and repeated gene loss, as has been previously documented for other gene families across the eukaryotic Tree of Life [<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.3002436.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Overall, our results yield a highly dynamic picture of immune protein evolution across eukaryotes, wherein multiple mechanisms of gene gain are offset by ongoing losses.

Then, we added in bacterial sequences and searched with a mixed bacterial-eukaryotic HMM search until we either found no new hits, or until we began getting hits from an outgroup gene family.

Blue boxes and blue shaded region show eukaryotic-only searches to create pan-eukaryotic HMMs and yellow indicates eukaryotic-bacterial searches to create universal HMMs. For the combined bacterial/eukaryotic searches (yellow box), bacterial and eukaryotic sequences were each downsampled to 50 sequences (phylogenetic tree downsampled via PDA) to maintain equal contributions from bacteria and eukaryotic sequences. Separately, bacterial sequences were aligned and used to make an HMM which was used to search EukProt as a &#x0201c;bacteria only search&#x0201d; and for STING we searched with PF15009 for a comparable Eukaryotic PFAM search (not shown in flowchart). We did this extra search for STING as PF15009 contains part of the eukaryotic STING transmembrane domain and so our first search with STING was with a STING-domain-only HMM (see <xref rid="sec008" ref-type="sec">Materials and methods</xref>).

</p><p>Dear Dr. Levin,</p><p>Thank you for your patience while your manuscript "Eukaryotic antiviral immune proteins arose via domain shuffling, horizontal transfer, and ancient inheritance" along with the reviews from Review Commons was being assessed at PLOS Biology. It has now been evaluated by the PLOS Biology editors and an Academic Editor with relevant expertise, and by several independent reviewers.</p><p>Based on our Academic Editor's assessment of your revision, we are likely to accept this manuscript for publication, provided you satisfactorily address the following data and other policy-related requests.</p><p>1. DATA POLICY:</p><p>You may be aware of the PLOS Data Policy, which requires that all data be made available without restriction: <ext-link xlink:href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/data-availability" ext-link-type="uri">http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/s/data-availability</ext-link>. For more information, please also see this editorial: <ext-link xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001797" ext-link-type="uri">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001797</ext-link></p><p>Note that we do not require all raw data. Rather, we ask that all individual quantitative observations that underlie the data summarized in the figures and results of your paper be made available in one of the following forms:</p><p>A) Supplementary files (e.g., excel). Please ensure that all data files are uploaded as 'Supporting Information' and are invariably referred to (in the manuscript, figure legends, and the Description field when uploading your files) using the following format verbatim: S1 Data, S2 Data, etc. Multiple panels of a single or even several figures can be included as multiple sheets in one excel file that is saved using exactly the following convention: S1_Data.xlsx (using an underscore).</p><p>B) Deposition in a publicly available repository. Please also provide the accession code or a reviewer link so that we may view your data before publication.</p><p>Regardless of the method selected, please ensure that you provide the individual numerical values that underlie the summary data displayed in the following figure panels as they are essential for readers to assess your analysis and to reproduce it: Figures 1B, 2ABCD, 3BC, 4, and Supplementary Figures SF1B, SF2AB, SF3A, SF4, SF5, SF6, SF7.</p><p>NOTE: the numerical data provided should include all replicates AND the way in which the plotted mean and errors were derived (it should not present only the mean/average values).</p><p>
<bold>Please also ensure that figure legends in your manuscript include information on where the underlying data can be found, and ensure your supplemental data file/s has a legend.</bold>
</p><p>Please ensure that your Data Statement in the submission system accurately describes where your data can be found.</p><p>2. CODE POLICY</p><p>Per journal policy, as the code that you have generated is important to support the conclusions of your manuscript, we require that you make it available without restrictions upon publication. Please ensure that the code is sufficiently well documented and reusable, and that your Data Statement in the Editorial Manager submission system accurately describes where your code can be found.</p><p>3. We think the title is misleading - as currently written, it implies that all eukaryotic antiviral immune proteins arose via shuffling, transfer, and ancient inheritence, but the paper documents this for a limited set of eukaryotic proteins. We suggest a more specific title: "Eukaryotic antiviral immune proteins of the CD-NTase, STING and viperin families arose from bacteria via domain shuffling, horizontal transfer and ancient inheritance".</p><p>As you address these items, please take this last chance to review your reference list to ensure that it is complete and correct. If you have cited papers that have been retracted, please include the rationale for doing so in the manuscript text, or remove these references and replace them with relevant current references. Any changes to the reference list should be mentioned in the cover letter that accompanies your revised manuscript.</p><p>We expect to receive your revised manuscript within two weeks.</p><p>To submit your revision, please go to <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pbiology/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pbiology/</ext-link> and log in as an Author. Click the link labelled 'Submissions Needing Revision' to find your submission record. Your revised submission must include the following:</p><p>- a cover letter that should detail your responses to any editorial requests, if applicable, and whether changes have been made to the reference list</p><p>- a Response to Reviewers file that provides a detailed response to the reviewers' comments (if applicable, if not applicable please do not delete your existing 'Response to Reviewers' file.)</p><p>- a track-changes file indicating any changes that you have made to the manuscript.</p><p>NOTE: If Supporting Information files are included with your article, note that these are not copyedited and will be published as they are submitted. Please ensure that these files are legible and of high quality (at least 300 dpi) in an easily accessible file format. For this reason, please be aware that any references listed in an SI file will not be indexed. For more information, see our Supporting Information guidelines:</p><p>
