For example, in the United States of America up to 75% of adults older than 75 years have been diagnosed with hypertension with numbers being slightly lower in Europe [<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295976.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The Joint National Committee (JNC8) defined hypertension as an elevated systolic blood pressure over 140 mmHg or elevated diastolic blood pressure over 90 mmHg [<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Different observational studies showed an association between higher blood pressure and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality [<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295976.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, low blood pressure is considered a protective factor for different diseases, such as CVD, renal insufficiency [<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], retinopathy [<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and death, which is why hypertension should be treated [<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295976.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The treatment of hypertension in oldest-old patients is receiving greater attention, as the number of individuals within the oldest old age group within the general population is increasing rapidly as life expectancy increases. In this patient group, however, intensive blood pressure control and antihypertensive treatment can lead to overtreatment and treatment-related complications.</p><p>Different observational studies suggest that the positive relationship between high blood pressure and mortality is weakened in oldest-old adults [<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For instance, a recent study showed that older frail adults with high systolic blood pressure (SBP) had a lower risk of all-cause mortality, suggesting that high SBP may be protective [<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Further, the use of antihypertensive treatment increases adverse effects, such as dizziness, vertigo and falls [<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Different studies showed that blood pressure lowered by antihypertensive treatment is considered a risk factor for first time falls and also recurrent falls in nursing home residents and in older adults living in assisted living in serviced apartments [<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295976.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. One of the most commonly observed adverse effects from antihypertensive treatment and low blood pressure are falls and fall-related injuries [<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Study results from the PARTAGE study showed a higher mortality risk for nursing home residents who took multiple blood pressure medications and achieved systolic blood pressure levels below 130 mmHg [<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. According to a report published by the World Health Organization [<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], falls are a major public health problem in particular because they are associated with an increased mortality [<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, the prevention of falls is of importance. However, the evidence on the association between falls and blood pressure in the oldest-old adults remains unclear.</p><p>In addition, the role of antihypertensive treatment on falls in oldest-old adults remains unclear. On the one hand, these medications may lead to changes in electrolyte levels or orthostatic hypotension, which could lead to falls in older adults [<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. On the other hand, there is evidence that antihypertensive treatment may improve cerebral blood flow and carotid distensibility and thus reduce the risk of falling [<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295976.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. To contribute to filling the current research gaps, the aim of this study was to study the association between systolic blood pressure (SBP) and incident falls in oldest-old adults and to analyze whether this association is modified by the use of antihypertensive treatments or a history of cardiovascular disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Setting</title><p>For this study we used the data from the Leiden 85-plus Study, a prospective population-based cohort study of inhabitants of the city of Leiden in the Netherlands [<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295976.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. As reported elsewhere, between September 1997 and September 1999 the study team enrolled 705 inhabitants of the city in the month of their 85<sup>th</sup> birthday [<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295976.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. There were no exclusion criteria applied. From the target population of 705 inhabitants, 14 (2.0%) died before enrolment and a total of 566 participants gave their informed consent (or proxy consent was obtained) and were enrolled into the study [<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In the present analyses, from the participants who provided informed consent to participate in the Leiden 85-plus Study, the data of 544 participants with any information on incident falls and blood pressure were analysed (96% of the cohort). As part of the Leiden 85-plus Study, participants were visited twice for face-to-face interviews and clinical examinations one month after their 85th birthday at the start of the study [<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and yearly thereafter with a follow-up of five years.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Definitions of key variables and covariates</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Blood pressure</title><p>Blood pressure was measured yearly for all participants up to the age of 90 years. During these home visits, blood pressure was measured twice in a seated position with a mercury sphygmomanometer. Before measurement the participants were resting for at least five minutes and had not been exercising in the preceding 30 minutes. For the data analysis the mean of both measurements was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Falls</title><p>The participants were followed-up for falls each year during a follow-up period of five years. At baseline and during the annual follow-up visits, the general practitioners or nursing home physicians were questioned about the medical history of the participants including their history of falls with medical consequences. For the present analyses, we used falls as a binary outcome (min. 1 falls vs. no falls).</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Antihypertensive treatment</title><p>Pharmacists provided a detailed listing of the medications used by participants. Antihypertensive treatment was defined using ATC (Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical) code groups. All medications included in the ATC code Group C02 (antihypertensives) were defined as antihypertensive treatment. Medication use was documented at baseline and during follow-up. For the present analyses, antihypertensive medication use was defined as a binary variable (use vs. no use) in each year of follow-up. We did not use any information on medication dosages.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Other variables</title><p>Sociodemographic variables were recorded during the study visits (gender, education, income, living situation). For subgroup analyses the presence of CVD was documented (yes/no). CVD was defined as a diagnosis of either angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, heart failure, intermittent claudication, peripheral arterial surgery, transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>We used descriptive statistics to report baseline characteristics of our sample stratified by antihypertensive treatment. The longitudinal data with one entry per year was modelled using generalized linear mixed effects models with a binomial distribution and a logit link function. We used falls as a binary outcome (yes/no), the time-updated SBP as a fixed covariate, and added a random intercept for the participants to account for the correlation structure in the data. For the main analysis, we assumed a linear effect of SBP on the log odds for falls and the results are presented as multiplicative change in the odds for falls for an increase in SBP by 10 mmHg. As sensitivity analyses, to test whether the direction of the association was stable across the spectrum of mmHg values, we fitted piecewise linear models for SBP using linear splines with one or two knots and adjusted for the year of follow-up. For subgroup analyses, we added further covariates to the models including the time-updated intake of antihypertensives, history of CVD (at baseline) and death within the study, and their interaction with blood pressure. Further we stratified for frailty defined as lower than median hand grip strength or not able to perform a hand grip. Missing data was handled via the mixed effects models. All participants with non-missing information on blood pressure and falls on at least one time point were included in the main analysis. For participants who died or dropped out of the study, all observations up to the time point of death or drop-out were included. For all analyses we used Stata 16.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title><p>The Medical Ethical Committee of the Leiden University Medical Center approved the original Leiden 85-plus Study.

We found that above the threshold of 130mmHg lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) values were associated with a higher risk of falling with the odds for falls decreasing by 0.83 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.91) per 10 mmHg. Below 130mmHg there was no such association (odds ratio: 1.35, 95% CI 0.81 to 2.26). In participants with and without antihypertensive treatment, the probability of falling decreased with higher blood pressure, particularly above SBP values of 130 mmHg. In the subgroup of participants without a history of CVD, the association between blood pressure and the probability to fall was more pronounced than in participants with a history of CVD. Overall, the results tend to point toward a possible benefit of higher systolic blood pressure in the age group of the oldest-old adults on the risk of falling.</p><p>In our study, we observed a lower risk of falling compared to other studies [<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295976.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. One potential explanation for this discrepancy lies in the limitations of our study, which included only falls with medical consequences. This selective inclusion of falls with medical outcomes may have led to the observed lower risk, as it excludes less severe or non-medically relevant falls.</p><p>Our results are in line with previous studies on the association between systolic blood pressure and falls. For example, Klein [<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] found, in a study with participants aged &#x02265;60 years, an association with a decreased risk of falls in women with high blood pressure. At the same time, other observational studies point in the direction of low blood pressure being disadvantageous for older-old adults with regards to other patient outcomes. For instance, different studies showed that lower systolic blood pressure is associated with greater mortality in older adults aged 85 and over [<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295976.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>There remains a lot of uncertainty around the ideal SBP targets in oldest-old adults. M&#x000fc;hlbauer studied the literature relating to pharmacotherapy of hypertension in frail older patients and found conflicting results of randomized controlled trials and non-randomized studies, resulting in an absence of evidence-based recommendations. Nevertheless, the authors recommend that in patients over 80 years of age with a gait speed of less than 0.8 m/s target blood pressure values of 150 mmHg should be aimed for while in patients who are not more than mildly frail blood pressure values of 130-139mmHg should be aimed for [<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Based on various studies, there is inconclusive evidence about the relationship between blood pressure and falls in different subgroups. For instance, a study from Sweden found that blood pressure and fall risk varied by functional status in patients over 60 years old [<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In participants without functional impairment, high blood pressure was associated with a higher risk of falls. Low blood pressure was associated with an increased probability of falls in older adults with functional impairment. Similarly, in a Chinese community of older adults with an SBP over 140 mmHg, Song found frailty to be a risk factor for falls [<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Furthermore, the before mentioned study by Klein was able to show a gender-specific difference [<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In persons 60 years and older the effects of hypertension on reducing falls risk were only observed in women. In contrast, low blood pressure levels (BP&#x0003c;120/80 mmHg) were associated with increased fall risk in men.</p><p>Different studies investigated the association between antihypertensive treatment and falls. However, most previous research was done in &#x02018;younger&#x02019; populations of older adults compared to the study population in our analyses (&#x02265;85 years). Similar to our findings, Zachary did not find an overall association between the use of antihypertensive treatment and recurrent falls in participants aged 70&#x02013;79 years [<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A meta-analysis from 2013 did not find an association between the use of any antihypertensive treatment and an increased risk of fall injuries in the oldest old either [<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, a case-crossover study with over 90&#x02019;000 participants, found a short-term, but no long-term increased risk of fall injuries after antihypertensive treatment initiation in participants &#x02265;65 years old [<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Similarly, Tinetti et al. [<xref rid="pone.0295976.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] found a significant association between the use of antihypertensive treatment and an increased risk of serious fall injuries. These findings seem to differ from ours. While we investigated the risk of falls with medical consequences that were reported by participants and their general practitioners, they defined serious fall injuries based on emergency department visits recorded in claims data. This difference, together with the possibility that participants in our study may have used antihypertensive treatment for a longer period and those with falls may have already stopped it, may be one reason for the different results.</p><sec id="sec018"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>With a high inclusion rate and almost complete follow-up, this study benefits from being based on a population-based sample of oldest old adults. The generalisability of this study is further enhanced by including data from participants living in nursing homes and not only community-dwelling older adults. Further, it is strengthened by the fact that the study design allowed to establish a temporal relationship between time-updated SBP values measured and outcome assessments over the follow-up of five years.</p><p>We would like to highlight some limitations. First, this is an observational study with data collected from 1997 onwards and therefore has limitations due to its study design. For example, the relationship between exposure and outcome may be biased or confounded by unmeasurable or uncontrollable factors (such as orthostatic hypotension or psychotropic medication for example). However, our sensitivity analyses show similar results. Secondly, we assumed data missing at random in the mixed-effects models. That might not be the case, especially for missingness due to death. Survivorship bias therefore cannot be excluded. However, we did not find any evidence that death during the follow-up period would modify the effect of blood pressure on falls. The third limitation was the focus on falls with medical consequences that were reported by general practitioners, which may have led to an underestimation of the overall number of falls. Since falls were assessed yearly, there was a maximum time delay of one year for recording a fall. Finally, a lack of continuous drug monitoring and absence of dosing information are other limitations of this study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The findings of this study demonstrate that above the threshold of 130 mmHg lower systolic blood pressure values are associated with a higher risk of falls with medical consequences in adults aged 85 years and older independent of the use of antihypertensive treatment. Again, the effect was present in the group with SBP above 130 mmHg but not below. Our results thus point towards a possible benefit of higher blood pressure in the oldest-old with respect to falls.</p></sec><sec id="sec020" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0295976.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 File</label><caption><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0295976.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0295976.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Gu</surname><given-names>Q</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Burt</surname><given-names>VL</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Dillon</surname><given-names>CF</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Yoon</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>. <article-title>Trends in antihypertensive medication use and blood pressure control among United States adults with hypertension: the National Health And Nutrition Examination Survey, 2001 to 2010.</article-title>

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)<!-- </font> --></p><p>Reviewer #1:&#x000a0;With interest I have read the manuscript.</p><p>In my opinion, the manuscript may benefit from an elaboration of the authors regarding the limitations of their study design by comparing their findings with other published data. For example, only 15% of the study sample experienced at least one fall. Data show that 30-40% of adults older than 65 years fall yearly (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/0003-4819-157-3-201208070-00462" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/0003-4819-157-3-201208070-00462</ext-link>). In their study in the oldest-old, only 15% had reported to have fallen in the previous year. This is a large difference that should be emphasized more.

Where is this based on? Falls are multifactorial in nature, and it seems like some major fall-risk factors such as orthostatic hypotension, frailty/dependence, and non-antihypertensive concomitant medications (e.g., psychotropic medications: <ext-link xlink:href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40266-014-0225-x" ext-link-type="uri">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40266-014-0225-x</ext-link>) are not considered?</p><p>Also, reading the manuscript, reflection on potential differences between antihypertensive (sub)classes in associations with fall risk (e.g., <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525861017306989" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525861017306989</ext-link>) are missing. Was it possible to do subgroup analyses based on antihypertensive (sub)class?</p><p>Is it possible to calculate time to first fall and/or number of falls instead of any fall during follow-up? This may be more informative.</p><p>Lastly, I would like to advice the authors to thoroughly review the main text of the manuscript for typo's (e.g., person instead of persons in lines 270-271), odd phrasing (example lines 163-164 "in older patients with functional status greater than 60 years old"), omissions (line 80: "values" missing before blood pressure?) and duplications (example: "however" in lines 76-77).</p><p>**********</p><p><!-- <font color="black"> -->6.

We appreciate your suggestion to elaborate on the limitations of our study design and to compare our findings with other published data. We have taken your feedback into account, and in our revised manuscript, we have included a discussion of the observed differences in fall rates between our study and existing literature. In our conclusion and key points, we specifically tailored the text to highlight falls with medical consequences (as measured in our study), acknowledging and addressing this distinction to provide a more nuanced interpretation of our findings, which may contribute to the observed lower risk of falling compared to other studies.</p><p>Manuscript Change: The text on p. 13, Line 290-294 now reads: </p><p>In our study, we observed a lower risk of falling compared to other studies. One potential explanation for this discrepancy lies in the limitations of our study, which included only falls with medical consequences. This selective inclusion of falls with medical outcomes may have led to the observed lower risk, as it excludes less severe or non-medically relevant falls.</p><p>The text on p. 2 Line 64-66 now reads:</p><p>We found that above the threshold of 130mmHg higher systolic blood pressure values were associated with a lower risk of falls with medical consequences in oldest-old adults, independent of the use of antihypertensive medications.</p><p>The text on p. 16 Line 381-383 now reads:</p><p>The findings of this study demonstrate that above the threshold of 130 mmHg lower systolic blood pressure values are associated with a higher risk of falls with medical consequences in adults aged 85 years and older independent of the use of antihypertensive treatment.</p><p>Comment 2:</p><p>In addition, the authors have only corrected for a small list of confounders without justification of the selection. Where is this based on? Falls are multifactorial in nature, and it seems like some major fall-risk factors such as orthostatic hypotension, frailty/dependence, and non-antihypertensive concomitant medications (e.g., psychotropic medications: <ext-link xlink:href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40266-014-0225-x" ext-link-type="uri">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40266-014-0225-x</ext-link>) are not considered?</p><p>Response: </p><p>We agree with the reviewer&#x02019;s comment that several factors can lead to a fall. However it is not possible to correct for each and every one. We therefore needed to select confounders that are a) relevant and b) available in the dataset. As described on page 7, we chose beside socio-economic characteristics factors like the presence of a cardiovascular disease (CVD) and allowed our models to analyse time-updated information of antihypertensive medication. Because we do not have time-updated data on orthostatic hypotension or psychotropic medication we updated our limitations section. However, we can include a stratification for frailty where the results did not differ for patients with or without frailty (frailty defined as lower than median hand grip strength or not able to perform a hand grip). </p><p>This leads to the following changes:</p><p>Manuscript Change: The Text on p.7 Line 183-184 now reads:</p><p>Further we stratified for frailty defined as lower than median hand grip strength or not able to perform a hand grip.</p><p>The Text on p.11 Line 255-257 now reads:</p><p>The results remained similar when adjusting the models for the year of follow-up (S5 Fig) and for frailty (S7 Fig).</p><p>The Text on p. 15 Line 353-356 now reads:</p><p>For example, the relationship between exposure and outcome may be biased or confounded by unmeasurable or uncontrollable factors (such as orthostatic hypotension or psychotropic medication for example). </p><p>Comment 3:</p><p>Also, reading the manuscript, reflection on potential differences between antihypertensive (sub)classes in associations with fall risk (e.g., <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525861017306989" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525861017306989</ext-link>) are missing. Was it possible to do subgroup analyses based on antihypertensive (sub)class?</p><p>Response: We appreciate your comment and the suggestion for subgroup analyses based on antihypertensive subclasses. </p><p>It's important to note that our study was not specifically designed to delve into the nuances of different types of blood pressure-lowering medications. One contributing factor to this decision is the common practice of prescribing these medications in combination, making it challenging to attribute effects to individual subclasses accurately. Also, one would need to incorporate dosage, dosage over time and other factors such as kidney function. Our primary focus was on understanding the broader relationship between blood pressure levels and falls within the limitations of the available dataset however in a highly representative cohort with time-updated information on blood pressure and a long follow-up. </p><p>Furthermore, it's worth noting that creating subgroups based on antihypertensive subclasses would likely result in small sample sizes, limiting the statistical power and reliability of any conclusions drawn in this context.</p><p>Thank you for your understanding and consideration. </p><p>Comment 4:</p><p>Is it possible to calculate time to first fall and/or number of falls instead of any fall during follow-up? This may be more informative.</p><p>Response: The information on falls was collected annually without dates. Therefore we chose to annually analyze data on falls. </p><p>Comment 5</p><p>Lastly, We would like to advice the authors to thoroughly review the main text of the manuscript for typo's (e.g., person instead of persons in lines 270-271), odd phrasing (example lines 163-164 "in older patients with functional status greater than 60 years old"), omissions (line 80: "values" missing before blood pressure?) and duplications (example: "however" in lines 76-77).</p><p>Response: Thank you for your valuable feedback. We have carefully reviewed the manuscript and addressed the issues you pointed out, including typos, odd phrasing, omissions, and duplications. We have made the necessary revisions to enhance the clarity and quality of the text.</p><p>Manuscript Change: </p><p>The text on p.14 , Line 466-468 now reads: </p><p>In persons 60 years and older the effects of hypertension on reducing falls risk were only observed in women.</p><p>The text on p.14 , Line 320-322 now reads: </p><p>For instance, a study from Sweden found that blood pressure and fall risk varied by functional status in patients over 60 years old.</p><p>The text on p.4 , Line 88-89 now reads: </p><p>Different observational studies suggest that the positive relationship between high blood pressure and mortality is weakened in oldest-old adults.</p><p>The text on p.4 , Line 85-87 now reads: </p><p>In this patient group, however, intensive blood pressure control and antihypertensive treatment can lead to overtreatment and treatment-related complications.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0295976.r003" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0295976.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mogi</surname><given-names>Masaki</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2023 Masaki Mogi</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2023</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Masaki Mogi</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0295976" id="rel-obj003" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
