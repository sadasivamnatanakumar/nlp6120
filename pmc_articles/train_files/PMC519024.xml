These forces have been noted as an early event leading to liver restoration in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]; however, the idea that quality of the blood rather than quantity has been the accepted dogma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Based on time-scale events, shear stress inflicted on liver cells precedes the expression of factors some of which are expressed within minutes. Studies conducted in recent years indicate that shear stress induced NO leads to the expression of genes participating in liver regeneration including c-fos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. There is evidence demonstrating that increase of c-fos in PHx or portal branch ligation models is inhibited by N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, which blocks NO synthase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The present study was undertaken to examine the molecular and ultrastructural effects of hemodynamic forces on LECs. We have chosen to focus on vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) receptors (VEGFRs), as these are present on endothelial cells and have been demonstrated not only to have a role in liver regeneration, but also to be affected by shear stress conditions. Following PHx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], VEGF is expressed in periportal regions demonstrating lobular heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, as well as Tie 1, Tie 2 and platelet-derived growth factor, are all shown to increase in endothelial cells following PHx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We have demonstrated the stimulatory effects of both VEGF-165 and VEGF-121 on liver cell proliferation following PHx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In a recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], it was shown that shear stress causes the induction and translocation of VEGFR-2 to the nucleus in bovine aortic endothelial cells. In addition, it promotes the formation of a complex comprising VEGFR-2, VE-cadherin and &#x003b2;-catenin. It is postulated that the complex acts as a shear stress receptor, mediating signals into the cells. Here, we describe the relationship between elevated blood flow to the liver following PHx and the morphology alterations associated with lining endothelial cells. We also provide evidence demonstrating that shear stress imposed on LECs <italic>in vitro </italic>is accompanied by a significant increases in VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2 and neuropilin-1 mRNA levels. Furthermore, following shear stress both receptors alternate from perinuclear and faint cytoplamic orientation to adhere to cytoskeletal components and cell membrane. These changes coincide with the behavior of the adherence junction proteins VE-cadherin and &#x003b2;-catenin.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Portal blood flow following liver hepatectomy</title><p>Seventy percent of PHx is associated with cell proliferation and a gradual increase in liver mass (data not shown). Nine days post-hepatectomy close to 80% of the original liver weight was restored. PCNA labeling index peaked at 48 hrs thereby returning to preoperative values. Concomitant with liver resection an immediate increase in blood flow to the remnant liver was evident, reaching a maximum of 2.5 fold at 24 hrs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Special emphasis was given to the influence of these forces on the surface of liver sinusoids and intactness of the endothelial lining.</p><p>Under normal conditions, liver lobule sinusoids show an intact endothelial lining, consisting of LECs with flattened processes perforated by small fenestrae. These fenestrae measure 0.15&#x02013;0.2 &#x003bc;m in diameter and are arranged in groups, sieve plates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). As early as ten minutes post hepatectomy, endothelial changes were already noted in the form of fused fenestrae (gaps), ranging in size between 0.3 &#x003bc;m and 2 &#x003bc;m (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). These gaps were more prominent in periportal than pericentral areas (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

The sinusoid was patent and empty; the wall of the sinusoid was composed of a thin layer of fenestrated endothelium covering the space of Disse, filled by microvilli extending from the parenchymal cell surface. These parenchymal cells contained glycogen, a few lipid vesicles, and numerous organelles in their cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). Ten minutes after hepatectomy, many blood platelets adhered to the endothelial lining. In addition, the endothelial lining became disrupted as represented by the occurrence of gaps and microvilli, which were facing directly toward the sinusoidal lumen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). These morphological alterations were still present 24, 72 and 168 hrs after PHx. Lipid accumulation in the form of droplets could be observed in the cytoplasm of parenchymal cells 10 hrs (data not shown) after partial hepatectomy, persisting until day 3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d</xref>).

Following 4 hrs of incubation at 37&#x000b0;C and extensive washing, the cells demonstrated nuclear localization of NF&#x003ba;b suggesting an active state. To avoid activation, purified LECs were grown in feeding medium containing 0.25% FCS for 4 hrs, extensively washed and left for 12 hrs before further used. Under these conditions, more than 94% of the cells exhibited cytoplasmic NF&#x003ba;b which was re-localized to the nucleus following shear stress (data not shown). LECs displayed perinuclear and cytoplasmic localization of VEGFR-2 and neuropilin 1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Following exposure to shear stress conditions (10 dynes/cm<sup>2</sup>/15 minutes), a strong cytoplasmic presence was evident, with a clear tendency to adhere to cytoskeletal components.

Some of these genes increase within moments after PHx; others increase hours post-surgery. Regardless of the timeframe, the most obvious change occurring immediately after PHx is an elevated in hemodynamic forces imposed on liver cells. Those changes are the result of an increase in the ratio of blood flow to liver weight. We documented a 2.5 fold increase in portal blood flow following 70% PHx. These changes occur immediately and persist for a number of days.</p><p>Endothelial cells lining liver sinusoids are likely to be the first to sense changes in shear stress. Those cells are unique as they have no typical basal lamina. Moreover, the cells are fenestrated allowing free passage of chylomicrons, lipoproteins, hormones, growth factors and proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The size and density of these fenestrae are affected by physical factors, such as portal pressure and shear stress, as well as soluble factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Exploring the effects of shear stress on LECs <italic>in vivo </italic>is, at the moment, beyond our reach. Therefore, the present study examines the effects of increased blood flow following PHx on the morphology of LECs. We also follow the gene expression and protein distribution in LECs exposed to controlled shear stress <italic>in vitro</italic>. These forces mimic to the best of our ability physiological conditions.</p><p>Following 70% PHx an immediate ultrastructural change was noted in the form of fused fenestrae and gaps. Their number increased significantly in both periportal and pericentral areas (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>); yet, expressed differently in both zones (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). This observation is not surprising in light of other zonation gradients reported for many liver functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], like fenestration pattern, differential expression of receptors, hepatocyte metabolism, and ECM-distribution in the space of Disse. Different high-resolution microscopic methods have shown that gaps may originate from the fusion of several fenestrae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In fact, gaps along the endothelial lining have been noted when different sample preparation methods were applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] or be induced by hepatotoxins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and high-perfusion pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In accordance with our observation, Wack et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] reported a gradient behavior in porosity between periportal and pericentral areas following 70% PHx, surprisingly though the gradient described by those authors persists only at 5 minutes and 24 hrs post-surgery. In this study, diameter determinations on gaps were omitted making full comparison difficult. In our experiments, we could not detect statistical variations in the size of gaps between the two zonal areas (our unpublished data). This could be explained by the fact that the size of gaps varied between 0.3 &#x003bc;m and 2 &#x003bc;m and mean values with large standard errors were obtained, excluding therefore valuable statistical analysis.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Number of gaps along the sinusoidal endothelial lining following partial hepatectomy</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center"><bold>Time</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Periportal (zone 1) n gaps / 10 &#x003bc;m</bold><sup>2</sup></td><td align="center"><bold>Pericentral (zone 3) n gaps / 10 &#x003bc;m</bold><sup>2</sup></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">Control</td><td align="center">0.10 (0.14)</td><td align="center">0.06 (0.12)</td></tr><tr><td align="center">10 min</td><td align="center">1.57 (0.74)*</td><td align="center">0.33 (0.13)<sup>&#x000a7;</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="center">24 hrs</td><td align="center">1.47 (0.66)*</td><td align="center">0.47 (0.32)<sup>&#x000a7;</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="center">72 hrs</td><td align="center">2.18 (0.91)*</td><td align="center">0.84 (0.65)<sup>&#x000a7;</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="center">168 hrs</td><td align="center">2.28 (0.88)*</td><td align="center">0.79 (0.55)<sup>&#x000a7;</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="center">240 hrs</td><td align="center">0.09 (0.05)</td><td align="center">0.07 (0.05)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Morphometric analysis evaluating the number of gaps per area along the sinusoidal endothelial lining, studied by SEM.

The inconsistency between the number of gaps and the ratio of blood flow per mg of liver tissue, at later time, points may either reflect the time lapse required for liver tissue to recover or that portal pressure is not the only factor influencing lining endothelial cells. Consistent with the increased permeability in zone 1 and zone 2 following PHx, accumulation of lipid droplets was evident 10 hrs post surgery, persisting until day three. At the completion of liver regeneration, lipid content returns to normal values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Increased lipid uptake seems to correlate with the change in barrier competence presented by sinusoidal endothelial cells; however, the role it has in the regenerating liver is still to be elucidated.</p><p>Given the increase in blood flow to the liver immediately after PHx, it is likely that the "damage" caused to LECs is the result of excessive shear stress to which the cells are exposed. Interestingly, injections of large volume at a short time, hydrodynamic injections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] inflict periportal and pericentral damage in the form of large (fused) fenestra (our data to be published).</p><p>Shear stress conditions can artificially be applied using the cone and plate apparatus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. We have chosen to limit our observation to VEGF receptors as those were shown to be expressed on endothelial cells and their level changed during liver regeneration. Owing to the fact that neuropilin-1 acts as VEGF co-receptor, we have looked at neuropilin-1 expression following shear stress as well.</p><p>LECs exhibited nuclear staining of VEGFR-1. This localization was not affected by shear stress conditions. VEGFR-2 and neuropilin-1 present a similar pattern of perinuclear and faint cytoplasmic presence. Following shear stress conditions the two receptors seemed to adhere to membrane and cytoskeletal components.</p><p>Neuropilin-1 is an isoform specific receptor for VEGF-165 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], VEGF-E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], PLGF152 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and VEGF-B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Recent studies have demonstrated a complex dependent signaling involving VEGF-165, neuropilin-1 and VEGFR-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Such a complex was shown to exist on the surface of endothelial cells or between tumor cells and endothelial cells. Activation of VEGFR-2 has been shown to be involved in the formation of complexes with various cytoplasmic proteins including adherence junction proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Furthermore, nuclear translocation of VEGFR-2 along with caveolin-1 and eNOS was reported to occur following VEGF treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Consistent with data recently presented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], VEGFR-2 co-stains with VE-cadherin following exposure to shear stress. Our preliminary data point to the possibility of a large complex consisting of VEGFR-2, neuropilin-1 and the adherence junction proteins VE-cadherin and &#x003b2;-catenin; nonetheless, additional experiments need to be done before any conclusion can be reached. Coinciding with the intense staining of the above following exposure to shear stress are the increased mRNA levels of all three as detected by real time PCR.</p><p>Hemodynamic forces play a major role in restructuring blood vessels by modulating endothelial structure and functions such as increased permeability to macromolecules or damage to endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Therefore, a key question in liver regeneration is how these forces imposed during the early steps following resection are translated into gene expression, DNA synthesis and cell proliferation. Shear forces dependent signaling is presumably based on cytoskeletal components, which act as a mechano-transducer. Indeed, tyrosine phosphorylation of the endothelial cell adhesion molecule PECAM-1 is observed in response to flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, the present study documents an increase in blood flow to remnant liver following PHx. This change is associated with an elevated number of endothelial cell gaps in both periportal and pericentral areas. Shear stress <italic>in vitro </italic>induces in endothelial cells membrane translocation of VEGFR-2 and neuropilin-1. It is conceivable that under shear stress conditions a complex consisting of VEGFR-2/neuropilin-1 and adhesion molecules forms. Such a complex may well be formed following the elevated blood flow associated with partial hepatectomy, playing a role in the early signals leading to liver regeneration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals and surgical procedures</title><p>Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 300&#x02013;325 g were used. PHx was performed on 5 animals under light anesthesia by removing the right lateral and median lobes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. At different time intervals animals were exsanguinated, the liver removed and tissue samples were prepared for immunostaining and RNA extraction. Animals undergoing PHx and analyzed by electron microscopy were anesthetized first by Ketamine and Xylasine followed by intubation with isoflurane 1.5%. Animals received humane care according to the criteria outlined in the "Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals" NIH publication.</p></sec><sec><title>Monitoring liver regeneration</title><p>Liver regeneration was monitored using liver mass and PCNA. Liver mass was calculated by weighing the removed lobes following surgery and the regenerating liver at the indicated time point. For PCNA immunostaining, specimens were fixed in paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin and sliced. Sections were incubated with anti-PCNA followed by biotin conjugated secondary antibody. The binding of anti-PCNA was monitored using avidin-peroxidase and amino ethyl carbazol as a substrate (Zymed, San Francisco, CA).</p></sec><sec><title>Blood flow</title><p>Five rats were anesthetized and placed on a temperature-controlled table. Following tracheotomy and saline infusion an ultrasound sensor was fixed to the portal vein. Portal blood flow was monitored by ultrasound flowmetry and automatically recorded (Ultrasonic System Inc. model T206, Ithaca, N.Y).</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of liver tissue for electron microscopy</title><p>Tissue samples were prepared according to standard protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Briefly, samples were cut into 1 mm<sup>3 </sup>blocks in 1.5% glutaraldehyde, in 0.12 M sodium cacodylate buffer. Following fixation, blocks were submerged in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in Epon. Semithin (1 &#x003bc;m) sections were cut and stained with 1% toluidine blue solution. For detailed EM-study, 50&#x02013;80 nm ultrathin sections were stained first with uranyl acetate and then with lead citrate. For SEM, dehydrated blocks were dried with hexamethyldisilazane and subsequently broken in liquid nitrogen, mounted on stubs and sputter coated with a thin layer of 20 nm gold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Morphometric analysis was performed on randomly acquired digitized SEM images at magnifications &#x000d7;5,000 or &#x000d7;20,000, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The UTHSCSA Image Tool 2.0 software was used to determine the number of liver sinusoidal endothelial gaps. Gaps, an empty area, a hole with a maximum diameter of &#x02264; 0.3 &#x003bc;m and &#x02264; 2 &#x003bc;m, were discriminated from fenestrae based on morphology and size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. For each experimental variable, 10 images in the periportal and pericentral zones (regions up to 100 &#x003bc;m in diameter) were randomly selected and captured at both magnifications. Three animals were tested at each time point. All experiments were repeated three times and data were expressed as mean (plus standard deviation of the mean).</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation of liver endothelial cells (LECs)</title><p>LECs were isolated using a modification of the procedure described by Braet et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and Smedsrod and Pertoft [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Briefly, the liver was washed and perfused through the portal vein with balanced salt solution and 0.05% collagenase A. Following excision and mincing, the cells were filtered and centrifuged. Enriched liver sinusoidal cells were then layered on a two-step percoll gradient (25/50%) and centrifuged for 20 minutes at 900 g. The intermediate, 25/50% zone is enriched with LECs and Kupffer cells. Following selective adherence of Kupffer cells, LECs were spread on collagen coated plastic slides for 4 hrs and extensively washed. Based on EM such cultures are estimated to be 95% pure.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro </italic>shear stress</title><p>LECs grown on plastic collagen-coated slides were subjected to shear stress forces produced between a stationary base plate and a rotating cone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].
