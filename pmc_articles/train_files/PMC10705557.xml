This assay allows us to characterize hundreds of thousands of unique PKR-K3 genetic combinations in a single pooled experiment. Our results highlight specific missense variants available to PKR that subvert the K3 antagonist. We find that improved PKR variants are readily available at sites under positive selection, with limited opportunity at sites interfacing with K3 and eIF2&#x003b1;. Additionally, we find many variants that improve and disable K3 antagonism, suggesting a pliable interface. We reason that this approach can be leveraged to explore the evolutionary plasticity of many other host-virus interfaces.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">Molecular interfaces between interacting host and pathogen proteins are atomic battlegrounds that give rise to evolutionary arms races (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Daugherty &#x00026; Malik, 2012</xref>).

This phenomenon is underpinned by the &#x02018;Red Queen Hypothesis&#x02019;, stating that constant adaptation between antagonistic interacting proteins is necessary to sustain their respective functions (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Van Valen, 1973</xref>). Here we investigate an ongoing evolutionary arms race between a component of our immune system, Protein Kinase R (PKR), and a vaccinia virus (VACV) pseudo-substrate antagonist, K3, both of which are under positive selection (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Elde et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Jacquet et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Rothenburg et al., 2009</xref>).

By systematically characterizing nonsynonymous variants we gain a general understanding of their evolutionary plasticity as well as a clear map of the functional and deleterious variants that are readily available.</p><p id="P3">PKR is a critical component of the human innate immune system (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Balachandran et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Clemens, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Metz &#x00026; Esteban, 1972</xref>; <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Williams, 1997</xref>). Expressed from the gene <italic toggle="yes">EIF2AK2</italic> (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 2, also referred to as <italic toggle="yes">PKR</italic>), it is composed of two N-terminal double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding domains and a C-terminal kinase domain, and the two are connected by an extended linker region (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Dar et al., 2005</xref>). PKR is one of four kinases that activates the Integrated Stress Response (ISR), ultimately inhibiting translation initiation to halt protein synthesis. Each kinase is activated by a distinct stress signal and converge by phosphorylating the same substrate, eIF2&#x003b1; (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit alpha) (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Chen &#x00026; London, 1995</xref>; <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Dever et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Galabru &#x00026; Hovanessian, 1987</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Hovanessian, 1989</xref>; <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 1998</xref>). PKR is constitutively expressed across all tissue types (GTEx Analysis Release V8, dbGaP Accession phs000424.v8.p2) but is not activated until it binds dsRNA, a general byproduct of viral replication (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et al., 1976</xref>; <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Weber et al., 2006</xref>). Upon dsRNA binding, PKR forms a homodimer, self-activates, then phosphorylates eIF2&#x003b1;. Phosphorylated eIF2&#x003b1; inhibits eIF2B, preventing the exchange of eIF2 GDP to GTP and disrupting translation initiation (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Hershey, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Kaufman, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Sudhakar et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, activated PKR curtails protein synthesis and</p><p id="P4">VACV K3, encoded by <italic toggle="yes">K3L</italic>, is a pseudosubstrate antagonist that is expressed by many poxviruses (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Beattie et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Haller et al., 2014</xref>). Poxviruses are large, dsDNA viruses that can infect most vertebrates and insects (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Harrison et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Moss, 2007</xref>). They replicate in the cytoplasm and generate dsRNA in the process (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Moss, 1974</xref>). To prevent PKR activation by dsRNA, most known poxviruses encode proteins whose dedicated function is to inhibit PKR. VACV K3, encoded by the gene K3L, is a PKR antagonist with homologs in many poxvirus genomes (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Beattie et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Haller et al., 2014</xref>). K3 mimics the natural substrate eIF2&#x003b1; and acts as a pseudosubstrate inhibitor of PKR (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Beattie et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Carroll et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Davies et al., 1993</xref>). Direct binding of K3 to PKR in place of eIF2&#x003b1; prevents eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation and aids viral replication by masking the virus from host PKR (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Beattie et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Elde et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Previous work has found both PKR and K3 to be under positive selection, with specific residues highlighted throughout PKR that are rapidly evolving (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Elde et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Jacquet et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Rothenburg et al., 2009</xref>).

These windows of interest are defined as Window 1: G255-F278, Window 2: K371-R385, Window 3: S448-M455, and Window 4: E480-I506. This selection criteria amounted to 374 missense variants, 31 nonsense variants, and an additional 4 synonymous variants (D260, G264, K371, V484) for a total of 409 variants across Windows 1&#x02013;4 (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figure S1</xref>).</p><p id="P8">In parallel, we designed a library of variants to explore the local evolutionary space available for K3 to antagonize PKR (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2C</xref>).

Multiple variant primers were pooled together in a single PCR reaction, such that the final PCR product contained a mix of gene fragments, each with a single variant.

To build whole-length genes from the gene fragment (PCR-1), each variant tile set PCR reaction was paired with a separate PCR reaction (PCR-2) that contained the rest of the target gene, the cloning vector sequence, and homology arms that complemented the PCR-1 fragment.

For example, the myxoma virus elicits very different sequela in brush rabbits and European rabbits. Brush rabbits are the natural hosts of myxoma virus, and the virus causes relatively benign, localized lesions (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Kerr &#x00026; Best, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Regnery &#x00026; Miller, 1972</xref>).

First, we designed and generated single residue, nonsynonymous variants of both <italic toggle="yes">PKR</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">K3L</italic> in a pooled format. We used a PCR-based strategy featuring variant primers to generate hundreds of variants of each gene in a pooled format. We aimed to link each variant to approximately 10 unique DNA barcodes that were identified by long-read sequencing. This approach allows us and others to systematically generate hundreds of specific genetic variants for unbiased screens, and that variant information can be compressed and localized to the barcode sequence using long-read sequencing. This compression step enables both high-throughput screening and the opportunity to combine variant alleles together, as we did with <italic toggle="yes">PKR</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">K3L</italic>. Finally, the existence of multiple barcodes per variant resulted in a pool with internal biological replicates.</p><p id="P24">Second, we merged two variant libraries into an extensive all-pairs library in which every <italic toggle="yes">PKR</italic> variant was paired with every <italic toggle="yes">K3L</italic> variant.

Our cloning strategy to combine variants resulted in a paired barcode in which the <italic toggle="yes">PKR</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">K3L</italic> barcodes are adjacent. We could then use short-read sequencing to track variant pairs over time, allowing the yeast growth assay to accommodate hundreds of thousands of variant combinations in a single flask. We expect that continued advances in sequencing technology will permit ever-larger combinatorial libraries to be screened, allowing broader evolutionary spaces to be explored.</p><p id="P25">This experimental approach can be pushed even further to characterize all-pairs of <italic toggle="yes">PKR</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">K3L</italic>.
