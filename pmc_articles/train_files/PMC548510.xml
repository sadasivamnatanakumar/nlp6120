The low incidence of infection at normal epithelial surfaces reflects the presence of innate, broad-spectrum antimicrobial defense mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Host defense peptides (HDPs) of the innate immune response play an important role in the protective barrier function of the epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Host defense peptides have been isolated from diverse organisms, including plants, insects, bacteria and vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Several classes of mammalian peptide antibiotics have been ascribed pivotal roles in innate immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Among these are various cysteine-rich peptides such as defensins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and the more structurally diverse cathelicidins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Produced as precursors, they require proteolytic processing to liberate the mature functional antimicrobial peptide. Cathelicidins contain a conserved N-terminal cathelin domain, and a structurally diverse C-terminal domain that possesses the peptide's antimicrobial activity. Rabbit CAP18 was the first cathelicidin precursor described, and its mature peptide has broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Cathelicidins have since been identified in many other species including hCAP18/LL37 in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], protegrins in swine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], CRAMP in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and SMAP29 in sheep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Many of these peptides demonstrate extremely broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, including Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria and fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In addition, they achieve bacterial killing much more rapidly than any commercially available antibiotic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Recently, a new family of synthetic, &#x003b1;-helical HDPs called "ovispirins" was described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Although some of these modified peptides had similar antimicrobial activity of naturally occurring peptides, they manifested appreciable cytotoxicity. We have demonstrated recently that variants of Ovispirin, the so called Novispirin peptides, displayed more favorable toxic/ therapeutic ratios <italic>in vitro </italic>and broad spectrum activity in infected rat burn model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Some of these peptides are induced at epithelial surfaces in response to invading organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Many HDPs kill microorganisms by causing membrane permeabilization, although not necessarily as their sole mode of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Some HDPs also direct chemotaxis, promote wound healing, angiogenesis and contribute to adaptive immunity by mobilizing memory T cells and immature dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Recent studies have also demonstrated antitumor activity after treatment with HDPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>In addition, several antiviral activities were reported. Recently it has been demonstrated that rabbit neutrophil peptide alpha-defensin NP1 protects cells from infection with HSV-1 and 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Other studies revealed that human neutrophil peptide HNP1 to 3 and Theta-defensins also inhibit HSV infection although by different mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The ancestral human theta-defensins retrocyclin blocked HSV attachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The inhibition of adenovirus replication by the antimicrobial peptide awaits identification of a mechanism of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Anti-HIV activity of defensins were first reported 1993 by Nakashima and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The alpha-defensins exhibited anti-HIV activity on at least two levels: directly inactivating virus particles; and affecting the ability of target CD4 cells to replicate the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Binding to gp120 of HIV-1 and inhibition of HIV entry has also been identified as the mechanism of inhibition of HIV infection by theta defensins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Due to their inhibitory effect on HIV-1 replication and due to an association of a single-nucleotide polymorphism in a beta defensin gene human beta-defensins might also play an important role in host defense against HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>The antibacterial activity of HDPs is largely mediated by pore formation leading to permeablization of the bacterial membrane. Although some selectivity for bacterial membranes has been described, the lipid membrane of enveloped viruses might also be a target of antimicrobial peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. This might allow development of antiviral effector molecules for topical application against a broad spectrum of enveloped viruses. Targeting host cell-derived membrane components might be a particularly interesting approach to inhibit viruses that rapidly develop resistance to compounds directed against viral proteins such as HIV. Therefore, we screened a panel of different natural occurring and designer HDPs for Env-independent inhibition of HIV infection at an early step in the viral replication cycle.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Given the potential cytotoxicity of HDPs, it was important to discriminate between modulation of cell metabolism and direct antiviral effects. We were concerned that HDPs could modulate host cell metabolism without affecting cell viability as assayed for example by standard MTT assays. We therefore decided to use immunodeficiency virus-based vectors transferring the luciferase gene to determine both, the HDP antiviral activity and modulation of cell metabolism. The luciferase activity of target cells, stably transduced with the lentiviral vector prior to HDP treatment should reveal any effect of HDPs on cellular transcriptional and translational efficacy. Treating cells with HDPs during infection with the lentiviral vector and comparison with results obtained with the stably transduced cells should then allow identifying HDPs that inhibit early steps in the viral replication cycle. To validate the luciferase-based assay for modulation of cell metabolism, 293 cells were stably transduced with a lentiviral vector transferring the luciferase gene. Incubation of transduced cells with increasing concentrations of Protegrin-1 and LL37 led to a dose-dependent inhibition of luciferase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Comparison to the MTT test revealed a similar dose response curve, although the MTT test might be less sensitive at lower concentrations of the HDPs. Testing cell proliferation by a BrdU incorporation assay revealed a threshold level above which proliferation is strongly reduced. To allow side by side evaluation of cytotoxic and antiviral effects of HDPs with the same read-out the luciferase-based assay was used in most subsequent experiments.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of different cytotoxicity assays. </bold>293A target cells stably transduced with the luciferase gene were incubated for 48 hours in the indicated concentrations of LL37 or Protegrin-1.

Stably transduced target cells were incubated in parallel with the HDPs to detect effects on cell metabolism. Luciferase activities were determined 2 days after infection. All HDPs led to a reduction in luciferase activity of cells transduced with the lentiviral vector (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;E</xref>), but most of them also reduced the luciferase activity of stably transduced target cells. Specific inhibition of early steps of infection was only seen for the cathelicidin LL37 and PG-1. As an additional control for the specificity of inhibition, a non-enveloped adenoviral vector transferring the luciferase gene was also incubated with the same panel of HDPs. None of the HDPs led to a dose-dependent inhibition of early steps of the adenoviral replication cycle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F&#x02013;J</xref>). Two-fold serial dilutions were used to determine 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC<sub>50</sub>) of LL37 and PG-1, resulting in IC<sub>50</sub>s of approximately 30 &#x003bc;g/ml and 16.8 &#x003bc;g/ml, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Inhibitory activity of HDPs against lentiviral and adenoviral vectors. </bold>Percent luciferase activity of 293A target cells transduced in the presence of the indicated amounts of HDP with the VL&#x00394;BH lentiviral vector (A to E) or an adenoviral vector (F to J) both transferring the luciferase gene is shown.

In addition, cells were first infected with the lentiviral vector for two hours prior to addition of the HDPs. LL37 and PG-1 exerted the strongest inhibition after preincubation of HDPs and the lentiviral vectors, indicating a direct effect on infectivity of the vector particles. However, adding LL37 and PG-1 two hours after incubation of cells with the lentiviral vector also led to a stronger reduction of luciferase activity than observed after incubation of cells stably transduced with the luciferase gene suggesting a second target in the infection cycle that is affected by LL37 and PG-1. To further discriminate between direct inhibitory effects on vector particles and effects mediated by potential HDP cell interactions lentiviral vector particles were first incubated with LL37 and PG-1 for 30 minutes and then added either undiluted or at a 1:10 dilution to the target cells. Due to a 10-fold lower HDP concentration in the latter cultures, vector infectivity should be reduced to a lesser extent, if inhibitory effects are mediated by cellular targets. Comparable dose-dependent inhibition curves (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C,D</xref>) of diluted and undiluted vectors demonstrate that the inhibitory effects of LL37 and PG-1 depend on the HDP concentration during preincubation of the vector particles and not on the HDP concentration during subsequent cell culture.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Time and concentration dependent inhibition of lentiviral vectors by LL37 and Protegrin-1. </bold>The lentiviral vector VL&#x00394;BH transferring the luciferase gene was either preincubated with 200 &#x003bc;g/ml of LL37 (A) or 50 &#x003bc;g/ml of Protegrin-1 (B) for 30 minutes (-30) or added simultaneously (0) with LL37 and Protegrin-1 to 293A target cells.

The BrdU incorporation assay was used to evaluate modulation of cell function. A dose dependent reduction of the titer of HIV-1 on P4CCR5 cells was observed for both HDPs. However, the IC<sub>50 </sub>of LL37 was approximately 3-fold higher than the IC<sub>50 </sub>previously determined for the lentiviral vectors resulting in a narrow gap between antiviral and antiproliferative effects of LL37. In contrast, the IC<sub>50 </sub>of PG-1 was below 10 &#x003bc;g/ml, while inhibitory effects on cell proliferation were not observed up to concentrations of 50 &#x003bc;g/ml.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Inhibitory effects of Protegrin-1 and LL37 on HIV-1 Env mediated vector entry (A, B) and HIV-1 infection (C,D). </bold>A lentiviral vector transferring the GFP gene (VG&#x00394;BH-SIN) was incubated at increasing concentrations of LL37 (A) or Protegrin-1 (B) prior to transduction of P4CCR5 cells.

The strongest inhibition was seen if the lentiviral vectors were preincubated with LL37 and PG-1. This suggests that these HDPs directly interacted with the vector particles, which is consistent with our observation that inhibition was dependent on the HDP concentration during preincubation of the vectors with HDPs, but not on the HDP concentration during infection of the cells. Since lentiviral vectors and retroviral vectors were inhibited to a similar degree although they do not share any viral protein, the target for the HDP on the particles is probably cell-derived. This could either be the lipid membrane derived from the cell, which surrounds the vector particles or cellular membrane proteins that are frequently incorporated in lentiviral and retroviral particles during budding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. A permeabilizing effect of LL37 and PG-1 on the viral particles would be consistent with our data, but other mechanisms of inhibition cannot be excluded. While the inhibitory effect of PG-1 was also detected with wild type HIV-1 on P4CCR5 cells, LL37 inhibited HIV-1 to lesser degree then the lentiviral vectors. Due an IC<sub>50 </sub>of 88 &#x003bc;g/ml against wild type HIV-1, it is questionable whether LL37 concentrations are sufficiently high at mucosal membranes to play a role in host defense against HIV-1.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Modulation of cell metabolism was generally seen at concentrations of HDPs exceeding 50 &#x003bc;g/ml, while the MEC of the antibacterial activity ranged from 1 to 10 &#x003bc;g/ml. This might leave a sufficient window for therapeutic intervention of bacterial infection. However, for the treatment of HIV-1, the therapeutic window of LL37 and PG-1 is rather narrow. It should also be noted that the HDP-induced modulation of cell metabolism and cytotoxicity can be cell type dependent. Therefore, increasing the selectivity of HDPs for early steps in the viral replication cycle seems to be necessary for further development of the human cathelicidin LL37 and the porcine Protegrin-1 as antiviral agents for systemic or topical applications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Preparation of vectors transferring the luciferase or GFP genes</title><p>To generate lentiviral vector particles transferring the luciferase gene, a codon-optimized (Geneart GmbH, Regensburg, Germany) HIV-1 <italic>gag-pol </italic>expression plasmid (Hgp<sup>syn</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and a VSV-G expression plasmid (pHIT-G) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] were used to package the SIV-based vector VL&#x00394;BH.
