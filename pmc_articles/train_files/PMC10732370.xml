With the renewables share growing globally, often driven by political pressures, the reliability and efficiency of power systems are increasingly affected by this dependency. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the natural variability of meteorological parameters on the European power system in 2030. We specifically focus on (1) analysing the main European weather patterns affecting renewable energy production and (2) understanding the co-variability of this production among European countries. The identification of a set of patterns in the behaviour of key power system operation indicators allows us to analyse the relationship between large-scale weather regimes and daily power system operations in a 2030 European energy context. Regarding renewable generation, analysis of the co-variability shows that European power systems tend to form two clusters, in each of which all the regions tend to show a positive correlation among themselves and a negative correlation with the other cluster. Our analysis of the most important large-scale weather regimes shows that during cyclonic patterns, the carbon intensity of all the European power systems is lower than normal, while the opposite happens during blocking regimes.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>Input data and the model outputs are available in the following two Zenodo repositories: 1. <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7065568" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7065568</ext-link> 2. <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7996208" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7996208</ext-link>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>Input data and the model outputs are available in the following two Zenodo repositories: 1. <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7065568" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7065568</ext-link> 2. <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7996208" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7996208</ext-link>.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>With the demand for sustainable energy on the rise, numerous governments and policy makers around the world are announcing pronounced ambitions to increase the share of renewable energy production in the electricity generation mix. In the European Union (EU), as part of the Fit for 55 package of proposals for delivering the European Green Deal, the Renewable energy directive puts forward a legal framework for the development of renewable energy across all sectors of the EU economy. The directive has been revised numerous times to accelerate the roll-out of renewables and reflect increasingly ambitious climate targets. In 2023, the EU agreed on a revised binding renewable target of 42.5% of gross final energy consumption [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>In the last twenty years, the European continent has seen a remarkable increase in renewable energy generation. The total capacity of renewable electricity generation in Europe went from 221 GW (with 13 GW of solar/wind) in 2000 to 725 GW (with 427 GW of wind/solar) in 2021 (+230%) [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. With most renewable production being difficult to predict by nature, dealing with the variability of renewable energy sources (RES) is still one of the biggest challenges for efficiently integrating low-carbon sources in power systems [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Since RES operations are tightly linked to weather (due to the availability of wind, sunshine or precipitation), understanding the impact of meteorological and climatic variables on electricity systems is becoming increasingly important for multiple stakeholders along the value chain, from utilities providing (ancillary) services to policy makers ensuring security of supply [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In general, introducing inter-annual variability into power system models can lead to more robust estimations of the storage capacity needed in systems with a high penetration of renewables [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Furthermore, assessing and quantifying the variability of electricity generation and related makes it possible to improve the design of low-carbon energy systems and increase the penetration of RES with power system reliability in mind.</p><p>There exists a growing stream of literature assessing the impact of climate variability and change on electricity systems and markets [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0289705.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Most articles, however, reflect on the impact of a specific climatic variable on one specific electricity system parameter. For example, previous studies analysing the impact of RES variability on European electricity systems have mostly focused specifically on wind and solar resources [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] or power system planning [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0289705.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Moreover, the majority do so by focusing on a specific country or region in an isolated manner, for example by analysing the sensitivity of the power sector to climate change (for example for different global locations [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Our paper aims to provide a more comprehensive assessment by analysing in an integrated future European energy context the impact of climate variability on power system operations and indicators, including generation from renewable energy sources (solar, wind and hydropower), demand, carbon dioxide intensity and cross-border flows.</p><p>The work addresses two different aspects: 1) co-variability among European countries and 2) analysis of the predominant weather-based patterns. The co-variability of power production from renewable sources in different areas has usually been studied with a focus on the complementarity between wind and solar [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Similar assessments extended to power systems operations are, however, not common [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Regarding weather patterns, we link the operations of European power systems to a set of specific large-scale weather conditions, using the patterns identified in [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and applied in successive works [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. While recent work has investigated the impact of weather patterns at a large scale [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], our analysis provides insights into the impacts of frequent patterns in a future European energy context. By associating the identified weather patterns with a configuration of the European power system, in terms of renewable energy generation, cross-border exchanges and other parameters, the analysis allows us to investigate the relationship between large-scale weather regimes and daily power system operations in a 2030 European energy context. As such, the work enables policy-makers to assess with efficiency the impact of climate variability in decarbonising electricity systems.</p><p>Below, we elaborate on the data and models used to perform our modelling analysis. Next, we discuss the impact of natural variability of meteorological parameters from three different perspectives: 1) measuring power system variability; 2) measuring the co-variability between regions and; 3) identifying patterns in the impact of weather regimes. We conclude by discussing the implications of our work for power system planners and policy makers.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>2. Data &#x00026; models</title><p>This paper investigates the impact of climate variability on wind, solar, hydropower generation and electricity demand in 34 inter-connected European power systems using a power system model based on the European Commission MIX 2030 scenario [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The MIX scenario is one of the European Commission&#x02019;s core policy scenarios from the Fit for 55 package [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It was produced as a common tool for analysis in the impact assessments of various initiatives in the European Green Deal policy package. This scenario is the central policy scenario, and it assumes an extended Emissions Trading System (ETS) in road transport and buildings, medium to high ambition for energy efficiency and renewable energy policies. It delivers emission reductions of 55% compared to 1990, reducing 2030 energy demand by around 9% compared to the REF 2020 scenario and reaching a share of renewables of 38.4%.</p><p>Climate variability is modelled using weather-driven inputs in the power system modeling (<xref rid="pone.0289705.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The selected inputs are the most significant factors in explaining how weather affects supply and demand: they include all the most important renewable energy sources and the electricity demand. Hydropower plays&#x02013;both today and in the EU 2030 scenarios&#x02013;a critical role in providing the seasonal storage of electricity.

The dataset consists of a statistical downscaling from the ERA5 atmospheric reanalysis [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] for the following energy variables: electricity demand (not used in this study), wind (on- and off-shore) and solar capacity factors, hydropower inflows and run-of-river generation.</p><p>The electricity demand data we used has been built following the methodology described in ([<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], Section 5.5). The methodology is based on the demand for all the European countries, disaggregating heating &#x00026; cooling (assumed to be little affected by meteorological conditions). Similarly to the PECD dataset, the electricity demand uses meteorological variables from the ERA5 atmospheric reanalysis.</p><p>The results shown in this study are based on 34 climate years: each climate year consists of a set of inputs for solar, wind, hydropower generation and electricity demand based on the historical meteorological data for the specific year. A climate year is a physically consistent set of synthetic time-series used as input for the power system model for solar generation, wind generation, hydropower generation and electricity demand. Basically, a climate year represents a what-if scenario, assuming the same installed capacity and technology. The use of climate years can be considered the best way to address the uncertainty derived from meteorological conditions. For example, the work by Collins et al. [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] uses climate years between 1985 and 2014 to analyse the inter-annual variability across Europe. Our approach covers not only wind and solar but also hydropower and demand, increasing the possibility to explain the complex interactions between climatic conditions and power systems operations. The use of climate information derived from ERA5 atmospheric reanalysis makes it possible to introduce interannual variability consistently for all the regions analysed [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We analyse the interannual variability of the selected inputs in the <xref rid="pone.0289705.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>.</p><p>The simulations in this study are conducted using the METIS power system model [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0289705.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. While the model is based on proprietary software, all the data that we have used&#x02013;as well as the results&#x02013;are freely available with an open license. The METIS model can simulate the hourly operations of energy assets over a year, minimising the system cost maintaining the supply/demand in each node. Each node of the model represents a country and the interconnector between countries can exchange electricity according to their net transfer capacity. METIS solves a linear economic dispatch problem including all the generation technologies specified in the MIX scenario (as described in [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]).

The hydropower inflow in the Iberian region shows a very high variability (as investigated for Spain in [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]) with a clear correlation with its net electricity export (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">s</italic></sub> 0.72 CI 95% [0.51, 0.85]), highlighting the capability of the Iberian region to provide low-carbon electricity to its neighbours (i.e., France, in the analysed scenario). Beyond hydropower, other renewable energy sources like wind and solar show relatively low variability, as the annual capacity factors for these sources can be predicted with relatively high precision [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>We further measure the relationship, as expressed with a linear regression, between the penetration of renewable electricity sources and emission intensity (<xref rid="pone.0289705.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). This analysis indicates how the variability of a specific source of electricity can affect the emissions of the regional power systems. As expected, we observe a strong relationship between the share of renewable energy sources in a region&#x02019;s electricity generation and the CO<sub>2</sub> intensity of that electricity. The magnitude of the effect is stronger for variable renewable energy sources wind and solar than for hydropower, related to the relative (in)flexibility of the generation source and its position in the merit order curve.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0289705.g002"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0289705.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Linear regression showing the relationship between penetration of electricity sources and the CO<sub>2</sub> intensity (measured in gCO<sub>2</sub>/kWh).</title><p> Only groups with linear regression p&#x0003c;0.001 are shown.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0289705.g002" position="float"/></fig><p>The results are in line with [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], who focus on the analysis of the variability of European power systems from a similar perspective, especially regarding the variability of CO<sub>2</sub> intensity and wind and solar generation. We observe two key areas of divergence in the literature affecting these power system variables: 1) the use of different scenarios (for example the European Commission MIX 2030 versus the ENTSO-E visions scenarios from the TYNDP 2016 in [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and 2) differing approaches to the variability of renewable energy sources (for example the lack of hydropower in [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] introducing major differences in the supply/demand balance in hydropower-rich regions.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>3.2 Co-variability</title><p>We define co-variability as how the change in one region relates to changes in the rest of the continent. Co-variability happens mainly for two reasons: 1) European power systems are inter-connected and can exchange electricity and 2) the meteorological phenomena influencing the power systems (e.g., wind lulls) are often large-scale, large enough to affect multiple regions (if not the entire continent) at the same time. The co-variability between two variables is measured using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient and, where necessary, a confidence interval of the value is calculated using a Fisher z-transformation, following the implementation provided by [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. We analyse the co-variability starting from the year-over-year variations of wind and solar generation (<xref rid="pone.0289705.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). We observe how the correlation in the northern regions (mostly wind-driven) shows a cluster, albeit less evident during summer. The southern regions (Iberia, Italy and SEE) are weakly correlated with each other and show a negative correlation with the northern regions. The strongest negative correlation is between Iberia and Northern, -0.49 (CI 95% [-0.84, -0.13]) during winter, and between CEE and Iberia, -0.45 (CI 95% [-0.78, -0.12]) throughout the year.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0289705.g003"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0289705.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Year-over-year Spearman correlation of wind and solar generation for the entire year or for summer/winter.</title><p>The colours and size of the edges between the nodes is based on the value of the Spearman correlation coefficient.

This is consistent with <xref rid="pone.0289705.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> as well as with other results found in scientific literature [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0289705.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. For wind generation, we can observe negative correlations between the two clusters: for example, Iberian and Northern show a correlation of -0.53 (CI 95% [-0.83, -0.22]), Italy and Northern -0.50 (CI 95% [-0.84, -0.16]) and Italy and UK &#x00026; Ireland -0.47 (CI 95% [-0.77, -0.16]). We further observe that solar power also shows a positive correlation among multiple regions but it is, in general, weaker than wind.</p><p>In terms of other indicators, emission intensity is positively linked in many regions, in particular in UK &#x00026; Ireland and CWE (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">s</italic></sub> = 0.87, CI 95% [0.78, 0.95]) and CWE with CEE (<italic toggle="yes">r</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">s</italic></sub> = 0.90, CI 95% [0.83, 0.98]). Indeed, with emission intensity directly connected to the availability of low carbon/renewables sources, the availability of renewables is correlated across most of the regions. Situations with higher/lower RES generation thus lead to lower/higher emissions and can span multiple regions, if not the entire continent. Finally, the panel on net export (i.e., the difference between export and import at annual level) shows two things:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>a) Some regions (often neighbours) can simultaneously experience an increase/decrease of electricity exports, meaning that their supply tends to vary year-over-year with a similar pattern</p></list-item><list-item><p>b) The negative correlation can be seen as a natural implication of electricity trading, but it may also suggest that when a region tends to have a deficit of low-cost electricity another one has a surplus and vice versa.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>3.3 Patterns</title><p>Weather phenomena affecting European power systems can have a large-scale impact on power systems, i.e., simultaneously affecting multiple countries or even the whole continent. These phenomena can be recurrent and persistent, with similar patterns leading to similar impacts on power systems. A way to assess those patterns is through the analysis of weather regimes. Weather regimes are a classification of recurrent weather states and have been used effectively in many applications, including the analysis of energy systems [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0289705.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0289705.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>In this work, we use a classification introduced by [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], to study the deployment of wind energy in Europe and applied in consequent works, as for example in [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0289705.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We use the patterns identified by Grams for the first time for the analysis of power systems operations; previous work based on this classification has focused mostly on wind.</p><p><xref rid="pone.0289705.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref> shows the seven different weather states over Europe in this classification, computed through a clustering algorithm on the observed meteorological daily data for the period 1979&#x02013;2015. While this classification has been identified for a winter period, it can be associated with year-round phenomena [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The regimes are calculated using the geopotential height anomaly on ERA-Interim atmospheric reanalysis and make it possible to characterise large-scale weather conditions that might affect renewable energy generation and power systems operations in general. Three of the seven identified regimes can be associated with the so-called cyclonic-type regime: Atlantic trough (AT), Zonal regime (ZO) and Scandinavian trough (ScTr). A cyclonic regime is often associated with windy conditions in northern Europe and mild temperatures in general. The remaining four weather regimes are &#x02018;blocking&#x02019; regimes: Atlantic Ridge (AR), European blocking (EuBL). Scandinavian Blocking (ScBL) and Greenland Blocking (GL). The blocking regimes normally bring calmer winds, and colder temperatures prevail. A different pattern is associated with each day, allowing us to investigate the average deviation of the analysed variables from their normal values.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0289705.g005"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0289705.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>The weather regimes used in this study introduced in (Grams et al., 2017).</title><p>The composite shows the mean 500-hPa geopotential height anomaly in the winter months.

The emission intensity is clearly linked with the availability of wind power, as clearly visible in the patterns AT and ScTR where an increased availability of wind is associated with lower emissions across the entire continent. The same reversed pattern is visible in EuBL.</p><p>Consistently with the results in [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], we find opposing behaviour for wind power between the northern regions (Northern, CWE, CEE, UK &#x00026; Ireland) and southern areas (Italy and Iberia) for most of the weather patterns, in particular between the ZO and GL patterns. Indeed, wind and solar power consistently take up opposing positions across most of the patterns, although the variability of solar power is clearly weaker than that of wind.</p><p>Some of the patterns are associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The NAO is the most important European weather phenomenon and plays a very important role in shaping the pattern of energy-relevant variables across the continent (for an in-depth analysis, we refer the reader to [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]). In the patterns that can be associated with a positive state of the NAO&#x02014;as the Atlantic Trough (AT), Zonal Regime (ZO) and Scandinavian trough (ScTr)&#x02013;there is an increase of wind power in the north and a decrease in the south. Conversely, for the pattern Greenland Blocking (GL), that can be associated with a negative state of NAO, Italy and Iberia show an increase in wind power of between 5% and 15%, with a decrease in the rest of the continent.</p><p>We further observe an anti-correlation between variable renewable energy generation and regions associated with the various weather patterns. For example, in the region CWE (428 GW of installed wind and solar), the daily generation of wind and solar is 54 GWh more than the average during the AT pattern, and -37 GWh during the EuBL pattern (<xref rid="pone.0289705.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). The difference between the two patterns, chosen as the most distant in terms of renewable generation, is less marked in the other regions. Moreover, as also mentioned in [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], the figure highlights that the EuBL/AT patterns do not seem to have any impact on wind and solar generation in the SEE region. This is in contrast to the CWE region. In general, as shown in <xref rid="pone.0289705.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref>, wind generation in SEE seems to exhibit behaviour that does not correlate with the other regions.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0289705.g007"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0289705.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>Difference (in GWh) of daily and wind generation across Europe during the patterns Atlantic Trough (AT, orange) and European Blocking (EuBL, green) for the European regions.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0289705.g007" position="float"/></fig><p>For hydropower inflow, the regions tend to show the same sign of change in general, with the notable exception of the pattern EuBL, where CEE, SEE and Iberia shows an increase (particularly large in Iberia &#x0003e;35%) and Northern and UK &#x00026; Ireland a decrease. A reversed pattern, albeit with a weaker signal, can be observed for ZO.</p><p>Analysis of the association between large-scale weather regimes and daily power systems operations shows how multiple patterns can affect the entire continent. Our results regarding the wind and solar power generation in each analysed pattern are consistent with the results shown in [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] (for wind) and in [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] (for both wind and solar). In three of the identified patterns (AT, ScTR, EuBL), all the European regions show the same sign of daily generation of wind and/or solar while in the other three patterns, northern and southern regions exhibit opposing behaviours.</p><p>During cyclonic patterns, the carbon intensity of electricity is generally lower across the whole continent, while the opposite happens during blocking regimes. This is partially due to the importance of wind in providing carbon-free electricity to the continent, which is mostly installed in central-western countries which tend to have stronger winds during cyclonic regimes [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>4. Discussion and conclusions</title><p>This study analyses the impact of year-on-year variability of weather and large-scale weather patterns on the 2030 European power system as envisioned in the MIX scenario of the Fit for 55 policy package of the European Commission. The scenario assumes that 75% of the total installed power generation capacity and 65% of all electricity generated in the EU comes from renewable sources. In electricity systems with such a high dependence on variable renewable generation, characterising the variability is important for several reasons:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To evaluate possible seasonal supply/demand scenarios and ensure the efficient operation of seasonal storage levels for electricity generation (mostly hydropower reservoirs in the scenarios analysed).</p></list-item><list-item><p>To assess the importance of climatic variability for power system planning purposes. As discussed in [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], when using a single year, the capacity expansion optimisation may be highly dependent on the chosen climatic conditions.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To assess power system dynamics during the most prevalent weather patterns in order to consistently link an event (e.g., reduced availability of renewable resources) in one region with the same event in other regions. Furthermore, the results suggest the possibility of using weather patterns to predict power systems&#x02019; variables using seasonal/sub-seasonal forecasts in Europe as already explored by [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0289705.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p></list-item></list><p>Our findings are, as such, of relevance to various audiences involved in the analysis of the European power system, ranging from researchers, to energy system planners and policymakers.</p><p>First, for energy system planners, for example for system operators, power generation companies or national regulatory authorities, the climate variability and co-variability are essential to consider for the robust configuration and dimensioning of the power system. To provide for system adequacy, planning decisions need to incorporate variability at the system level over an appropriate time. Moreover, the patterns of co-variability shown in this study offer opportunities for complementarities in system planning that could be realised as synergies through network planning or could result in enhanced revenue and risk hedging opportunities for market participants.</p><p>Indeed, we find power systems operations between two or more European regions to be largely correlated. While co-variability is, in general, stronger between neighbouring regions, we also find an evident correlation between some distant regions: for example, the Iberian peninsula and the Northern region exhibit a negative correlation for wind generation, net demand and net export of electricity. Such co-variability is important for system planners as its impact on the design of resilient energy systems may be fundamental to improving the integration of renewable energy sources into European power systems [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Our results are among the first to show the comprehensive effect of weather patterns on European power system dynamics. While the results for wind generation are consistent with [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], our findings also create insights into cross-border electricity exchanges and the electricity demand. The results thereby show how the use of power system models enables the quantification of the daily variability of the main energy variables, including aspects of importance for energy system planning purposes (e.g., curtailment and storage operations). Second, for policymakers, the results offer insights into the potential impact on power systems of the transition towards clean primary and mostly variable renewable energy supply. This calls for anticipatory policy and regulatory design as the increasing variability will accompany changes in capacity utilisation and hence also the economics of power system assets. For example, in the recently adopted electricity market design reformation, the European Commission recommends enhanced flexibility in future European power systems in order to accommodate variability in demand and supply patterns, as these are highly dependent on climatic variables [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This study is therefore intended to engage policymakers in order to ensure that the impact of climate variability on power system security is adequately assessed.</p><p>We find coupling between regions to be at the same time potentially beneficial and a threat to system adequacy and security of supply. For example, the negative correlation of hydropower generation between two regions means that one of the two regions can potentially supply the flexibility needed by the other region with lower levels of water in its hydropower reservoirs. On the other hand, a positive correlation of renewable sources (e.g., wind power) might mean that low-wind periods are potentially extended to multiple regions, leading to large-scale supply/demand issues.</p><p>Climatic conditions are not the only source of uncertainty but, especially in systems with large shares of renewable energy generation, they are a key contributor. Variability of production and demand play an important role in the methodology for the short-term and seasonal adequacy assessment described in the EU directive, depicting a common approach for all EU states for electricity crisis prevention [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Finally, we note that the presented projection of climate variability to future scenarios does not consider the effects of climate change, which is known to have a significant impact on European power systems In further analysis, we will consider future changes in atmospheric circulation that may have an impact on weather patterns, leading to possible changes in frequency and persistence [<xref rid="pone.0289705.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec008" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0289705.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 File</label><caption><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0289705.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors want to thank Kostas Kavvadias for his support in setting up the modelling framework, Christian Grams for sharing the weather patterns data and Catriona Black for her careful editing.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0289705.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">European Commission.

The researchers describe the variability of some model outcomes when the input data (renewable generation, and load) is based on different climatic years. It also describes how distinct regions correlate with each other in this regard. Finally, the impact of several known weather patterns on power system operations is described.</p><p>As a general remark, much greater attention should be paid to situating this work within the existing literature.</p><p>Note: page numbers of article start from 7, not 1.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1. Overall it seems like the paper was written somewhat hastily, without sufficient proofreading. Please improve.</p><p>2. Abstract presents only motivation and methodology, please also present major findings and key messages or at the very least suggestions for the possible impact or use of this work and why (as you do on p.20 &#x02013; 21).</p><p>3. The description of the contribution of this work could also be made more clear in the beginning of the paper.</p><p>4. p.8, l41 - Collins et al 2018 did not investigate climate variability in a planning context! They use a dispatch (= operational model).</p><p>1. Please compare your results to those of Collins et al 2018.</p><p>5. More generally, the insights gained from the analysis of weather patterns are not distinguished from the existing literature: What are the lessons learned here, that were not yet found in other works?</p><p>6. p. 5, performance metrics</p><p>1. Please compare your performance metrics to those of Collins et al 2018.</p><p>2. Peak load is very uninformative for adequacy / reliability purposes. Peak net load (load &#x02013; RES generation) or peak load net of power injection (load &#x02013; generation + storage + demand response dispatch) would be more informative.</p><p>7. Could you comment on how this variability impacts member states ability to reach targets?</p><p>8. Model description is lacking. Please provide a brief but clear description of the model that is being used: temporal resolution, power flow approximation, technologies included, ..</p><p>9. Datasets can be described better. Data quality is of utmost importance for this type of analysis, yet no information is given on how the climatic variability has been correctly integrated in the datasets that have been used. I suggest to create an extra section in the paper that focuses on Data and Model description.</p><p>1. p.8, Results &#x02013; this includes description of the data and performance metrics, which should be in a separate Methodology section. Similarly some sections of the Introduction section could be moved there.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1. p.7, l24-25 &#x02013; how much of that capacity is variable RES (as opposed to e.g. biomass)?</p><p>2. p.8 l.77 &#x02013; please mention that the data is open source here (if I understood correctly).</p><p>3. The introduction states that the work covers two different aspects: 1) the co-variability among the European countries and 2) the identification of the predominant weather-based patterns. But then later in the paper, it is mentioned that the weather patterns have been taken from another manuscript, and this paper merely describes their influence on power system operation</p><p>4. Could you elaborate on the parameters that you have chosen, why these and not others? E.g. curtailment, load shedding, line usage rates, ..</p><p>Formatting:</p><p>1. Paragraphs are very short, sometimes just a single sentence. This makes for unnecessarily difficult reading.</p><p>2. Some very grammatically incorrect sentences e.g. &#x0201c;The change of CO2 intensity shows that during with the patterns AT, ScTr, Ar and EuBL the low-carbon generation across Europe seems following the same trend:&#x0201d; Please have a native English speaker check the paper.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;Althouhg I find the topic interesting I think that given taht it seems you are referring to a long time span of years, just a descriptive statistics is not enough to describe the dataset. I would need to see the time evolution plots of the variables under study, so as to see at least if these series are stationary or not. Additionally you mention that the data is available but (maybe it was my fault) but I couldn't find it.</p><p>At least a descriptive analysis but taking into account that the data is evolving over time is needed for the paper being published.</p><p>**********</p><p><!-- <font color="black"> -->6.
