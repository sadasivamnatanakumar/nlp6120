In this work, we focused on its direct role during phage and bacterial host development. We observed that in many aspects, this phage sRNA resembles herpesviral microRNAs. Similar to microRNAs, the mature 24B_1 is a short molecule, consisting of just 20 nucleotides. It is generated by cleaving the 80-nt long precursor transcript, and likely it undergoes a multi-step maturation process in which the Hfq protein plays an important role, as confirmed by demonstration of its binding to the 24B_1 precursor, but not to the 24B_1 mature form. Moreover, 24B_1 plays a significant role in maintaining the prophage state and reprogramming the host&#x02019;s energy metabolism. We proved that overproduction of this molecule causes the opposite physiological effects to the mutant devoid of the <italic toggle="yes">24B_1</italic> gene, and thus, favors the lysogenic pathway. Furthermore, the 24B_1 overrepresentation significantly increases the efficiency of expression of phage genes coding for proteins CI, CII, and CIII which are engaged in the maintenance of the prophage. It seems that through binding to mRNA of the <italic toggle="yes">sdhB</italic> gene, coding for the succinate dehydrogenase subunit, the 24B_1 alters the central carbon metabolism and causes a drop in the ATP intracellular level. Interestingly, a similar effect, called the Warburg switch, is caused by herpesviral microRNAs and it is observed in cancer cells. The advantage of the Warburg effect is still unclear, however, it was proposed that the metabolism of cancer cells, and all rapidly dividing cells, is adopted to convert nutrients such as glucose and glutamine faster and more efficiently into biomass. The availability of essential building blocks, such as nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids, is crucial for effective cell proliferation which in turn is essential for the prophage and its host to stay in the lysogenic state.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

Stx phages bear many similarities in the life cycle and genomic organization to bacteriophage &#x003bb;, the most-investigated member of this family [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296038.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The Stx phage lifecycle begins when the phage adsorbs to the surface of the host bacteria and injects its linear double-stranded DNA into the cell. At this stage, depending on the intracellular conditions, phage may develop according to one of two alternative pathways, lysogenic or lytic [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296038.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. When the lysogenic pathway is chosen, phage DNA is incorporated into <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">coli</italic> genome (forming a prophage), replicated together with the bacterial genome, and then transmitted to daughter cells during cell division. The excision of the phage genome occurs following prophage induction. This may be caused by different factors like UV, antibiotics, or hydrogen peroxide that is naturally produced in the human body [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. As a consequence, viral DNA starts to replicate separately from the host bacterial chromosome as an extrachromosomal element [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296038.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This leads to the synthesis of phage structural and lysis proteins. In effect, the assembly of multiple new phage particles, disruption of the bacterial host cell, and release of large amounts of Shiga toxins and Stx progeny phages occur [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296038.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The progressive production of Shiga toxins causes bloody diarrhea as the first symptom of human infection. Other symptoms like abdominal pain and vomiting may also occur. Symptoms of food poisoning maintain around 10 days, however, 15&#x02013;20% of patients infected with these pathogens progress to severe complications such as hemolytic uremic syndrome, thrombocytopenia, or hemorrhagic colitis. Children under five years old and the elderly are most susceptible to severe complications with mortality as high as 87% [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The main problem of human infection by STEC is a lack of known effective treatment strategies. There is serious doubt of using antibiotics, as they are prophage inducers that indirectly stimulate the expression of genes coding for Shiga toxins and consequently, enhance the severity of disease symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296038.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The severity of the infection and the development of complications depend on the amount of Shiga toxin produced by bacteria. Importantly, the expression of <italic toggle="yes">stx</italic> genes is tightly linked to lytic development which starts after prophage induction. Otherwise, during lysogeny, the majority of phage genes (including these coding for Shiga toxins) are suppressed. In general, the switch between lysogenic and lytic pathway is based on the activation and inactivation of the major phage repressor of the lytic development (called CI in the case of lambdoid phages). This DNA-binding repressor is involved in the inhibition of the transcription from the main phage promoters <italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub>L</sub> and <italic toggle="yes">p</italic><sub>R</sub>. The binding of the repressor to the operator sites is a well-known mechanism of negative regulation that inhibits transcriptional initiation and thus suppresses the expression of the genes essential for the lytic cycle, synthesis of toxins, and phage lytic development at all. Before a phage enters the lytic pathway, repressors must be inactivated [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The best known mechanism responsible for the inactivation of the phage repressors in lambdoid phages involves the host SOS system that can be induced by physiological changes in the host cells, UV light irradiation, hydrogen peroxide treatment, or antibiotics. In most cases, the inducers of the SOS response cause DNA damage which results in the activation of the RecA protein and subsequent degradation of both the bacterial LexA protein and the phage-encoded CI repressor. The second mechanism to control the repressor activity uses phage-encoded antirepressor protein (frequently called Ant) which acts through the competitive binding with the repressor to the same operator-binding site. Some of the identified antirepressor genes are under the direct control of the LexA, however, some reports indicate that also small non-coding RNAs may be involved in this regulation. For example, the Ant antirepressor synthesis is regulated during the development of bacteriophage P22 by the small antisense RNA named Sar. Notably, this sRNA molecule acts in <italic toggle="yes">trans</italic> by binding to the ribosome binding site of the Ant mRNA and inhibits Ant production at a post-transcriptional level [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296038.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Similarly, in phage N15 which is a temperate virus of <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">coli</italic> related to lambdoid phages, the antirepressor gene is negatively regulated by a small RNA, named CA [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Recently, our group discovered 24B_1, a 20-nt microRNA-like molecule, after induction of Shiga toxin-converting bacteriophage &#x003a6;24<sub>B</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Importantly this molecule has been shown to stimulate the lysogenic pathway of phage lifecycle in <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">coli</italic> bacteria. We speculated that 24B_1 may act as a regulator of D_ant antirepressor gene expression and thus indirectly control the activity of the repressor of the phage lytic cycle. Previously, we have tested aspects of the development of bacteriophage &#x003a6;24<sub>B</sub> bearing a deletion of the sequence encoding the 24B_1 precursor molecule, that is located between genes <italic toggle="yes">lom</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">vb_24B_43</italic> of the &#x003a6;24<sub>B</sub> phage genome. The obtained results indicated that the lytic developmental pathway was more efficient in the mutant phage lacking the 24B_1 molecule [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These promising results prompted us to take a closer look at the 24B_1 role during the phage development in bacteria. In this report, we decided to analyze the influence of the overproduced 24B_1 molecule on the development of the phage as well as its host. Manipulation of the phage lysogenic-lytic decision through microRNA-like particles offers a new way to understand developmental pathways and identify possible therapeutic interventions against pathogenic <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">coli</italic> infections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Bacterial strains, bacteriophages, and plasmids</title><p><italic toggle="yes">E</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">coli</italic> MG1655 strain and its derivatives employed in this work, are presented in <xref rid="pone.0296038.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.

Within the citric acid cycle, NAD<sup>+</sup> is an electron carrier.

The apical portion of the 24B_1 precursor RNA hairpin is stably base-paired, and, hence, would not be expected to bind this protein.

In bacteria, these sRNAs have a profound impact on various processes such as virulence, colonization ability, motility, and cell growth or death [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Similarly, in the case of phages, they play vital roles during the early stages of infection, maintaining the state of lysogeny and suppressing the expression of late structural genes [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296038.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>The small RNA molecule, 24B_1, investigated in this work and originating from the Stx phage, deserves special attention in this context. While other microRNA-size, phage-encoded regulatory RNAs have not been described yet, similar molecules are well-documented in viruses that infect eukaryotic cells, particularly herpesviruses [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296038.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Notably, this sRNA shares several similarities with herpesviral microRNAs. Importantly, like Stx phages, herpesviruses undergo two distinct stages in their lifecycle and are able to cause latent or lytic infections and switch between these states. Similar to phage lysogeny, viral latency represents a specialized form of persistent infection where most viral genes remain silenced. Herpesviruses can reactivate and transit to the lytic stage, leading to host cell lysis and the production of infectious viral progeny, which spreads to new cells [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>Comparable to the identified herpesviral microRNAs, 24B_1 is a very short RNA molecule, only 20 nucleotides in length, produced through the cleavage of a precursor (80-nt long) transcript and likely undergoing a multi-step maturation process. Importantly, only the precursor form of 24B_1 binds the bacterial RNA-binding protein called Hfq (<xref rid="pone.0296038.g010" ref-type="fig">Fig 10</xref>). The functional roles of Hfq in sRNA action are fairly well understood and widely described in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296038.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296038.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296038.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] however, we show for the first time that this protein is able to bind the precursor form of phage 24B_1 molecule. On the other hand, the performed analysis did not confirm the binding of the short (20-nt long) 24B_1 with Hfq protein. This result suggests that similar to microRNAs produced in eukaryotic cells, different proteins may participate at the particular stages of maturation and operation of such small RNA molecules in prokaryotic cells. Furthermore, like most identified herpesviral microRNAs, 24B_1 demonstrates limited complementarity with its identified target&#x02014;the <italic toggle="yes">sdhB</italic> gene and actively promotes the phage&#x02019;s lysogenic state, which was confirmed under 24B_1 deletion and overproduction conditions (this work). Importantly, the imperfect pairing of the SdhB transcript to the 24B_1 seed region can be compensated by extended pairing interactions with the 3&#x02019; end of the 24B_1 molecule, and this phenomenon is also quite frequently observed in the case microRNAs functioning in eukaryotic cells [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>In herpesviruses, small regulatory RNAs classified as microRNAs have been identified as key players in the maintenance of viral latency [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The examples are miRNAs of the murine gammaherpesvirus-68 (MHV-68) which contribute to the maintenance of latent infection <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. The investigation of mutated viruses has unveiled that the presence of MHV-68 miRNAs are not necessary for the short-term replication of the virus, but they play a crucial role in establishing a persistent infection within memory B cells, ensuring a lifelong presence [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In turn, miRNAs of Kaposi&#x02019;s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), such as miR-K12-11 and miR-K12-3, prevent lytic reactivation by reducing the expression of cellular transcription factors MYB, C/EBP&#x003b1;, and Ets-1 [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296038.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The prevailing model suggests that during latency, viral microRNAs are expressed at relatively high levels, facilitating this phase of infection and thus negatively impacting the expression of lytic genes. Otherwise, during the lytic cycle, the transcripts liberate from inhibition by these microRNAs and changes occur in their transcriptional activity. As a result, although most virus-encoded microRNAs are present and detectable during the lytic phase, their role becomes diminished during this stage of infection [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Interestingly, as described by us previously [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], the 24B_1 sRNA has been identified during phage lytic development, 80 minutes after prophage induction with mitomycin C. What is more, similar to viral microRNAs, the 24B_1 sRNA plays a significant role in maintaining the phage in the form of prophage. This is supported by previous results obtained for <italic toggle="yes">24B_1</italic> phage deletion mutant [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and also under conditions of 24B_1 overexpression (this study). Here, we demonstrate that an excess of the 24B_1 molecule in the cell leads to a decrease in the efficiency of bacterial culture lysis after infection with Stx phage, and thus an increase in both the number of cells that survived the infection with phage, as well as the number of lysogens among survivors. The physiological effects were accompanied by increased levels of <italic toggle="yes">c</italic>I, <italic toggle="yes">c</italic>II, and <italic toggle="yes">c</italic>III mRNAs which protein products are strongly associated with the lysogenic pathway. Importantly, this effect seems to be indirect as we did not find significant binding sites for the 24B_1 molecule within these genes. In this regard, the 24B_1 small RNA closely resembles eukaryotic microRNAs of viral origin.</p><p>In the context of persistent viral infections, the role of miRNAs encoded by herpesviruses is of utmost importance, influencing various aspects such as the metabolic processes in host cells [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Notably, miRNAs of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and KSHV disrupt the balance of metabolic processes through direct targeting of key proteins or indirect regulation of multiple signalling pathways. Recent research has shed light on the impact of several EBV miRNAs on metabolic processes of cancer cells. For instance, the expression of miR-BART1 significantly upregulates the levels of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) in an NPC cell line called CNE1 [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. PHGDH is a critical enzyme involved in the synthesis of serine and glycine, central metabolites that play essential roles in various biosynthetic pathways [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Regarding KSHV, it has been observed that viral miRNAs affect host cell energy metabolism through the regulation of multiple pathways. Firstly, KSHV miRNAs stabilize and activate the transcription factor HIF1&#x003b1;-a master regulator of cell metabolism, by targeting EGLN2, a hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase. Secondly, KSHV miRNAs downregulate the mitochondrial heat shock protein A9 (HSPA9), which leads to a decrease in mitochondrial copy numbers and promotes anaerobic glycolysis (commonly known as the Warburg effect). The downregulation of EGLN2 and HSPA9 enables cancer cell proliferation even under low oxygen conditions [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In the field of oncology, the Warburg effect refers to the phenomenon observed in many cancer cells, where energy production primarily relies on anaerobic glycolysis rather than the typical citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation occurring in the mitochondria of normal cells. This process involves high glucose uptake, followed by glycolysis and lactic acid fermentation in the cytosol, even in the presence of ample oxygen. While fermentation produces ATP with lower efficiency compared to the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, it allows proliferating cells to utilize nutrients like glucose and glutamine more effectively for biomass production. Besides, it allows for bypassing the catabolic oxidation of nutrients into CO<sub>2</sub> and thus promotes anabolic processes [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296038.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Surprisingly, the overproduced 24B_1 molecule seems to induce a similar effect in prokaryotic cells. As we have shown in this work, its overproduction caused a decrease in the level of ATP and fumarate, but stimulated an increase of NAD<sup>+</sup>, which is most likely not converted to NADH. This is most likely due to the negative regulation of the succinate dehydrogenase subunit gene (<italic toggle="yes">sdhB</italic>) by 24B_1 as <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> binding of these two RNA transcripts has been observed. Sdh is the enzyme that participates in the citric acid cycle converting succinate to fumarate and takes part in the aerobic electron-transport pathway to generate energy <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> oxidative phosphorylation, thus is essential for the aerobic utilization of carbon sources. As reported recently, the Arg244His mutation in the amino acid sequence of the SDHB subunit attenuated ATP production and reduced mitochondrial number in <italic toggle="yes">Caenorhabditis&#x02008;elegans</italic>. These Arg244His SDHB mutants demonstrated elevated lactate/pyruvate levels, pointing to a missense-induced, Warburg-like aberrant glycolysis. Authors concluded that mutation in the amino acid sequence of SDHB rewires metabolism, resembling metabolic reprogramming in cancer [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Similar observations have been reported by other scientists who showed strong evidence that some mutations in SDH impair oxidative phosphorylation, which highly contributes to the Warburg metabolism switch observed in cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The advantage of the Warburg phenomenon in cancer cells has been unclear however it was proposed that the metabolism of cancer cells, and indeed all proliferating cells, is adapted to facilitate the uptake and incorporation of nutrients into the biomass (e.g., nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids) needed to produce a new progeny of cells. Thanks to this, cancer cells metabolize nutrients in a manner conducive to proliferation rather than efficient ATP production [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Does the presence of the prophage in a bacterial cell cause a similar effect? Recent results obtained by Holt and collaborators [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] showed that integration of phage &#x003a6;24<sub>B</sub> into bacterial genome increases cell proliferation. When grown under normal conditions, both the single and double <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">coli</italic> lysogens exhibited a considerable increase in cell numbers (exceeding 200%) compared to the MC1061 strain without &#x003a6;24<sub>B</sub> prophage [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Phage-mediated metabolic reprogramming of the bacterial cell was also presented by [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. The authors showed that infection of the marine bacterium <italic toggle="yes">Pseudoalteromonas</italic> with PSA-HP1 phage alters central carbon and energy metabolisms. Their findings indicate that the glyoxylate shunt was used in phage-infected cells instead of the classical citric acid cycle. Importantly, all <italic toggle="yes">sdh</italic> genes (<italic toggle="yes">sdhABCD</italic>) were downregulated 40 and 60 minutes after phage infection [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p><p>Undoubtedly energetic status is a significant modulator of lysogeny. The presence of a low ATP concentration within the intracellular environment creates a favorable condition for the accumulation of phage repressors of the lytic cycle. This condition not only promotes phage integration during new infections but also contributes to the persistence of existing prophages [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Host proteases, which rely on ATP for their proteolytic activity, serve as sensors of the cell&#x02019;s energy status and are regulated by cyclic AMP [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. When intracellular ATP levels are high due to an abundant energy supply, the host proteases cleave the phage repressors expressed early in the infection, thus favoring the lytic cycle [<xref rid="pone.0296038.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Thereby, the lysogeny dependence on the host&#x02019;s energetic metabolism and ATP amount is obvious. In this light, the observed pro-lysogenic role of the microRNA-size 24B_1 molecule takes on a new meaning. It seems that similar to herpesviral microRNAs, 24B_1 reprogrammes the host energy metabolism by altering the central carbon pathway and thus decreasing the cellular ATP level. The target site for the 24B_1 molecule appears to be the succinate dehydrogenase subunit gene <italic toggle="yes">sdhB</italic>, whose dysfunction may lead to disruption of the classical citric acid cycle and trigger the activation of an alternative pathway, characterized by the production of a smaller amount of ATP. In effect, the phage CI repressor is not cleaved by proteases and inhibits the phage lytic development in the bacterial cell thus maintaining the lysogeny state. This mechanism of action of the 24B_1 molecule on phage and host development seems to be highly probable in a light of the results presented in this work.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec028"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In many aspects (such as size, presence of the precursor form, and occurrence of a multi-step maturation process) the phage non-coding RNA molecule, named 24B_1, resembles herpesviral microRNAs.

This is the first report demonstrating molecular mechanisms of functions of a microRNA-size RNA molecule of the phage origin.</p></sec><sec id="sec029" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0296038.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>The growth kinetics of <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">coli</italic> bacteria in the presence of 0.4 mM (&#x025cf;) and 0.8 mM (&#x025b2;) concentrations of IPTG.</title><p>Control <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">coli</italic> bacteria (&#x025a1;) were cultured without the addition of IPTG.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0296038.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0296038.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>A representative NMR spectrum for metabolic changes in <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">coli</italic> bacteria induced by the overproduced 24B_1 sRNA.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0296038.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0296038.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>The visualization of the potential interaction occurring between SdhB transcript and 24B_1 molecule performed by the IntaRNA program.</title><p>The 24B_1 molecule is located at the bottom, whereas the target mRNA is at the top of the illustrated interaction.
