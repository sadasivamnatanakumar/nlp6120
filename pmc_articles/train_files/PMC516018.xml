In hepatocytes, keratin 8 and 18 (K8/18) are believed to play a protective role against mechanical and toxic stress. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and glycosylation are thought to modulate K8/18 functions. Treatment of mouse with a diet containing griseofulvin (GF) induces, in hepatocytes, modifications in organization, expression and phosphorylation of K8/18 IFs and leads, on the long term, to the formation of K8/18 containing aggregates morphologically and biochemically identical to Mallory bodies present in a number of human liver diseases. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between the level and localization of the stress inducible heat shock protein 70 kDa (HSP70i) and the level and localization of K8/18 phosphorylation in the liver of GF-intoxicated mice. The role of these processes in Mallory body formation was studied, too. The experiment was carried out parallely on two different mouse strains, C3H and FVB/n.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>GF-treatment induced an increase in HSP70i expression and K8 phosphorylation on serines 79 (K8 S79), 436 (K8 S436), and K18 phosphorylation on serine 33 (K18 S33) as determined by Western blotting. Using immunofluorescence staining, we showed that after treatment, HSP70i was present in all hepatocytes. However, phosphorylated K8 S79 (K8 pS79) and K8 S436 (K8 pS436) were observed only in groups of hepatocytes or in isolated hepatocytes. K18 pS33 was increased in all hepatocytes. HSP70i colocalized with MBs containing phosphorylated K8/18. Phophorylation of K8 S79 was observed in C3H mice MBs but was not present in FVB/n MBs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results indicate that GF intoxication represents a stress condition affecting all hepatocytes, whereas induction of K8/18 phosphorylation is not occurring in every hepatocyte. We conclude that, <italic>in vivo</italic>, there is no direct relationship between GF-induced stress and K8/18 phosphorylation on the studied sites. The K8/18 phosphorylation pattern indicates that different cell signaling pathways are activated in subpopulations of hepatocytes. Moreover, our results demonstrate that, in distinct genetic backgrounds, the induction of K8/18 phosphorylation can be different.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Intermediate filaments (IFs) with microtubules and actin microfilaments are the major cytoskeletal components of most vertebrate cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. IF proteins constitute a large family of proteins that is divided into five types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The expression of the different IF proteins is differentiation and tissue specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Keratins expressed in epithelial cells, represent the largest and most complex subtype of IF proteins (more than 20 proteins)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. They are classified into two groups, the type I (acidic K9 to K20) and the type II (neutral-basic, K1 to K8), which form obligate heteropolymers composed of equimolar amounts of type I and type II keratins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>It is now generally accepted that, in multilayered epithelia, one of the function for keratins IFs is to protect the tissue from mechanical stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The first evidences for this function came from studies on epidermis, which showed that transgenic mice lacking epidermal keratins, or expressing mutated keratins, displayed blistering skin disease phenotypes, similar to human skin diseases such as epidermolysis bullosa simplex or epidermolytic hyperkeratosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>As for epidermal keratins, the production of transgenic mice targeting K8 or K18 has been necessary to unravel the role of IFs in simple epithelium such as in the liver. In hepatocytes, K8/18 is the only keratin pair and thus both keratins are necessary to form an IF network. Transgenic mice expressing K8 or K18 carrying mutations that affect filament formation, develop mild hepatitis and display greater liver sensitivity to mechanical and toxic stress than wild type animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies from Ku et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] have shown that mutations on K8/18 predispose to the development of liver disease in humans. Moreover, modifications in IF organization and the formation of keratin containing aggregates, named Mallory bodies (MBs), are observed in different liver diseases such as alcoholic hepatitis, Wilson's disease, Indian childhood cirrhosis and liver steatosis in obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Other proteins, such as ubiquitin and the heat shock protein 70 kDa (HSP70), are also present in MBs and could play a role in their formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that keratins are necessary to preserve the hepatocytes integrity upon stressful conditions. It is still unclear how keratins accomplish these protective roles. Previous studies have shown that modifications in keratin phosphorylation are associated with various conditions such as mitosis, apoptosis and stress, suggesting a role for this post-translational modification in the modulation of keratin-related functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Long-term treatment of mice with a diet containing griseofulvin (GF) induces the development of an hepatitis associated with the formation of MBs, which are biochemically and morphologically similar to those found in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. This animal model constitutes a useful tool to investigate the keratin dynamics in the response of hepatocytes to the presence of a hepatotoxic agent.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the effect of chronic GF intoxication on hepatocytes from C3H and FVB/n mouse strains. We monitored the expression of the stress inducible form of the heat shock protein 70 kDa (HSP70i) and the induction of K8/18 phosphorylation at specific sites: K8 on serine 79 (K8 S79), K8 on serine 436 (K8 S436), K18 on serine 52 (K18 S52) and K18 on serine 33 (K18 S33) (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]). We also examined the possible relationship between HSP70i expression and K8/18 phosphorylation, during the development of hepatitis and in MB formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Induction of HSP70i and K8/18 phosphorylation upon GF-treatment in C3H and FVB/n mouse livers</title><p>The modifications in the amount of HSP70i, K8/18, and phosphorylated keratins (K8 pS79, K8 pS436 and K18 pS33) were analyzed by Western Blotting of total proteins from control and GF-treated C3H and FVB/n mouse livers (2 weeks, 6 weeks and 5 months). GF intoxication induced an increase in keratin levels in livers from both mouse strains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A,1B</xref>).

Significant changes in K8 and K18 phosphorylation occurred after GF-treatment in both mouse strains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C,1D,1E,1F,1G</xref>).

Although most of these reports lead towards roles for K8/18 in the resistance of cells to mechanical and toxic stress, the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenomena remain to be elucidated. To date, most of our understanding of the pathways involving keratins in the response of hepatocytes to toxic stress comes from the analyses of various cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. K8/18 phosphorylation at specific sites has been proposed to be a key factor in the regulation of those keratin functions. In this regard, K8 pS79, K8 pS436, K18 pS52 and K18 pS33 are the most studied phosphorylation sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p><italic>In vivo</italic>, K8/18 are also subjected to phosphorylation and, as suggested by <italic>in vitro </italic>studies, it is proposed to help hepatocytes to cope with toxic stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. For instance, transgenic mice expressing human K18 S52 mutated in alanine mutant are more susceptible to drug-induced liver injury than transgenic mice over expressing wild type human K18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we showed that the chronic intoxication of mice with GF, which is known to induce modifications in keratin organization and formation of MBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], was associated with increased expression of the stress protein HSP70i. GF-treatment resulted in a rapid increase in the expression of HSP70i. This modification was already perceptible after 2 weeks of treatment and was maintained for the whole period of treatment. This result provides direct evidence that GF-treatment, which has been proposed to constitute an oxidative stress for hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], triggers signaling pathways involved in cellular protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. This interpretation of our biochemical data is in agreement with our immunofluorescence study, which showed that HSP70i partly relocalized to the nucleus during the treatment. This distribution pattern is typical of the distribution of HSP70i in stressed cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>We have previously shown that GF intoxication induced an overall increase in K8/18 phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Here, we show that GF-treatment is associated with modifications in K8/K18 phosphorylation at specific sites such as: K8 S79, K8 S436 and K18 S33. Among the studied phosphorylation sites, and because it was present and was increased in all treated hepatocytes, K18 pS33 was the keratin phosphoepitope the tissue distribution of which resembled that of HSP70i. The phosphorylation of K18 S33 has been shown to play a role in keratin reorganization during mitosis and by linking 14-3-3 proteins, to modulate their function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Hence, we propose that K18 S33 phosphorylation could be linked to IF reorganization during GF intoxication. Moreover, because K18 pS33 is increased in all hepatocytes, it could be implicated in the stress response by participating in the relocalization and/or the recruitment of molecules or factors implicated in stress-induced cell signaling.</p><p>In contrast to K18 pS33, phosphorylated K8 species, K8 pS79 and K8 pS436 were not present in control mice hepatocytes. After 2 and 6 weeks of treatment, we observed an increase in the level of phosphorylation on these sites. However, contrary to HSP70i and K18 pS33, these phosphorylation sites were only present in isolated cells (singlet or doublets) or clusters of cells. Labeled singlet or doublet cells were more numerous after staining with the anti-K8 pS79 than after staining with the anti-K8 pS436. These cells could correspond to cells that are undergoing mitosis. This is supported by previous studies which showed that the phosphorylation of K8 on S79 and S436 occurs during mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. This interpretation is also in agreement with the work of Stumptner et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], which showed the presence of cell doublets reactive with the anti-K8 pS79 after a short treatment with DDC that induces on the long term MB formation. The discrepancy in the number of cells stained for K8 pS79 and K8 pS436, both in the singlet and doublet cells, suggests that different kinases are involved in the phosphorylation of those sites.</p><p>The presence of K8 pS79 and K8 pS436 was also detected in islets of cells. Interestingly, both antigens were present in the same clusters of cells surrounding unstained cells that were most likely undergoing apoptosis. These unstained cells are evocative of detached cells during anoikis, an apoptotic process that can be induced by loss of cell-cell anchorage. Stress and apoptosis has been shown to modulate K8 S79 and K8 S436 phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The observed phosphorylation could indicate that these hepatocytes are stressed hepatocytes intended to apoptosis. However, analysis of the livers for the presence of apoptosis showed that only a few hepatocytes are going through programmed cell death and groups of cells in apoptosis were never observed (data not shown). We propose that the apoptotic cell could represent the starting point of a signal transduction pathway to neighboring cells. The activation of specific kinases that would phosphorylate keratins could provide those cells a resistance to apoptosis. This latter interpretation is in agreement with the notion that K8/18 intermediate filaments play a key role in the protection of cells against apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Liao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] have shown that HSP70 associates with K8/18 <italic>via </italic>K8. Our study show that colocalization of HSP70i and IFs occurs only in a few hepatocytes. Since the hepatocytes, in which colocalization was observed, contained K8 pS79 or K8 pS436, HSP70i binding to IFs in these cells may be related to the presence of keratin phosphorylation and participates to cellular pathways involving phosphorylated K8/18 on specific sites. Ku et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] have shown that phosphorylation could modulate K8/18 ubiquitination and ensuing turnover. Knowing that binding of HSP70 to a protein can affect its targeting by kinases or phosphatases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>], HSP70i could bind to phosphorylated K8 species, prevent dephosphorylation by specific phosphatases, and thereby enhance phosphorylation-mediated K8/18 protection from degradation by the ubiquitin pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. However, since HSP70i and phosphorylated K8 species colocalized only in a few cells over the whole tissue, the relevance of this phenomenon in the response to the presence of the hepatotoxin needs to be addressed and further investigations will be necessary to confirm that hypothesis.</p><p>Chronic intoxication of mice with GF induces the formation of MBs. Numerous studies have demonstrated the presence of different phosphorylated K8/18 species within MBs, suggesting that K8/18 phosphorylation could participate in the MB formation processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. In our experiments, we showed that K8 pS436 and K18 pS33 were present in all observed MBs, whereas K8 pS79 was present in MBs in C3H mice hepatocytes but not in FVB/n mice. The difference in the presence of K8 pS79 phosphoepitope within MBs suggests that phosphorylation at that specific site is not essential for MB formation. However, as suggested by Stumptner et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], because K8 pS436 and K18 pS33 are always detected in MBs, phosphorylation on these sites could be implicated in the processes of MB formation. Taken together, those results indicate that in the context of MB formation, K8/18 phosphorylation should not be considered as a general phenomenon but as specific events that affect precise sites on K8 or K18. The difference observed between keratin phosphorylation in C3H and FVB/n mice indicates that the genetic background influences the response of hepatocytes to toxic stress. This interpretation is in agreement with the results obtained with K8-null mice which displayed variable phenotypes depending on the genetic background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>The treatment with GF that represents a toxic stress, most likely, involves the activation of stress activated protein kinases (SAPKs) in some hepatocytes. SAPKs p38 and JNK are physiologic kinases for K8 S79 and K8 S436 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. We postulate that p38 kinase and/or JNK are activated by GF-treatment in some hepatocytes and are responsible for the modifications in K8 phosphorylation we observed. K8 and K18 give different patterns of phosphorylated cells indicating that, under the same conditions, K8 and K18 phosphorylation is regulated differently.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results show that increases in HSP70i, K8/18 expression and K8/18 phosphorylation constitute early events in the response of hepatocytes to the presence of GF. These observations support a role for keratins in preserving cellular integrity during stress conditions induced by the presence of a chemical agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. HSP70i expression in hepatocytes after GF-treatment is not directly related to K8/18 phosphorylation at the studied sites: K8 S79, K8 S436 and K18 S33. With regard to MB formation, it appears that both HSP70i and K8/18 phosphorylation might contribute to the IF aggregation processes. The involvement of K8/18 phosphorylation in MB formation seems to be related only to specific sites and dependent on mouse genetic inheritance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Experimental design</title><p>Experiments were performed with adult C3H mice (Charles River Canada, St-Constant, QC) and FVB/n mice (Baribault et al. 1994) weighing 25 to 30 g.
