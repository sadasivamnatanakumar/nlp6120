The Ghana Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS), as a strategy to achieve the goal of PHC, has shown significant successes in communities where it has been implemented. However, a number of challenges continue to affect the effective functioning of CHPS. This study explored the community level and health system constraints on the effective functioning of CHPS in the delivering of PHC services in the Jirapa Municipality. A qualitative approach was implemented. A criterion-based purposive sampling technique was employed to recruit 51 managers and health service providers of CHPS for key informant interviews. The respondents included 25 community health management committee members, 25 health officers in charge of CHPS facilities, and one municipal CHPS coordinator. The interviews were held from September 18 to November 23, 2020. All interviews were face-to-face, audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis based on the constant comparative method was employed to analyse the data. The results showed that low community involvement in CHPS activities, disputes over the location and naming of CHPS zones, inadequate understanding of the CHPS concept and religious beliefs were the key community level factors which negatively affected the functioning of CHPS. Also, lack of logistics, financial constraints, poor attitude of health workers and inadequate staff motivation were the health sector constraints on the effective functioning of CHPS. In conclusion, concerted efforts are needed to tackle the community level and health system constraints to improve the overall functioning and effectiveness of the CHPS strategy. We recommend the strengthening of community sensitization, timely disbursement of funding, and provision of infrastructure and supplies to improve upon the effective functioning of CHPS as a strategy for delivery PHC in Ghana.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="0"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="15"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>The study used qualitative data that was tape-recorded and transcribed.

A substantial chunk of recent health policy discussions is centred on achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, a milestone that prioritizes universal health coverage (UHC) [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The 9th Global Conference on Health Promotion reaffirmed the role of PHC in achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. PHC is <italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;essential health care based on practical</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">scientifically sound and socially acceptable methods and technology made universally accessible to individuals and families in the community through their full participation and at a cost that the community and the country can afford</italic>&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. PHC supports the goal of &#x02018;health for all&#x02019; by acting as the first point of contact for patients and by providing care that is both family and community oriented, taking into account the critical influences of social networks, and providing services that are well-coordinated and ensure continuity of care [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Rural-urban disparities in the availability and accessibility of health care, particularly in poor and middle income nations, have resulted in widespread differentials in morbidity and mortality rates across the world [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Rural residents in most of these nations are constrained in their utilization of health services than their urban counterparts due to a variety of socioeconomic and health system constraints [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Given the inequalities that occur within countries, reaching UHC would necessitate all-inclusiveness and participatory interactions between health systems and the people [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As a result, the performance of community health systems has become increasingly important in both high-income and low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The declaration of the Alma-Alta on PHC in 1978 enjoined nations to make health care accessible, affordable, and situated within the cultural context of the people [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Inspired by the Alma Ata commitment to PHC, and regarded as a bold departure from bureaucratic models of health service delivery, the Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) is a Ghanaian national health policy initiative that was piloted in 1999 [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Under the CHPS programme, community health providers, assisted by community volunteers, are required to deliver healthcare closer to community members&#x02019; homes, especially in rural and slum communities [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Maternal and reproductive health care, child health services, health education, healthy lifestyle promotion, minor ailment case management, community mobilization for health action, referrals, home visits, and client follow-ups are all included in the key service package of CHPS [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. As a strategy to increase rural access to health care services while empowering local communities to take greater control over their health, the CHPS initiative sought to promote community-driven health care services, with technical support from the Ghana Health Service [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. CHPS, therefore, aimed to bring health services to community locations, develop sustainable volunteerism and community health action. This invariably empowers women and vulnerable groups, and helps to improve interaction among health providers, members of the households and the community at large [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This initiative aims to remove physical and geographical barriers to health care delivery in Ghana&#x02019;s poorest regions and communities [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Its ultimate goal is to transform the dynamics of rural health care service delivery from community health care providers who passively wait for patients into outreach workers who actively seek patients in communities and their homes, also known as doorstep services [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. CHPS implementation at the local level necessitates collaboration between the health sector and communities, as it entails systematic planning and bargaining with all stakeholders, including the local government, political establishment, and community representatives, through community mobilization and effective involvement [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The CHPS programme with its health volunteers, vibrant community involvement, resident nurses, and routine household outreach services in which nurses visited every home a minimum of four times per year, lowered mortality by almost 30% even in communities with relatively low health seeking behaviours [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Even though the CHPS strategy showed significant impact in the pilot communities, its replication and scaling up came with a lot of challenges and its impact on health and demographic outcomes has since stagnated [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. According to the National CHPS Policy, a well-functioning CHPS zone that stands the test of time shall have the following characteristics; a well-functioning supervision system, a well-organized team of health workforce (Community Health Officer [CHO] and Community Health Volunteers [CHVs]), continuous quality health services, a good health financing system, a good leadership and governance system, and a team approach to service delivery [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A well-functioning CHPS provides a platform for the provision of integrated PHC to communities. The provision of these services is carried out jointly by the CHO and CHV and supported by the Community Health Management Committee (CHMC) [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The CHMC include individuals from communities within the CHPS zone, representing various constituents (youth, women, the aged, etc.) within the catchment area of the CHPS zone. The CHPS service package includes community linkage and outreach services; basic clinical services; and management of activities, logistics, and services.</p><p>In spite of its promising start and positive prospects, the performance of the CHPS initiative has since been experiencing continuous deterioration in some aspects of health service delivery; particularly in the aspect of home visits, immunization coverage, antenatal care, child welfare clinics and community participation [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This situation is not different in the Jirapa Municipality, where even though there are CHPS facilities dotted everywhere, improving access to quality health care is still considered a major challenge in most communities [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In the Jirapa Municipality for instance, childhood vaccination by CHPS for Penta 3, has witnessed a decline from a coverage of 62.3% in 2020 to 62% in 2021 and to 55% in 2022 [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Most studies have so far focused on the contribution of CHPS facilities in health care delivery as a benchmark for further expansion of CHPS, community involvement and perceptions of the CHPS strategy for improving health outcomes in Ghana [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and the lessons learned from scaling up CHPS [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] with limited attention on the factors affecting the effective functioning of CHPS in Ghana. To bridge this gap in literature and generate evidence that is policy relevant to the current issues confronting CHPS, this study examined the community level and health system constraints on the effective functioning of CHPS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study setting and approach</title><p>The study was conducted in the Jirapa Municipality, located in the North Western part of the Upper West Region of Ghana. The Jirapa District was upgraded to a municipality status on 15th March, 2018 by L.I. 2278. The Municipality has a territorial size of 1,188.6 square kilometres representing 6.4 percent of the regional landmass. The projected total population of the Municipality is 106,670 comprising 52,454 males and 54,216 females distributed across 138 communities. The municipal economy is characterized by agricultural activities, services, agro-processing and other small scale manufacturing activities [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>The municipality has 57 health facilities comprising seven health centers, 47 CHPS zones, one polyclinic, one private clinic and a hospital. Out of these health facilities, three health centers and one hospital are managed by the Christian Health Association of Ghana (CHAG) [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. There are also 138 community-based surveillance volunteers (CBVs), 43 herbalist and traditional healers and 11 chemical sellers to facilitate healthcare delivery in the municipality [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The main health challenges of the municipality are, increasing incidence of lifestyle and diet-related diseases, huge gaps in geographical and financial access to quality health care and a limited coverage of social protection interventions [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>The study used a qualitative approach involving interviews with CHPS stakeholders. The qualitative approach allowed us to obtain rich views from participants in their natural setting. The approach enabled an in-depth exploration of the real-life experiences and perceptions of respondents regarding the effective functioning of CHPS in their communities.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Study population and sampling</title><p>The study population consists of key stakeholders of the CHPS programme within the Jirapa Municipality. The key stakeholders included 25 CHMC members, 25 health officers in charge of CHPS facilities, and one municipal CHPS coordinator. A criterion-based purposive sampling technique was used to select the key stakeholders of CHPS as key informants. CHMC chairpersons, CHPS facility in-charges, and the municipal CHPS coordinator were selected because of their expertise, experience, or position within the society, enabling them to provide rich information and a deeper insight into the issue at hand. The sample of 51 respondents was deemed adequate because the data collection reached a saturation point, hence data collection ended at the point where the responses given by participants started to become repetitive.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Data collection and analysis</title><p>Key informant interviews were used to collect data for this study. An interview guide was developed to capture information related to the factors affecting the effective functioning of CHPS in the area. The interview guide explored two broad themes namely, the community level factors affecting the effective functioning of CHPS, and the health system level factors that hampered the smooth operations of CHPS. A semi-structured instrument consisting of questions and probes to address the objectives of the study was used. Before the commencement of data collection, the interview guide was pre-tested at two CHPS zones in Babile a town which shares similar characteristics with the study area. The instrument was slightly revised for clarity, comprehensiveness and relevance, following the pre-test.</p><p>All interviews took place where it was most convenient for participants and lasted between 30&#x02013;50 minutes each. Interviews were conducted face-to-face at a serene location at the convenience of the participant. A team of three researchers collected the data. The team included the first author and two trained research assistants. The research assistants were graduate students pursuing courses in public health and possessed extensive qualitative research experiences and were familiar with the terrain and the culture of the people of the study area. All data collectors were fluent in the local (Dagaare) language. Some interviews were conducted in English and others in Dagaare. Participants were able to freely speak English or Dagaare, so they could express themselves comfortably. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and those in Dagaare were translated into English by the researchers. Field notes were documented, reconstructed and expanded following each interview, and the data from the field notes were incorporated into the analyses. Transcripts and notes were kept confidential in password-protected files.</p><p>The three authors participated in the data analysis. The transcripts were read independently by each team member to develop a coding structure reflecting issues arising from the data. Coding of the transcripts was done using NVivo, and commonly occurring themes and subthemes were identified. Thematic analysis relying on the constant comparison approach was adopted. Each author read and re-read each transcript and generated initial themes. The themes generated from the inductive coding of the first transcript served as the basis for constant comparison of the themes from the coding of the subsequent transcripts. The themes emerging from the coding of the transcripts by the three analysts were discussed jointly by all authors and common themes adopted. Where disagreements occurred, the three analysts reviewed their coding and further discussed the conflicting themes among themselves to reach an agreement. The results of the analysis are presented with supporting quotations from the data to elucidate respondents&#x02019; voices.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Institutional ethical approval was obtained from the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST) ethics review committee with ethical clearance number CHRPE/AP/453/20 before commencement of the study. An access approval was obtained from the Regional Health Directorate and the Jirapa Municipal Health Directorate as well as the Municipal Assembly before the study was carried out in the Municipality. Again, a written informed consent was obtained from opinion leaders in the study communities and the study participants to guarantee their voluntary participation in the study before the study instruments were administered. Also, all benefits and risks relating to the study were explained to all participants. Permission was duly sought before audio recordings of all sessions. The respondents were also assured of confidentiality of responses. Also, direct quotes from participants are identified by codes (CHPS in-charge, CI; CHMC chairpersons, CP; Municipal CHPS Coordinator, MC). Participation in the study was purely voluntary and no participant was coerced, maltreated or treated without respect. The study was implemented in line with the tenets of the declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec007"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Summary of themes and subthemes</title><p>As illustrated in <xref rid="pgph.0002094.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, two major factors were identified from the themes generated. These are community level factors and health system factors. On the side of the community level factors, disputes over the location and naming of CHPS zones, low community involvement, misunderstanding of the CHPS concept, and religious and traditional beliefs were the key constraints on the functioning of CHPS in the area. Also, health system constraints on the functioning of CHPS included logistical and financial constraints, poor staff attitudes and motivation.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pgph.0002094.t001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgph.0002094.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Summary of themes and subthemes.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pgph.0002094.t001" id="pgph.0002094.t001g" position="float"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Main theme</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sub theme</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Community level factors</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02022; <italic toggle="yes">Disputes over naming and location of CHPS facility</italic><break/>&#x02022; <italic toggle="yes">Low involvement in CHPS activities</italic><break/>&#x02022; <italic toggle="yes">Inadequate understanding of CHPS concept</italic><break/>&#x02022; <italic toggle="yes">Negative traditional and religious beliefs</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Health system factors</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02022; <italic toggle="yes">Logistical challenges</italic><break/>&#x02022; <italic toggle="yes">Financial constraints</italic><break/>&#x02022; <italic toggle="yes">Poor Staff attitudes</italic><break/>&#x02022; <italic toggle="yes">Poor staff motivation</italic></td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Community level factors</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Disputes over the location and naming of CHPS facilities</title><p>The study revealed that some communities disagreed with the location and naming of the CHPS facilities in their zones. The interviews revealed that some communities within certain CHPS zones wanted the CHPS facilities to be named after their communities and/ located in their communities. Such communities became unhappy when the CHPS facilities were named differently, usually in line with the name of the CHPS zone. These disagreements resulting from the naming and location of the CHPS facilities created disunity among the people within the CHPS zones which negatively affected the smooth operations of the CHPS facilities.</p><disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">In this zone, the communities have divergent views regarding the location of the CHPS, whiles others support the current location, some are vehemently opposed to where it is cited. This disagreement has also been extended to the choice of name for the CHPS. The other community wanted their community&#x02019;s name to be used for naming the CHPS but this was ignored and has actually created division among the communities. For example, at Tigbe CHPS, the Tia people wanted their name to come first, and the Gbee people too wanted their name to come first (CHPS In-charges)</italic>.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Actually, in some communities they want the CHPS to have their community&#x02019;s name on the sign post. But the understanding is that, the CHPS name should bear the zone name, and so there have been issues when it comes to naming the CHPS. So sometimes the only thing to do to mitigate the situation is to take away the sign post but the assigned name remained unchanged in our documents (CHPS Coordinator)</italic>.</p></disp-quote></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Low community involvement</title><p>The interviews also revealed that community involvement in CHPS activities was low. This was attributed to the inability of the management of the CHPS facilities to provide refreshment for community members for participating in CHPS activities. The interviews revealed that some community members frequently demanded that the CHOs should buy them pito (a local alcoholic drink) for refreshment before they could participate in CHPS activities.</p><disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">Community involvement in this CHPS has become low, and the reason is that anytime they come for meeting they usually complain of our inability to provide them &#x02018;water&#x02019; (pito).

The key officers of the CHPS initiative including the municipal CHPS coordinator argued that before the establishment of a CHPS facility in an area, the residents of that area are often educated on the CHPS concept including its focus on health promotion and disease prevention. However, the interviews revealed that some community members still often misconstrued the CHPS facility as a health centre, and often demanded curative services and refused to honour referrals from the CHOs to higher level facilities for clinical services that could not be provided by the CHPS facilities. This situation depicts a failure of the authorities to properly drive home the purpose of CHPS to the understanding of the people at the grassroots.</p><disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">I think the people have mistaken the CHPS to be a health centre or hospital due to their lack of understanding of the CHPS concept.

It was observed that because of some religious beliefs, certain community members, refused to permit their spouses to utilize certain CHPS services. For instance, because of some reservations about family planning on the basis of religion, some women were apprehensive when it came to utilizing such services of CHPS.</p><disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">About half (50%) of the community members are Muslims.

The interviews revealed that as a local adaption to the logistic challenge, health workers often use their personal motorbikes to carry out CHPS activities while the Municipal Health Directorate commit to the servicing and fuelling of such motorbikes. The inability of the CHPS compounds to raise money on their own has made it difficult for such facilities to acquire and maintain the needed tools and logistics required for their effective functioning.</p><disp-quote><p><italic toggle="yes">Hmmm</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">it is a challenge because all our motorbikes are broken down</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">and we are using our private motorbikes for the services</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">The directorate only supports us with fuel and servicing of the motorbikes</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">and so it is a challenge</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">CHPS In-charges</italic>).</p><p><italic toggle="yes">Our major challenge is that we do not have enough motorbikes for the zones.

Among other attitudes, community members complained about absenteeism, verbal insults, fraudulent behaviour and general disrespect which amounted to unprofessional conduct and affected health care service delivery. A respondent blamed the poor health worker-community interactions on differences in cultural values and lifestyles between the non-indigene health workers and residents of the local communities.</p><disp-quote><p>
<italic toggle="yes">CHPS requires a lot of interaction between health workers and members of the community. Unfortunately, most of our health workers are not indigenes of our communities. Most of them tend to come from urban communities where the lifestyles and values appear very different from what they encounter in these rural parts. This often results in a clash of values. There was a report of a recent incident where the health worker considered the dressing of a community member as shabby and inappropriate and attempted to point that out, but this resulted in some verbal altercation, which nearly became physical (CHMC, Member)</italic>

Respondents complained bitterly about the lack of efforts to motivate staff to serve as incentives for better performance. They also indicated that where efforts are made to motivate them, the package tend to be too meagre and represent a mockery of their expectations.

After decades of operationalization and series of reviews, it is timely and apt to examine some of the factors challenging the effective functioning of CHPS especially in rural areas.</p><p>Low community involvement has been identified as one of the key factors which hamper the effective functioning of CHPS facilities. Community involvement in CHPS, contrary to policy expectations was rather low. This finding is in line with that of Gyang et al as well as Kweku et al who noted poor community participation as a major problem facing health service delivery within CHPS facilities [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In practice, CHPS system served as a national mechanism to deliver essential community based health services through the involvement of communities in the planning and delivery of PHC services [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, due to the low community involvement some of the important services provided under CHPS remain underutilized. Agalga et al have identified volunteer attrition, competing economic activities among others as factors contributing to low community participation in the CHPS programme [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Apathy among members of the community has also resulted in low coverage of certain activities such as immunization and other services provided by CHPS [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. As discovered by our study, the inability of the health officers to incentivize community members with a refreshment for participating in CHPS activities has exacerbated community members apathy towards CHPS activities.</p><p>The study also showed that inadequate understanding of the CHPS concept by community members has further contributed to low community involvement in CHPS activities. This situation may be as a result of lack of sensitization or communication challenges between the implementers and community members. This finding is in line with a study by Ghana Health Service [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] which showed that lack of communication and engagement of community members on the concept of CHPS have led to community members not understanding the distinction between community-based health services and services at a higher level health facility. Communities therefore expect any health facility to be able to deliver certain clinical care when required, and when those services are not delivered, their utilization of services is gravely affected. The fact that some CHOs were posted to CHPS compounds without adequate training on CHPS implementation seems to worsen this situation [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This has culminated in their inability to adequately educate and sensitize the community members to fully understand the operations of the CHPS. This finding has also been alluded to by previous authors [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], that community sensitization activities carried out by CHOs on the concept of CHPS had considerably influenced the utilization of health services by households. The ineffective nature of knowledge transfer between the system and the community as a result of poor sensitisation, fuelling misconceptions about the CHPS concept, has led to some community members refusing to honour referrals when the CHOs at the CHPS recommended them. If stakeholders, therefore, want to see the CHPS facilities function effectively then there is the need to enhance the sensitization of community members to understand and appreciate the concept of CHPS. Effective community level sensitisation can also reshape religious beliefs and traditional practices constraining the functioning of CHPS. This is capable of improving upon the uptake of services delivered by CHPS, especially that of family planning and child hood immunization services, which have been negatively impacted by existing negative religious beliefs and traditional practices.</p><p>Another issue impacting the effective functioning of CHPS is reported disagreements regarding the location and naming of CHPS zones. Similar to this, Kweku et al, have also asserted that sometimes the location of CHPS compounds was geographically inconvenient for some community members [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This defeats the principles of PHC where clients are supposed to have access to health care services at a timely and affordable manner especially during emergency situations. The greatest brunt of this is felt by pregnant women, since those who cannot access the CHPS facility for services like skilled delivery, may often resort to self-care, or patronage of services of improperly trained health providers, thereby increasing the number of home deliveries and the risk of maternal and infant mortalities [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This means that a timely and permanent resolution of all disputes regarding the location and naming of CHPS zones is required to ameliorate the situation. Health workers proffered that in situations where these disputes emerge, the best remedy to solving them was to site the CHPS facilities in neutral grounds and use generic names for the CHPS zones.</p><p>A fundamental health system factor affecting the functioning of CHPS facilities in the Municipality was logistical challenges. Essential items such as; ANC cards, fuel, motorbikes, transportation for referrals and essential drugs like anti-malaria drugs, basic antibiotics, syrups and paracetamol tablets as well as drugs for pregnant women were often reported not available at the CHPS facilities. Our findings agree with that of Nwameme et al who also noted shortage of medicines in CHPS facilities [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Equally, Adongo et al found that health service factors such as lack of adequate CHPS infrastructure and logistics have had an effect on the effective and efficient functioning of CHPS compounds [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Related to our findings, a recent study also found that, challenges of CHPS included non-availability of basic logistics, diagnostic accessories, refrigerators for storage of drugs and transport logistics (motorbikes and bicycles) [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The CHPS policy has prescribed the type of equipment needed in CHPS facilities for effective service delivery [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Unfortunately, many of these facilities visited did not have the full complement of the required equipment. The implications are that service delivery and coverage in these zones will tend to decline.</p><p>The inadequate logistics at the CHPS zones emanate from poor funding of CHPS [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Given that the CHPS initiative was implemented without any clearly defined regular funding source, it has been a challenge for the existing CHPS zones to mobilize enough funding to carry out their activities. The Ghana Health Service has also not enabled the CHPS to generate their own internally generated funds for the purpose of running the facilities. CHPS zones have to rely on their supervisory health centers for funding. A number of studies on the CHPS initiative have, therefore, consistently reported financial constraints as a major challenge to the effective functioning of CHPS [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Financial insufficiency of the CHPS facilities has also been attributed to delayed reimbursement of claims by the NHIS. This finding is in line with that of a study conducted by Assan et al [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] which linked funding challenges with CHPS to delayed reimbursement of claims by the NHIS. This delayed in claims reimbursements has been reported to have negative implications for the purchasing power of CHPS and hence the shortages of drugs and other logistics at the CHPS facilities. The delays in disbursement of NHIS funds is caused by multiple factors including but not limited to financial constraints on the part of NHIS, complicated claims processing procedure, fraud and misappropriation of funds [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Another key health system constraint reported by our study was poor attitudes of health workers. The study revealed that in some instances, health providers&#x02019; attitudes towards work were not encouraging and this had adverse effects on service delivery at the CHPS facilities. This finding appears to be in stark contrast with a study in Kentucky, United States of America, by Jaoko, that noted that the majority of health workers showed positive attitudes towards clients [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The findings of our study, however, concurs with a study which suggests that the image of health workers, especially nurses, in Ghana and some other Sub-Saharan African countries is not good [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. According to Wiru et al [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], the attitude of staff to clients could have a telling effect on utilization of health services at the PHC level. The negative attitudes and behaviours reported in this study were in line with claims by Dapaah that, in Ghana, people generally feel nurses are often unfriendly and rude [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This is in line with earlier findings where, patients reportedly experienced verbal abuses, rudeness and neglect [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Similar to the findings of O&#x02019;Donnell, this study also found that health facilities opened and closed irregularly due to staff absenteeism [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This is contrary to the Ghana Health Service guidelines which requires CHPS facilities to provide 24 hour services throughout the week [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The greatest victims of staff absenteeism are mostly pregnant women and children under five, as well as other vulnerable persons who may require emergency medical care at any time in the CHPS compound. The poor attitudes of staff towards clients can be attributed to cultural clashes between non-indigene health workers and rural residents on one hand and that of poor staff motivation on the other. The non-motivation of staff could be the reason why health workers in these rural settings often absent from work. Therefore, mechanisms to set aside funds to incentivize the health workforce financially can improve their interest in the work, their attitudes towards clients and enhance their performance in delivery services at the CHPS facilities. Buabeng [<xref rid="pgph.0002094.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] argue that performance does not depend only on knowledge and skills, but on motivation and job satisfaction. Good motivational packages will significantly transform the working environment of a health facility to undertake great strides to improve the effectiveness and quality of the services provided by the health worker.</p><sec id="sec020"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>The study only covered the perspectives of managers and health service providers under the CHPS initiative. The views and perspectives of other stakeholders, especially community level beneficiaries of the CHPS programme are, therefore, missing. Future studies should therefore include the community (service users) perspective on the factors influencing the functioning of CHPS as well.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Conclusion and recommendations</title><p>Community-based health service delivery is undoubtedly an essential component of the health sector of many developing countries. To realize the goals of PHC and the health SDGs, the optimal functioning of CHPS is vital. The most important community level factors that constrain the effectiveness of CHPS in delivery PHC services include low community involvement in CHPS activities, inadequate knowledge on the CHIPS concept, religious beliefs, and dispute on the location and naming of CHPS compounds. Associated with these are the health system constraints which include lack of logistics, poor attitude of health workers, inadequate funds as well as lack of staff motivation. We recommend a holistic approach to tackling these constraints to ensure that CHPS functions effectively and efficiently. First, at the community level, community sensitization and engagement should be deepened to encourage participation and support for CHPS activities. Thus, health managers and planners at the district level should continuously engage various stakeholders at the grassroots level regarding CHPS&#x02019; implementation and its milestones. This will enhance community buy in, build capacity of stakeholders and beneficiaries, improve knowledge, and whip up the necessary support for CHPS and its activities. The continuous engagement of various stakeholders will also reduce the apathy toward CHPS, encourage participation, reduce disputes, and improve the knowledge and understanding of the people on the goal and objectives of CHPS. Secondly, policy makers especially the Government should ensure that funding for CHPS is appropriately streamlined and disbursed timely. All sources of funding for CHPS including that of the NHIS should be harmonized and managed efficiently. Provision of logistics, infrastructure and supplies meant for CHPS should be prioritized. District health management teams together with the regional medical stores&#x02019; managers should formulate and enact actions that will ensure the regular stocking of CHPS zones with essential medicines to help meet the needs of community members and build trust in CHPS activities.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge the support of Mr Lius Mornaa of Lawra Municipal Health Directorate Mr Benedict Benloo Doozie and Mr. Emmanuel Ghansah-Quarshie of St. Joseph&#x02019;s Midwifery Training College during the data collection.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pgph.0002094.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><collab>World Health Organization</collab>. <source>Reforming health service delivery for universal health coverage</source>. <publisher-name>World Health Organization</publisher-name>; <year>2017</year>. <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-HIS-SDS-2017.9" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-HIS-SDS-2017.9</ext-link></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pgph.0002094.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Abiiro</surname><given-names>GA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>De Allegri</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>. <article-title>Universal health coverage from multiple perspectives: a synthesis of conceptual literature and global debates.</article-title>

Please provide further details about the Jirapa municipality, specifically about the utilization and status of scale up of CHPS - the rationale should justify why this enquiry now and why here?</p><p>2. What is the composition of CHMC? Do they include community stakeholders? How diverse is it? Is there representation of women and members of all ethnic sects? Further details needed</p><p>3. "This sampling method was used since qualitative researchers often depend on small sample sizes since</p><p>data saturation was the ultimate goal in this type of research, not the number of participants" - This</p><p>sampling method was used since qualitative researchers often depend on small sample sizes since</p><p>data saturation was the ultimate goal in this type of research, not the number of participants.</p><p>4. Conditions/criteria for sample selection has been mentioned partially - would you still call it purposive sampling or would you like to define the sampling method using a more refined terminology? Such as criterion sampling or even theoretical sampling? Refer Qualitative Inquiry and Research Design: Choosing Among Five Approaches</p><p>Book by Cheryl N. Poth and John W. Creswell for further information.</p><p>5. Who did the data collection?</p><p>Please give a brief description of the background and positionality of the researchers who did the data collection and/or the analysis. The constructivist paradigm mandates that the researchers reflexively engage with the research process and hence, a brief description of one's background, orientation and positionality is needed.</p><p>6. Please provide some more details about the analysis process. for instance,</p><p>1. Did you use constant comparison to move from open --&#x0003e; axial --&#x0003e; selective codes.</p><p>2. How many people were involved in the coding process?</p><p>3. Were the memos discussed within the teams?</p><p>4. How were the discordances sorted?</p><p>5. Since you committed to grounded theory approach, did you use theoretical sampling also? If yes, what were the initial theoretical categories?</p><p>6. You have also committed to a constructivist epistemology, indicating that you are closer to the modified approaches of grounded theory rather than the classical approach. In that case, the researchers' theoretical orientation in co-constructing the knowledge is of significance. Please elaborate on this. Refer the following paper for further information:</p><p>

</p><p>7. The reasons for low community involvement could have been probed further. This would have required a detailed probing of the community level stakeholders and also the system level stakeholders who are experienced richly in the context of Jirapa municipality.</p><p>8. Why did this "lack of understanding of CHPS occur in the community". This would have been an extremely useful enquiry. How did the community develop the "inadequate understanding"? Who transferred the information about CHPS to the community? Were they trained? What modalities did they used for information transfer? Was the process of information transfer adequate in content coverage and appropriate in terms of the mode of delivery? If such critical questions are not asked, the findings would come across as "victim blaming"</p><p>9. The failure of authorities to properly drive home the purpose of CHPS to the community could have been highlighted with evidence if the community's side of the story could also have been presented in a nuanced manner. Isn't that the ultimate purpose of qualitative research? To paint a holistic and balanced picture of any phenomenon?</p><p>10. The inadequate acknowledgement of religious beliefs and traditional practices in the design of CHPS is an important piece of contextual information which should have informed the implementation of CHPS in this community. Did the system not anticipate this aspect? If not why?</p><p>11. Why do these logistic challenges occur?</p><p>How does the system cope?</p><p>Have they tried any remedial measures?</p><p>Have these efforts, if any, produced any results, even if they are localized and of low intensity?</p><p>12. Negative staff attitudes is an important perception that can explain the low utilization by the community. However, in order to build a balanced construction, we need to know what do the system stakeholders think about this perception. How do they make sense of this perception. If they agree that this perception by the community is valid or justifiable, then why do they think this situation exists. A balanced epistemological construction requires us to take the knowledge generated from the one category of stakeholders (system) to another category (community) and vice versa for probing.</p><p>13. Why does delayed disbursement of NHS claims happen? Is it because of financial constraints at the NHIS or logistic/procedural reasons? The authors can attempt to build potential reasons for this, either from direct interviews with the NHIS level stakeholders or from policy documents or from existing literature.</p><p>14. What kind of motivation do the staff actually expect? The descriptions are too trimmed, sanitized and simplistic. Motivation of human resources is an intrinsically complex phenomenon and the authors seem to shy away from delving into the "mess"</p><p>15. Discussion is one of the better written sections of the paper.However, the section can be trimmed and structured better to bring out the "so what" of the findings. Also, it is important that the discussion section brings together all the key findings of the paper and build a coherent narrative/theory for the relatively low utilization of the programme.</p><p>I have presented a narrative below to consider:</p><p>1. Low community involvement has been identified as one of the key factors which hamper the utlization of the scheme.</p><p>2. The relatively low understanding of the scheme by the community and the gaps in the programme design characterized by its poor alignment with the social context, stratification, beliefs and value systems of the community could be the potential reasons for this.</p><p>3. The negative attitudes of the system level HR perceived by the community indicates the ineffective nature of knowledge transfer between the system and the community, which could in turn be driven by the financial constraints faced by the system and the poor motivation of the HR.</p><p>What are the potential reasons for poor community involvement/participation of any community based health programme? What does international literature say about this? Connect this to each step of the aforementioned narrative.</p><p>16. In the discussion section, it is critical to connect the negative staff attitudes to their poor motivation and acknowledge the systemic causes for this. Otherwise it looks like we are unjustly labelling the health workers working in a public sector which is marred by financial constraints. The construction should be made more balanced to avoid "blaming"</p><p>17. Findings cannot be generalized is NOT a limitation of qualitative research. Qualitative research is built on constructive/transformational paradigms which are based on the ontological and epistemological assumptions that reality is multiple and is socially constructed. Here, our objective is to build balanced and holistic constructions of "how" and "why" social phenomena occur. Please revisit the statement.</p><p>18. Overall copyediting and English correction is recommended</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;1) The manuscript requires copyediting. Sentence formation need to be changed in certain places which are marked with comments in the uploaded reviewer document.</p><p>2) In methodology portion few things need to be elaborately described particular places are marked in the file.</p><p>3) Stating generalizability as a limitation is not acceptable as qualitative study is not meant for generalizability.</p><p>4) All the comments in the file may be addressed for the fine tuning of the manuscript.</p><p>**********</p><p><!-- <font color="black"> -->6.
