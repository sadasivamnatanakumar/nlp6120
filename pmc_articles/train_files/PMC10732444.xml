Identifying children at risk of poor development is important in targeting early interventions to children and families most in need of support. We aimed to develop a predictive model that could inform early support for vulnerable children.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>We analysed linked administrative records for a birth cohort of 2,380 Northern Territory children (including 1,222 Aboriginal children) who were in their first year of school in 2015 and had a completed record from the Australian Early Development Census (AEDC). The AEDC measures early child development (school readiness) across five domains of development. We fitted prediction models, for AEDC weighted summary scores, using a Partial Least Square Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM) considering four groups of factors&#x02013;pre-pregnancy, pregnancy, known at birth, and child-related factors. We first assessed the models&#x02019; internal validity and then the out-of-sample predictive power (external validity) using the PLS<sub>predict</sub> procedure.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Result</title><p>We identified separate predictive models, with a good fit, for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children. For Aboriginal children, a significant pre-pregnancy predictor of better outcomes was higher socioeconomic status (direct, &#x003b2; = 0.22 and indirect, &#x003b2; = 0.16). Pregnancy factors (gestational diabetes and maternal smoking (indirect, &#x003b2; = -0.09) and child-related factors (English as a second language and not attending preschool (direct, &#x003b2; = -0.28) predicted poorer outcomes. Further, pregnancy and child-related factors partially mediated the effects of pre-pregnancy factors; and child-related factors fully mediated the effects of pregnancy factors on AEDC weighted scores. For non-Aboriginal children, pre-pregnancy factors (increasing maternal age, socioeconomic status, parity, and occupation of the primary carer) directly predicted better outcomes (&#x003b2; = 0.29). A technical observation was that variance in AEDC weighted scores was not equally captured across all five AEDC domains; for Aboriginal children results were based on only three domains (emotional maturity; social competence, and language and cognitive skills (school-based)) and for non-Aboriginal children, on a single domain (language and cognitive skills (school-based)).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The models give insight into the interplay of multiple factors at different stages of a child&#x02019;s development and inform service and policy responses. Recruiting children and their families for early support programs should consider both the direct effects of the predictors and their interactions. The content and application of the AEDC measurement need to be strengthened to ensure all domains of a child&#x02019;s development are captured equally.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

It is also the period in which inequalities experienced by disadvantaged populations are established and potentially persist into adolescence and adulthood. As such, early childhood is widely recognised as one of the best opportunities to overcome inequalities through investment in early interventions that provide additional support to disadvantaged children and families.</p><p>The etiology of delay in children&#x02019;s early developmental outcome is multifactorial [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and includes genetic and environmental factors, and their interaction [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].

This census was initially known as the Australian Early Development Index (AEDI) and from 2014 has been known as the Australian Early Development Census (AEDC) [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The AEDC measures early childhood development at school entry (usually age 5) across five distinct domains: physical health and wellbeing, social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills (school-based), and communication skills and general knowledge [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people (hereafter respectfully referred to as Aboriginal people) experience significant educational, health and social inequalities because of a history of colonisation and adverse social policies across generations. Starting from the prenatal period, Aboriginal children are much more likely to face multiple social and health disadvantages than other Australian children. This inequality continues in the first year of full-time schooling, at around age 5. Although the proportion of Aboriginal children identified as developmentally vulnerable has decreased from 47.4% in 2009 to 41.3% in 2018 (defined as developmentally vulnerable on one or more AEDC domains), this proportion remains almost twice that of non-Aboriginal children (20.4% in 2018) [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The disparity experienced by Aboriginal children persists after controlling for non-English speaking background, jurisdiction and socioeconomic condition of the child&#x02019;s community of residence, demonstrated by Brinkman et al after analysing the 2009 AEDC data from Australian states and territories [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Analysis of AEDC data has also highlighted one potential area to improve educational outcomes and reduce educational inequality&#x02014;preschool participation [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Nonetheless by 2021, more than ten years after the Australian governments&#x02019; &#x02018;Closing the Gap&#x02019; agreement to overcome. Indigenous disadvantage only 41% of Aboriginal children attended 15 hours of preschool a week [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. A new National Agreement on Closing the Gap was approved in 2020 and included two targets relating to early childhood development&#x02014;(a) to increase the proportion of Aboriginal children enrolled in early childhood education to 95% by 2025; and, (b) to increase the proportion of Aboriginal children assessed as developmentally on track in all five AEDC domains to 55% by 2031 [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>The Northern Territory (NT) is a large, remote and sparsely populated area of northern and central Australia. The NT has distinct demography compared to other states and territories in Australia, with: the smallest total population (approximately 247,300) [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]; a much greater proportion of Aboriginal children (39.7% compared with 4.8% for Australia as a whole); enrolling in remote or very remote schools (47.8% c/w 3.0%); and, with language background other than English at school entry (39.4% c/w 18.0%) [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The gap between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children in early developmental outcomes is greater in the Northern Territory (NT) than in other states and territories of Australia. The first study of NT children&#x02019;s early developmental outcomes, based on AEDC, found a higher proportion of Aboriginal children identified as developmentally vulnerable on one or more AEDC domain(s) than non-Aboriginal children (68.3% c/w 23.2%), with half of this difference explained by potentially modifiable early health and sociodemographic factors [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. A more recent study found that once these modifiable factors were adjusted, in multivariable analysis, Indigenous status was no longer associated with developmental vulnerability and that the main influences associated with children&#x02019;s developmental outcome were early life health and sociodemographic factors [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The findings from these previous studies suggest potential levers to &#x02018;close the gap&#x02019; in educational outcomes in Australia [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], with the need to recognise NT&#x02019;s distinct characteristics.</p><p>In the NT there is a substantial overlap between Aboriginal children and children with a non-English speaking background. Brinkman et al found that less than 1% of all Australian children (excluding the NT) taking AEDC assessment have both Aboriginal heritage and non-English speaking background [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. It is not clear how the higher proportion of students with non-English speaking background affects the interpretation of the AEDC results, given that two of the five AEDC domains are related to language (language and cognitive skills (school based), and communication skills and general knowledge) [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Brinkman et al had earlier noted that students are often required to demonstrate competencies in English <italic toggle="yes">&#x0201c;data for some children with language backgrounds other than English will continue to reflect developing English proficiency</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">rather than developmental deficiency of lack of capacity&#x0201d;</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].

We conducted correlation, chi-square, and t-tests to check for crude relationships between the outcome and predictor variables. As the outcome to be predicted is a latent variable, fitting prediction models went through two steps. In the first step we identified potential predictor variables using regression analysis. In this step the total AEDC summary scale scores (the sum of the scale scores for all five domains) were used as a continuous outcome variable. We checked the distribution of the summary scale scores in Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children. We found the distribution of scale scores to be approximately normal in Aboriginal children but significantly skewed in their non-Aboriginal peers. Further, to account for unobserved clustering effects for children from the same teacher (who administered the AEDC assessment) and school (where the teachers work), we fitted a multilevel model (Appendix I in <xref rid="pone.0296051.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>). For Aboriginal children, we fitted a mixed linear model using total AEDC summary scale scores. For non-Aboriginal children we fitted a multilevel logistic regression with robust standard error [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>] using results for each of the five domains as well as the summary measure &#x02018;being developmentally vulnerable in two or more domains&#x02019; (DV2) [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. We fitted separate prediction models for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children for the following reasons: (i) there were differences in the number and type of predictors we identified in the regression analysis (Appendix II in <xref rid="pone.0296051.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>); (ii) there were differences in the distributions of the AEDC measurement; and (iii) the AEDC domains were not equally captured by Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].</p><p>In the second step we fitted a predictive model using the identified predictors (with p&#x0003c; = 0.1) from regression analysis following the life course framework (<xref rid="pone.0296051.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). As AEDC scores are a latent construct representing child development (school readiness) and the intention of this analysis was prediction, we fitted the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM) [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. This model has been recommended for use in developmental studies [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The PLS-SEM is a composite-based model in which the latent variables are measured as a weighted composites of their indicators to maximize their explained variance [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The composite scores were computed as a weighted sum of the set of indicators, and the variance of the component was equivalent to one. In the final component score estimates, the path coefficients and loadings were estimated by ordinary least squares and the standard errors were estimated via the bootstrap method [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>].</p><p>The five domains of AEDC were measured formatively and we fitted a formative measurement model. The assumption behind formative measurement is that the AEDC is formed by an equal non-replaceable representation of the five domains.

We assessed the measurement model for collinearity of the indicators (variance inflation factor (VIF) &#x0003e; 5 is not acceptable), and significance and relevance of indicators outer weights (recommended to be greater than 0.5 and significant) [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. After having checked for satisfactory fit of the measurement model, we assessed the in-sample (in the study sample population) fit of the structural model using a coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>), significance and relevance of structural path coefficients, Standardized Mean Square Residual (SMSA &#x0003c; 0.08), and Normal Fit Index (NFI&#x0003e; 0.9). We then assessed the model&#x02019;s in-sample predictive relevance or predictive accuracy (Q<sup>2</sup>) by running a blindfolding-based cross-validated redundancy with omission distance of seven (should be above zero) [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>].</p><p>We finally assessed the out-of-sample (in the extrapolated sample population) predictive power of the model using the PLS<sub>predict</sub> procedure.

The PLS<sub>predict</sub> uses a concept of k-fold cross-validation.

We set the PLS<sub>predict</sub> algorithm to do a 10-fold cross validation with 10 times repetition [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. The out-of-sample predictive relevance of the predictive model (Q<sup>2</sup><sub>predict</sub>), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) were used to evaluate model out-of-sample predictive power. These prediction statistics and the model selection indices (AIC &#x00026; BIC) were used for comparing the in-sample and out-of-sample predictive ability of different competing predictive models [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. We used prediction errors distribution obtained from the PLS-SEM and linear model to choose between the two preferred prediction statistics (MAE or RMSE). We used a guideline developed by Shmueli et al to judge the out-of-sample prediction power of the models [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Lastly, we selected and interpreted a non-recursive (simple) model with better predictive power.

Aboriginal children were more likely to have missing observations than non-Aboriginal children in all six variables (<xref rid="pone.0296051.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The missing mechanisms is potentially missing not at random (MNAR) as the reason for missingness was explained by other missing covariates and the missing values themselves might be more likely to correlate with the missing values (for example a woman with low level of education is more likely to escape the question because of social desirability issues). We also checked that the missingness was not dependent on the outcome (AEDC) after adjusting for the other covariates. We checked this by first creating a missing indicator variable for each variable with missingness (yes = 1, no) and then fitting regression to model the missingness accounting for other covariates. In this case, methodological studies have reported that multiple imputation (MI) tends to be biased away from the null and complete case analysis (CCA) is a better approach [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>].

As a sensitivity analysis, we fitted two models that applied the two methods of handling missing and compared the results: (i) missing indicator, considering missingness as a separate category, and (ii) MI by chained equations (MICE) and found them to retain different covariates in the final models to those identified with CCA (Appendix II in <xref rid="pone.0296051.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0296051.t001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0296051.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Pre-pregnancy and pregnancy characteristics and their univariate association with AEDC scale score (N = 2380).</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0296051.t001" id="pone.0296051.t001g" position="float"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="justify" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Variables</th><th align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Aboriginal children</th><th align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

The study participant characteristics and their univariate association are displayed in <xref rid="pone.0296051.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Slightly more than half (51.3%) of the children in this study were non-Aboriginal children. Most non-Aboriginal children (73.5%) were from an outer regional area (Darwin and surrounds). About 31.0% of mothers of non-Aboriginal children had a Bachelor&#x02019;s degree or higher qualification while more than half of the mothers of Aboriginal children (62.7%) had no formal school qualification. Maternal education and occupation had significant association with AEDC in both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children. A higher proportion of mothers of Aboriginal children had a record of smoking (37.5% Vs 10.5%) and alcohol consumption (11.5% Vs 3.0%) during pregnancy compared to mothers of non-Aboriginal children. There was evidence that both smoking during pregnancy and any record of an obstetric complication were associated with lower AEDC scores for both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Birth and child-related characteristics of the study participants</title><p>Birth and child-related study participants characteristics and univariate association are presented in <xref rid="pone.0296051.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Gender of the newborn and birth length are the two covariates known at birth for which there was evidence of an association with AEDC outcomes for both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children. More than two-thirds of Aboriginal (70.6%) and three-quarters of non-Aboriginal (88.9%) children attended preschool, with preschool attendance associated with the outcome for Aboriginal children only. English as a second language, number of notifications in the first three years, and gastroenteritis are the three child-related factors for which there is evidence of an association with the outcome for both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children. The mean (&#x000b1;SD) and median (IQR) of AEDC are substantially different for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0296051.t002"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0296051.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Birth and child-related characteristics of study participants and their univariate association with AEDC scale score (N = 2380).</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0296051.t002" id="pone.0296051.t002g" position="float"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="justify" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Variables</th><th align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Aboriginal children</th><th align="justify" rowspan="2" colspan="1">

The in-sample (with Q<sup>2</sup> = 0.111) and out-of-sample (with Q<sup>2</sup><sub>predict</sub> = 0.137) prediction power of the model for Aboriginal children was higher than the acceptable threshold (&#x0003e; 0). Furthermore, most of the prediction errors of the PLS-SEM are lower than the naive linear regression (LM) model (<xref rid="pone.0296051.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) demonstrating the model&#x02019;s moderate to high out-of-sample predictive power. The direct and indirect effects of constructs having a relevance prediction are presented in <xref rid="pone.0296051.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The pre-pregnancy construct (IRSD) had a direct (&#x003b2; = 0.22), indirect (&#x003b2; = 0.16) and total (&#x003b2; = 0.38) positive prediction effect on the AEDC outcome. The pregnancy factors construct (smoking and gestational diabetes) had an indirect (&#x003b2; = -0.03) and a total (&#x003b2; = -0.09) minor negative prediction effects on the AEDC outcome. The construct for child-related factors (English as a second language and not attending preschool) (&#x003b2; = -0.28) directly predicted a lower AEDC score. Further, pregnancy and child-related factors had a minor partial mediation effect on the link between IRSD and the AEDC outcome, and child-related factors fully mediated the path from pregnancy to the AEDC outcome. Overall, the model can make out-of-sample prediction with a high probability and relatively narrow prediction interval. For example, if the correct AEDC score of a child is 23, the 95% prediction interval would fall between 23&#x000b1;2*MAE of the AEDC construct (0.766), which is (21.468, 24.532) and arguably acceptable as the range of AEDC score runs from zero to 50.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="pone.0296051.t003"><object-id

Furthermore, prediction errors (MAE) of all the domains of AEDC found from PLS-SEM model are less than the prediction errors found from the naive linear regression (LM) that demonstrated the model&#x02019;s high power for predicting the AEDC score of a child in the population (<xref rid="pone.0296051.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Pre-pregnancy risk factors (older maternal age and IRSD, better occupation, and low parity) had a direct (&#x003b2; = 0.246) positive prediction effect on the AEDC score. In addition, there were non-significant indirect paths that increased the total prediction effect of pre-pregnancy risk factors to &#x003b2; = 0.287. Overall, the model can make out-of-sample prediction of AEDC scores for non-Aboriginal children with a high probability and relatively narrow prediction interval. For example, if a true observed AEDC of a child is 40, a 95% of our prediction will fall between 40 &#x000b1; 2*0.711 (38.578, 41.422).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec019"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="sec020"><title>Main findings</title><p>The study has applied a novel methodological approach to estimate how risk factors combine to predict child development (school readiness), at age five, within a life course conceptual framework. Our study demonstrates different predictive models for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children. The models are fit for explanation and for making out-of-sample prediction. The difference between predictive models for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children speaks to the need for a nuanced response that addresses the separate influences for the two groups of children. A limitation for the model is that the AEDC construct for measuring child development (school readiness) was not balanced across all domains. For Aboriginal children the variation in AEDC outcomes between children was influenced by measurement in only three domains&#x02013;emotional maturity, social competence, and language and cognitive skills (school-based) while for non-Aboriginal children only the single domain of language and cognitive skills (school-based) was influential in variation in AEDC measurement between children.</p><p>Our study demonstrated that, for Aboriginal children, the prediction of school readiness was influenced by a wider range of clusters, including maternal and pre-pregnancy factors (community-level socio-demographic disadvantage), child-related factors (English as second language and not attending preschool), and pregnancy factors (gestational diabetes and maternal smoking). Community-level sociodemographic disadvantage explained 51%, child-related factors explained 37% and pregnancy factors explained 12% of the influential paths to the AEDC outcome. For non-Aboriginal children, the prediction of child development (school readiness) is dominated by the direct effects of maternal and pre-pregnancy factors, with teen-age pregnancy, increased parity, community-level sociodemographic disadvantage and lower-level of occupation of the primary carer predicting increased vulnerability and lower school readiness. Parity contributed 47%, teenage pregnancy 27%, community-level sociodemographic disadvantage 13.2% and occupation 13% of the variation within a cluster of pre-pregnancy factors. The models also demonstrated the interplay of these factors in predicting child development (school readiness). For example, for Aboriginal children, pregnancy and child-related factors partially mediated the link between pre-pregnancy and AEDC outcomes (explaining 42% of the total variation in pre-pregnancy factors); and child-related factors fully mediate the link between pregnancy factors and AEDC outcomes. Most of these risk factors have been previously reported to explain child language and cognitive development in first year of formal schooling [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The identified predictors of child development (school readiness) in our study are also consistent with a previous explanatory study in NT [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and predictive studies conducted in other states of Australia using a dichotomous AEDC outcome measure for AEDC [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>].</p><p>Despite the limitation of the modelled outcome not being explained equally by all AEDC domains, this study provides insight into areas in which efforts should be made to improve child development (school readiness). Most importantly, the predictive model highlights the cluster of factors in which there should be focus for improving a model for early identification of children at higher risk of development and school readiness. The model also informs how risk factors appearing at different times in the life course are interrelated in their influence on development. Our analysis is consistent with recent recommendation promoting a life course approach (from conception to the first three years) to childhood development [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>].</p><p>The generalizability and validity of the predictive models are subject to the following limitations. First, the poor fit of the formatively measured domains of the AEDC for both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal population limits the potential prediction of an AEDC construct that encompasses five developmental domains. A previous validation study reported the Australian version of the Early Development Instrument (AvEDI) as valid [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. However, this validation study specified the five AEDC domains as reflective measures although they theoretically appear to be distinct concepts that should be constructed as formative [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Our study fitted the five domains as formative measures of AEDC and found that only three domains for Aboriginal children (emotional maturity, language and cognitive skills (school-based), and social competence) and one domain for non-Aboriginal children (language and cognitive skills (school-based)) were relevant and significant. Further investigation is required to determine if the poor fit of the AEDC measure is a consequence of the ability of the measure to discriminate varying levels of performance between children or whether some children were inappropriately assessed during data collection. Reliable data collection requires an ongoing investment in training for teachers and in the provision of classroom assistance (including Aboriginal education support) during collection. Second, our assumption that the predictors measured for children at age five were the same at the time the mother was pregnant may not be true, which affects temporal validity. However, the use of this theoretical framework of child development (school readiness) to conceptualize the causal relationship of these predictors is legitimate [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Third, the much higher level of missing data for individual-level variables for NT Aboriginal children (for example maternal education missing for 41% of Aboriginal children compared with 20% of non-Aboriginal children) may have introduced a level of bias into the estimates. A fourth limitation is that the homogeneity of some covariates across the population may reduce the discriminatory ability of individual-level variables for Aboriginal children. As an example, among children with maternal education information, 63% of Aboriginal children have maternal education level recorded as not completing school, compared to 25% of non-Aboriginal children. As such, our analysis might understate a gradient in the association between individual-level markers of socio-economic disadvantage and school readiness for Aboriginal children. A previous study of risks and protective factors for school readiness among Australian Aboriginal children reported the importance of parent education and emphasized the benefit of maternal high school completion [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. A fifth limitation is that potentially important covariates such as maternal mental health (pre and postnatal period), exposure to family violence, child parenting practice, maternal nutrition during pregnancy and childhood nutritional status were not available and should be considered for future studies.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Policy implications</title><p>Our findings have several policy implications. Our study demonstrated the high prevalence of socio-economic disadvantage experienced by NT Aboriginal children from pre-natal period and extending through early childhood largely occurred at the community-level, suggesting the importance of &#x02018;place-based&#x02019; strategies such as an integrated services model for early childhood services and Aboriginal community and health services [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. The demonstrated benefit of preschool attendance and negative influence of a non-English background for school readiness, for Aboriginal children, speaks to the importance of preschool participation and English language support at school entry in remote communities.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Place-based strategies</title><p>Research, both international and in Australia, has identified that integrated services are more effective in meeting the needs of communities and families whose personal resources are continually compromised by more urgent, complex and multiple needs. An example of discontinuity between services experienced by many families is the transition between preschool and school. For many Aboriginal children there is a cultural and linguistic gap between home and school or home and other service providers. Integrated or seamless preschool and early childhood care and education programs could be a way to provide early experiences of &#x02018;schooling culture&#x02019; and support successful transitions to Western-style school. In Australia, several long-established not-for-profit early childhood service providers have developed integrated models to meet their clients&#x02019; needs more effectively. For example, in Western Australia, Ngala provides a range of universal, targeted and intensive services, including early childhood education and care, parenting groups and overnight support for mothers and babies [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Other examples of long-established organizations developing integrated programs in Australia includes Best chance Child and Family Care in Victoria [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], The Infants&#x02019; Home in New South Wales [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], Gowrie in South Australia [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], the Doveton high-quality education and wrap-around community-service model in Victoria [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>], and Tasmania&#x02019;s child and family centres [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Though these place-based learning centres had a long history, their effectiveness has not been comprehensively evaluated with the exceptions of Tasmania&#x02019;s child and family centre and the Doveton community service model where recent studies have reported the learning centres as a welcoming place to develop positive child and family outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. A Productivity Commission report in 2020 commented on the continuing fragmentation of early childhood services in the NT resulting in ongoing gaps and duplication of funding to services which often did not address community interests or needs [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Future directions should be guided by studies that unpack the school-related or community factors that enable improved educational outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Preschool and provision of English language support</title><p>Our study also demonstrates that two immediately available strategies for improving school readiness and educational outcome are preschool and the provision of English language support for Aboriginal children throughout schooling, including late exit bilingual models where feasible. This finding supports the inclusion of the new Closing the Gap targets relating to Aboriginal educational outcomes to increase the enrolment and participation in early childhood education to 95% by 2025 [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. A review of interventions designed to improve school readiness of Aboriginal children revealed that &#x0201c;<italic toggle="yes">high quality evidence is sparse and effective interventions are few in number</italic>&#x0201d;. While the importance of preschool is widely acknowledged, a previous NT study indicated that the initial benefits of preschool can &#x02018;fade out&#x02019; unless they are reinforced by regular attendance and effective engagement with school learning in the early years of primary school [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Silburn et al highlighted the necessity of policy and services supporting children&#x02019;s transition into formal school learning extending through to at least Year 3 [<xref rid="pone.0296051.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec024"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This predictive model for child development (school readiness) identified separate models for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children in the NT. For Aboriginal children the most influential predictors are community-level sociodemographic disadvantage and preschool attendance both of which point to structural inequalities within policy and program design. The most influential predictors for non-Aboriginal children are maternal parity, maternal age, community level socio-demographic disadvantage, and maternal occupation. The models give insight into the interplay of these factors at different stages of a child&#x02019;s development and informs service and policy responses such as language diversity and cultural inclusion to improve school education outcomes. However, the measurement of AEDC domains and educator&#x02019;s assessment practice needs to be reviewed to ensure balanced discernment of all five domains of measurement.</p></sec><sec id="sec025" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0296051.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Predictive model.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0296051.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the support by the NT Government Departments of Health; Education; Territory Families, Housing and Communities; Attorney General and Justice; Chief Minister and Cabinet; Treasury and Finance; and Police, Fire and Emergency Services, through the Child and Youth Development Research Partnership (CYDRP).

After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#x02019;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.<!-- </div> --><!-- <div> -->&#x000a0;<!-- </div> --><!-- <div> -->As you can see below, the reviews are mixed, with R1 being the more positive of the two; though they still point to a number of areas in need of attention. R2 calls for the voices of First Nations people to be integrated more completely in the manuscript and for the need to address assumptions that Indigenous children will be forced into a non-Indigenous school system. Other points raised and as these are clear I will not repeat them here. But needless to say, all need to be addressed.</p><p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Oct 26 2022 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at&#x000a0;<email>plosone@plos.org</email>.

I have a few comments that need to be addressed:</p><p>1. In your Discussion, can you clarify what is novel in your findings? On page 26 you state that much of what you found has been found before - so can you elaborate on what is truly new?</p><p>2. Abstract - in your Conclusion, which aspects of a child's development need to be captured equally - ie are there dimensions missing which should be highlighted in the abstract?</p><p>3. On page 5, for ref 50, can you add in the year of the finding that only 41% of Aboriginal children attended pre-school?</p><p>4. Design and Population - when you say you used unit-record level data, does unit= the child? Would be clearer to say this</p><p>5. Covariates- in your Discussion, can you say what key covariates you think are missing from the available datasets that should be captured in any future datasets? eg family violence? parenting? quality of preschool? other key determinants of child development?</p><p>6. Data analysis - for your logistic regression for non-Aboriginal children, how did you decide on your cut point (I may have missed this)?</p><p>7. By using CCA approach, you lost a number of children - can you say how those included vs dropped differed? Does this have any implications for the generalisability of your findings?</p><p>8. On page 29, you discuss the need for "integrated or seamless preschool and early childhood care and education programs" ...easy to say but hard to do - can you give any examples of successful programs?</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;Thank you for the opportunity to read this manuscript. Clearly a lot of work went into it and tackles an important issue &#x02013; Aboriginal child development, an area of great importance to Aboriginal communities. Large sections of the paper are very well-written.</p><p>However, I have several major concerns. I struggled to hear the voices of Aboriginal communities and researchers in this work (apologies to any of the authors who are Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander). In recent years, a number of eminent Aboriginal researchers have tried to guide research in a new direction and I think this manuscript would be strengthened by following some of the recommendations of those researchers (e.g. Maggie Walter, Stephen Harfield&#x02019;s paper Assessing the quality of health research from an Indigenous perspective: the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander quality appraisal tool). In particular, this paper would benefit from being written from a strengths-based perspective. Also, Aboriginal should always have a capital &#x02018;A&#x02019; and this needs to be corrected in the supplementary material. Similarly, the noun &#x0201c;Aboriginals&#x0201d; could be replaced in the supplementary material with something like &#x0201c;Aboriginal people&#x0201d;.</p><p>I felt there was sometimes a blurring of the distinct concepts of child development, readiness for a school system that was not set up for Aboriginal children, and AEDC scores. I think the manuscript could benefit from being careful to articulate which concept is being referred to throughout.</p><p>Could the authors provide more detail about why the AEDC scores were measured formatively &#x02013; I would have thought that the construct (child development) informs the indicators (AEDC scores), rather than the other way around, so a more detailed explanation or diagram would help (I note that Fig 1 has been included, but I assume that the correct reading of Fig 1 is that &#x02018;true&#x02019; physical health and well-being informs &#x02018;true&#x02019; child development and the AEDC score for physical health is not in this figure, but if it was, there would be an arrow from &#x02018;true&#x02019; physical health and well-being to AEDC score).</p><p>Underlying the discussion appears to be an assumption that Aboriginal children should be prepared to a school system set up largely by non-Aboriginal people. I note that many Aboriginal families would like the system to fit to their children&#x02019;s needs rather than the other way round.</p><p>The results from the complete case analysis (CCA), indicator variable for missing data approach and MICE (Supplementary Table 1) were very different &#x02013; some variables were significant CCA but not the other approaches and some coefficients changed direction. Given this, how would their conclusions have changed if MICE was the preferred approach?</p><p>I am curious about the finding that missingness did not depend on the outcome. Looking at Table 1, missingness was much more common among Aboriginal children and AEDC scores were lower for Aboriginal children, so I would have expected an association between missingness and AEDC scores. It would be interesting to see data on AEDC scores for children missing data vs AEDC scores for children not missing data. How did the authors conclude missingness did not depend on the outcome?</p><p>Some of the data analysis section is hard to follow and could be rewritten and restructured so it is clearer what the aim of each step is and so that information flows in a logical order (e.g. &#x0201c;in-sample&#x0201d; appears at line 254, but &#x0201c;in-sample&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;out-of-sample&#x0201d; is not explained until later.</p><p>The decision-making about how the final models were selected is difficult to follow (e.g. line 324 &#x02013; it is not clear how the authors ended up with 17 competing models and how they went from those 17 to 4). There is mention of the supplementary material, but there appear to only be 15 models in the supplementary material and it&#x02019;s not clear what the 4 final models are, nor how the 2 presented in the main paper were chosen. Perhaps a diagram could explain this.</p><p>Minor suggestions/comments:</p><p>Line 121: Suggest rewriting the first sentence as not currently clear. However, the rest of this paragraph is very good and perhaps the ideas in this paragraph could inform the rest of the paper a bit more.</p><p>Line 182: Typo</p><p>Line 200: Specify the variables more exactly (e.g. what were the categories of education and employment?)</p><p>Line 223: Explain what total AEDC summary scale scores are</p><p>Line 229 and 230: What are these models? What is the binary outcome for the non-Aboriginal children?</p><p>Line 238: Include how many children were excluded and on what grounds.</p><p>Line 323: What does &#x0201c;Added percentile of AEDC domains&#x0201d; mean? Need to clarify that p-values at the end of Table 1 are for comparisons of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children while p-values for the rest of the table for comparisons of AEDC values and the variable.</p><p>**********</p><p><!-- <font color="black"> -->6.

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters)<!-- </font> --></p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;I don't believe the authors have adequately addressed my comment re missing data, or Reviewer 1's comment, and in the process of re-reading it, I realised the authors may not have accurately described the recommendations laid out in the two papers on missing data that they referenced.</p><p>It was not clear from what they wrote whether the authors thought their data were missing at random (MAR) or missing not at random (MNAR). They wrote &#x0201c;Missingness in the covariates was related to the outcome variable. Children who missed observation on these variables were more likely to be developmentally vulnerable in one or two domains. So, missingness was not random and Multiple Imputation would introduce bias. CCA is the appropriate method.&#x0201d; Having missingness in the covariates related to the outcome variable, does not (of itself) distinguish between MAR (which, despite its name, is not completely random) and MNAR and there is no 'test' to distinguish between MAR and MNAR. Given that it is hard to know whether data is MAR or MNAR, it is also not always clear whether CCA or MI is preferable and often both are used and the results compared.</p><p>Despite this, the authors claim that CCA is preferable, &#x0201c;In this case, methodological studies have reported that multiple imputation (MI) tends to be biased away from the null and complete case analysis (CCA) is a better approach (83, 84)&#x0201d;, I note that reference 84 actually starts the Discussion section with &#x0201c;Our comparison of MAR-based MI with CC analysis for regression models with one or two incomplete covariates shows no universally consistent advantage of one method over the other, although MI appears to be superior across a wider range of settings.&#x0201c; For reference 83, despite the title &#x0201c;Accounting for missing data in statistical analyses: multiple imputation is not always the answer&#x0201d;, the authors themselves chose MI for the analysis they were interested in.</p><p>Given all of this, the approach of doing both CCA and MI in this study was welcome, but the results from both approaches should be discussed. Re-reading my comment, I realise I could have made this point more clearly. The case is better made in Sterne JA, White IR, Carlin JB, Spratt M, Royston P, Kenward MG, Wood AM, Carpenter JR. Multiple imputation for missing data in epidemiological and clinical research: potential and pitfalls. Bmj.</p><p>&#x0201c;Where complete cases and multiple imputation analyses give different results, the analyst should attempt to understand why, and this should be reported in publications.&#x0201d;</p><p>The sentence &#x0201c;In this case, methodological studies have reported that multiple imputation (MI) tends to be biased away from the null and complete case analysis (CCA) is a better approach (83, 84)&#x0201d; needs to be re-written to better reflect the content of the papers they are referencing.</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#x000a0;Given this paper has already been reviewed by others, I have focused my attention on the response of the authors to the original reviewer comments&#x02014;although I have a few additional (minor) comments on other aspects of the paper. Overall, I thought the paper was well written, included a thorough approach to the analysis and is centred on an important topic in research, policy and practice.</p><p>My main area of concern was highlighted by Reviewer 1 (point 6): and concerned the approach to dealing with data missing not at random. The authors response suggests that a CCA is preferred to a multiple imputation approach. This may be the case but I am not an expert in these methodological issues &#x02013; my readings suggest, on balance, that this is a fair argument. However, it remains the fact that around 52-60% of the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal sample were included in the final prediction models. Given this scale of missingness and likelihood of bias, this appears to me to be a major issue in terms of the impact on the selection of variables and estimated effects. The sensitivity analysis, which highlights differences in the results between the CCA and MICE analyses, doesn&#x02019;t appear to ease this concern.</p><p>Perhaps part of the issue here is the (from what I can tell) reliance on Model I results in informing the selection of variables in the prediction models &#x02013; there appears to be a significantly smaller sample for the CCA analysis compared with Models II and III.</p><p>In any case, all of this, of course, places limitations on the implications of the final model results for policy and practice&#x02014;and while the issues of bias are mentioned as a limitation, I&#x02019;m not sure the authors do enough to discuss this concern or asses the likelihood of it not being serious.</p><p>Additional comments</p><p>- The terms &#x02018;positive&#x02019; and &#x02018;poorer&#x02019; outcomes in the Abstract should be defined or a more specific term used. It also wasn&#x02019;t clear to me what was meant by the term &#x02018;not equally captured&#x02019;</p><p>- I would have preferred the Conclusion of the Abstract to tell us what factors are important, based on the model results</p><p>- First para of page 5: assume this relates to all Australian children (not just NT)?</p><p>- Page 15, line 319: should clarify that the univariable association is with the AEDC total score (although the effect is not reported; instead it reflects that there was a significant association); also, from what I can tell, these are associations in the regression models of step 1 as opposed to the predictive model? If I have interpreted this correctly then a few tweaks need to be made to the text and the table titles that follow</p><p>- Page 30: the inclusion of more details on place-based strategies is very useful. Is there any information on whether these have been evaluated and therefore effective?</p><p>- Page 31 (Conclusion): I don&#x02019;t disagree that SES and preschool attendance are implicated in structural inequalities, however, I&#x02019;m not sure that the presence of these factors in the model for Aboriginal children suggests this given it is a within-Aboriginal sample model.</p><p>**********</p><p><!-- <font color="black"> -->7.

I apologise it has taken so long to respond to you which has been largely due to our endeavours to find Indigenous researchers with an interest in this topic willing to review this paper. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONE&#x02019;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process particularly around how you have handled the missing data.</p><p>Please submit your revised manuscript by Jan 05 2024 11:59PM. If you will need more time than this to complete your revisions, please reply to this message or contact the journal office at&#x000a0;<email>plosone@plos.org</email>. When you're ready to submit your revision, log on to <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pone/</ext-link> and select the 'Submissions Needing Revision' folder to locate your manuscript file.</p><p>Please include the following items when submitting your revised manuscript:<!-- </div> --><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A rebuttal letter that responds to each point raised by the academic editor and reviewer(s). You should upload this letter as a separate file labeled 'Response to Reviewers'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A marked-up copy of your manuscript that highlights changes made to the original version. You should upload this as a separate file labeled 'Revised Manuscript with Track Changes'.</p></list-item><list-item><p>An unmarked version of your revised paper without tracked changes.

Guidelines for resubmitting your figure files are available below the reviewer comments at the end of this letter.</p><p>If applicable, we recommend that you deposit your laboratory protocols in protocols.io to enhance the reproducibility of your results. Protocols.io assigns your protocol its own identifier (DOI) so that it can be cited independently in the future.

</p><p>1. If the authors have adequately addressed your comments raised in a previous round of review and you feel that this manuscript is now acceptable for publication, you may indicate that here to bypass the &#x0201c;Comments to the Author&#x0201d; section, enter your conflict of interest statement in the &#x0201c;Confidential to Editor&#x0201d; section, and submit your "Accept" recommendation.<!-- </font> --></p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;(No Response)</p><p>**********</p><p><!-- <font color="black"> -->2. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?</p><p>The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions.

This version states, &#x0201c;Furthermore, we also checked that the missingness was not dependent on the outcome (AEDC) after adjusting for the other covariates&#x0201d;. It is not clear how this was checked and there has a confusing history about the nature of the missing data.</p><p>In the first draft, the authors stated that missingness was not dependent on the outcome. When this was queried, based on results in Table 1, the authors advised that this was an error and revised the text to, &#x0201c;missingness was associated with the outcome (AEDC) i.e., children who missed observation on these variables were more likely to developmentally vulnerable on one or two domains&#x0201d;. In this version, they state that missingness is not dependent on the outcome after adjusting for the other covariates.</p><p>Unfortunately, the authors did not provide evidence to support this new statement, nor a description of the methodology used. If there is no association between missingness and the outcome, conditional on the other covariates, I accept that the references used are appropriate. If not, my recommendation would remain that:</p><p>- No new analysis is required. Only some revision of the written material is required.</p><p>- Multiple approaches are appropriate</p><p>- Differences in results between the complete case analysis and the 2 sensitivity analyses should be discussed</p><p>- The wording around those references should be changed.</p><p>**********</p><p><!-- <font color="black"> -->7.
