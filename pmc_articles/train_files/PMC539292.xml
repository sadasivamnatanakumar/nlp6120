The CAA observed in both Alzheimer's disease patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and some of the transgenic mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] is primarily composed of the shorter form of amyloid beta (A&#x003b2;), A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;40</sub>, while the majority of amyloid deposits in the parenchyma are composed of A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;42</sub>, although the compact amyloid deposits also contain A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;40</sub>.</p><p>Anti-A&#x003b2; immunotherapy has been considered as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease for some time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Active immunization with a vaccine including A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;42 </sub>fibrils progressed to human clinical trials where its administration was suspended due to meningoencephalitits in a subset of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. To date there have been pathology reports on two patients who participated in the trial and subsequently died [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Both reports note that while the numbers of parenchymal amyloid deposits appeared lower than expected in these cases, the CAA in these patients did not appear outside the normal range for Alzheimer's disease. In addition, one report mentioned multiple cortical hemorrhages and the presence of hemosiderin around the CAA vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Given the adverse reactions to the active immunization, the irreversibility of such procedures and the variable antibody response to vaccines in older individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], passive immunization against the A&#x003b2; peptide emerged as an alternative immunotherapeutic strategy. Studies in young and middle aged APP-transgenic mice have reported significant amyloid reductions with passive immunization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Such treatments also demonstrate rapid improvements of memory function in APP-transgenic mice, sometimes without detectable reductions in amyloid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Most recently, intracranial administration of anti-A&#x003b2; antibodies has been shown to not only remove A&#x003b2; but also clear, early-stage, hyperphosphorylated-tau aggregates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Importantly, in the only prior study evaluating adoptive antibody transfer in older APP-transgenic mice, Pfeifer <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] reported a doubling of cerebral microhemorrhages associated with significant reductions in amyloid burden after administration of an N-terminal specific anti-A&#x003b2; antibody.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Experiment design</title><p>Mice derived from APP Tg2576 mice were obtained from our breeding program at University of South Florida started in 1996 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. For the 5-month treatment study, 13 APP-transgenic mice, aged 23 months, were assigned to one of two groups. The first group received weekly intraperitoneal anti-A&#x003b2; antibody injections (antibody 2286; mouse-monoclonal anti-human A&#x003b2;<sub>28&#x02013;40 </sub>IgG1; Rinat Neurosciences, Palo Alto, CA) for a period of 5 months (<italic>n </italic>= 6).

Seven nontransgenic mice were also assigned to one of two groups. The first group received weekly intraperitoneal anti-A&#x003b2; antibody injections for a period of 5 months (<italic>n </italic>= 4). The second group received weekly intraperitoneal anti-AMN antibody injections for a period of 5 months (<italic>n </italic>= 3).</p><p>For the time course study of 1-, 2- or 3-month treatment, 22 APP-transgenic mice aged 19 months were assigned to one of four experimental groups, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The first three groups received weekly intraperitoneal anti-A&#x003b2; antibody injections for 3 months, 2 months or 1 month, ending when all mice were 22 months of age. The fourth group received weekly intraperitoneal anti-AMN antibody injections for 3 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Behavioral analysis</title><p>Following 3 and 5 months of treatment, the mice from the 5-month study were subjected to a two-day radial-arm water-maze paradigm. The apparatus was a 6-arm maze as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. On day one, 15 trials were run in three blocks of 5. A cohort of 4 mice were run sequentially for each block (i.e., each of 4 mice get trial one, then the same mice get trial two, etc.). After each 5-trial block, a second cohort of mice was run permitting an extended rest period before mice were exposed to the second block of 5 trials. The goal arm was different for each mouse in a cohort to minimize odor cues. The start arm was varied for each trial, with the goal arm remaining constant for a given individual for both days. For the first 11 trials, the platform was alternately visible then hidden (hidden for the last 4 trials). On day two, the mice were run in exactly the same manner as day one except that the platform was hidden forall trials. The number of errors (incorrect arm entries) was measured in a one-minute time frame. As standard practice, mice failing to make an arm choice in 20 seconds are assigned one error, but no mice in this study had to be assigned an error in this manner. The same individual administered the antibody treatments and placed mice in the radial-arm water maze. Due to the numbers of mice in the study the researcher was unaware of treatment group identity of each mouse. Also, the dependent measures in the radial-arm water-maze task are quantitative, not evaluative, so the potential for tester bias is reduced. In order to minimize the influence of individual trial variability, each mouse's errors for 3 consecutive trials were averaged producing 5 data points for each day, which were analyzed statistically by ANOVA using StatView (SAS Institute Inc., NC).</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue preparation and histology</title><p>On the day of sacrifice mice were weighed, overdosed with 100 mg/kg Nembutal (Abbott laboratories, North Chicago, IL), and then intracardially perfused with 25 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride. Brains were rapidly removed, and the left half of the brain was immersion fixed for 24 h in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in 100 mM KPO<sub>4 </sub>(pH 7.2) for histopathology. The hemi-brains were then incubated for 24 h in 10%, 20% and 30% sucrose sequentially for cyroprotection. Horizontal sections of 25 &#x003bc; thickness were collected using a sliding microtome and stored at 4&#x000b0;C in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline with sodium azide (pH 7.2) to prevent microbial growth. A series of 8 equally spaced tissue sections 600 &#x003bc; apart were randomly selected spanning the entire brain and stained using free-floating immunohistochemistry for total A&#x003b2; (rabbit polyclonal anti-pan A&#x003b2;; Biosource, Camarillo, CA, 1:10,000) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. A second series of tissue sections 600 &#x003bc;m apart were stained using 0.2% Congo red in NaCl-saturated 80% ethanol. Another set of sections were also mounted and stained for hemosiderin using 2% potassium ferrocyanide in 2% hydrochloric acid for 15 min, followed by a counterstain in a 1% neutral red solution for 10 min. Quantification of Congo red staining and A&#x003b2; immunohistochemistry was performed using the Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD) to analyze the percent area occupied by positive stain. One region of the frontal cortex and three regions of the hippocampus were analyzed (to ensure that there was no regional bias in the hippocampal values). The initial analysis of Congo red was performed to give a total value. A second analysis was performed after manually editing out all of the parenchymal amyloid deposits to yield a percent area restricted to vascular Congo red staining. To estimate the parenchymal area of Congo red, we subtracted the vascular amyloid values from the total percentage. For the hemosiderin stain the numbers of Prussian blue-positive sites were counted on all sections and the average number of sites per section calculated. Looking at the sections at a low magnification we were able to observe a qualitative differences between animals; however, the percent area was so low that many fields contained no positive stain. Eight equally spaced sections were examined and the number of positive profiles was determined and averaged to a per-section value. To assess possible treatment-related differences, the values for each treatment group were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Fisher's LSD means comparisons.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Reversal of cognitive deficits by passive amyloid immunotherapy</title><p>The radial-arm water-maze task detects spatial learning and memory deficits in transgenic mouse models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

At both testing times we found that APP-transgenic mice treated with the control antibody failed to learn platform location over two days of testing and were significantly impaired compared to the nontransgenic mice treated with either antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). However, APP-transgenic mice administered the anti-A&#x003b2; antibodies demonstrated a complete reversal of the impairment observed in the control-treated APP-transgenic mice, ending day two with a mean performance near 0.5 errors per trial (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Although learning at the later time point, when the mice were 28 months of age, may have been slightly slower for all groups, there was no impairment of the anti-A&#x003b2; antibody-treated APP.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Spatial learning deficits in APP-transgenic mice were reversed following 3 and 5 months of immunization.

Passive immunization protocols with anti-A&#x003b2; antibodies also produced cognitive benefits, in some cases even in the absence of significant reduction in amyloid burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Our recent work found that 3 months of anti-A&#x003b2; treatment of 18-month-old APP-transgenic mice improved spontaneous alternation performance on the Y-maze [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In the present work we confirmed that passive anti-amyloid immunotherapy can reverse spatial learning deficits in APP-transgenic mice and that this benefit of immunotherapy is retained, even in aged mice (26 and 28 months old at testing) with long-established amyloid pathology.</p><p>Additionally, we describe a more rapid means of testing spatial reference memory to reveal learning and memory deficits in APP-transgenic mice. This two-day version of the radial arm water maze included greater spacing of individual trials (mice spent time in their home cage after every trial), combined with less spacing of aggregate trials (fifteen trials per day rather than four or five) to facilitate learning of platform location in the nontransgenic mice, with a clear absence of learning in the age-matched transgenic mice.</p><p>A substantial reduction in total Congophilic amyloid deposits was observed in old APP-transgenic mice treated with anti-A&#x003b2; antibodies for 2 or more months. This measurement of total Congo-red staining included both parenchymal and vascular amyloid staining. When we analyzed the sections for only vascular amyloid (CAA) we found that this measure was significantly increased following 2, 3 and 5 months of anti-A&#x003b2; antibody treatment. The remaining parenchymal amyloid load was almost completely eliminated with this antibody approach. Clearly, because total amyloid load was significantly reduced not all amyloid was shifted into the vessels; but, it appears that at least some of the Congophilic material was redistributed to the vasculature. At the present time the mechanism for this redistribution is unclear. However, one possibility is that the microglia associated with the antibody-opsonized amyloid, either by phagocytosis or surface binding, and transported the material to the vasculature, possibly in an attempt to expel it. We and others have shown evidence for microglial involvement in the removal of amyloid using both intracranial anti-A&#x003b2; antibody injections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and systemically administered anti-A&#x003b2; antibody treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], as well as <italic>ex vivo </italic>studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Here we also report our impression that microglia surrounding CAA vessels in immunized mice expressed more CD45 than control transgenic mice. This increased expression could be due to either increased expression in the same number of microglial cells or an increased number of microglial cells in these animals. It is feasible that this microglial activation was simply in reaction to the presence of increased amyloid in the blood vessels. However, it is equally likely that microglia activated by the opsonized material migrated to the vessels for disposal of the amyloid.</p><p>Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is defined as the deposition of congophilic material in meningeal and cerebral arteries and arterioles (capillaries and veins can also show CAA but less frequently), and it occurs to some extent in nearly all Alzheimer's disease patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Severe CAA, affecting about 15% of cases, can be associated with both infarction and hemorrhagic injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. It has also been shown that the severity of CAA can be directly linked to the severity of dementia in Alzheimer's disease patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>In the current study we found a significantly increased number of microhemorrhages in the brain as detected by Prussian-blue staining, associated with the increase in CAA following passive immunization. Another transgenic mouse model of amyloid deposition, the APP23 mice, have been shown to deposit amyloid in both brain parenchyma and blood vessels and show a CAA associated increase in spontaneous cerebral hemorrhages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Moreover, Pfeifer <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] showed that these spontaneous hemorrhages were significantly increased following 5 months of passive immunization of 21-month-old APP23 mice using an anti-A&#x003b2; antibody with an N-terminal epitope, similar to those typically developed in active immunization with vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. When young mice (6 months of age) were immunized following the same protocol, no hemorrhages were observed. More recently, DeMattos <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] showed that passive immunization with an N-terminal antibody (3D6: directed against amino acids 1&#x02013;5 of A&#x003b2;) of PDAPP transgenic mice also resulted in significantly increased microhemorrhage. They were unable to detect increased microhemorrhage with a mid-domain antibody (266: directed against amino acids 13&#x02013;28 of A&#x003b2;). Notably, antibody 266 fails to bind A&#x003b2; deposited in CAA vessels or amyloid plaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Importantly, Ferrer <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] noted the presence of CAA and microhemorrhage in the brain of one patient that participated in the A&#x003b2;-vaccine trial, even though the parenchymal amyloid appeared lower than expected. Also, Nicoll <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] noted that CAA appeared unaffected in the brain of another patient that participated in the A&#x003b2;-vaccine trial.</p><p>It remains to be determined whether these observations regarding increased CAA and microhemorrhage in transgenic mice are relevant to trials of passive immunotherapy in humans. It should be noted that, in spite of extending the period of immunotherapy to 5 months, there was no discernable loss of the cognitive benefits of immunotherapy in the transgenic mice, all of whom showed increased microhemorrhage. While the observation that antibody 266 does not result in vascular leakage encourages testing of this idiotype, data from the Zurich cohort of the A&#x003b2; vaccine trial argue that brain-reactive antibodies may be important for cognitive benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our opinion is that these results suggest that passive immunotherapy against A&#x003b2; should proceed with appropriate precautions taken to minimize the risk of hemorrhage (e.g., by excluding patients taking anticoagulants) and instituting measures to detect such hemorrhages if they do occur, irrespective of the antibody specificity or proclivity for microhemorrhage in aged APP-transgenic mice.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>A&#x003b2; : Amyloid-beta.</p><p>APP: Amyloid precursor protein</p><p>CAA: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy.</p><p>IgG1: Immunoglobulin G type 1.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>DMW treated the mice, performed the behavioral analysis, processed the tissue and performed pathological analyses, and drafted the manuscript.
