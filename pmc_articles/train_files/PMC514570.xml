Retinoid X receptor &#x003b1; (RXR&#x003b1;), the most highly expressed RXR isoform in liver, plays a central role in regulating bile acid, cholesterol, fatty acid, steroid and xenobiotic metabolism and homeostasis. Many of the genes regulated by RXR&#x003b1; are repressed during the negative hepatic APR, although the underlying mechanism is not known. We hypothesized that inflammation-induced alteration of the subcellular location of RXR&#x003b1; was a common mechanism underlying the negative hepatic APR.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Nuclear RXR&#x003b1; protein levels were significantly reduced (~50%) within 1&#x02013;2 hours after low-dose LPS treatment and remained so for at least 16 hours. RXR&#x003b1; was never detected in cytosolic extracts from saline-treated mice, yet was rapidly and profoundly detectable in the cytosol from 1 hour, to at least 4 hours, after LPS administration. These effects were specific, since the subcellular localization of the RXR&#x003b1; partner, the retinoic acid receptor (RAR&#x003b1;), was unaffected by LPS. A potential cell-signaling modulator of RXR&#x003b1; activity, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) was maximally activated at 1&#x02013;2 hours, coincident with maximal levels of cytoplasmic RXR&#x003b1;. RNA levels of RXR&#x003b1; were unchanged, while expression of 6 sentinel hepatic genes regulated by RXR&#x003b1; were all markedly repressed after LPS treatment. This is likely due to reduced nuclear binding activities of regulatory RXR&#x003b1;-containing heterodimer pairs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The subcellular localization of native RXR&#x003b1; rapidly changes in response to LPS administration, correlating with induction of cell signaling pathways. This provides a novel and broad-ranging molecular mechanism for the suppression of RXR&#x003b1;-regulated genes in inflammation.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>liver</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>endotoxin</kwd><kwd>RXR</kwd><kwd>JNK</kwd><kwd>nuclear export</kwd><kwd>nuclear receptor</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>LPS, a major constituent of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, potently stimulates host innate immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. LPS-induced activation of monocytes/macrophages leads to the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;) in addition to other mediators such as cysteinyl leukotrienes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. LPS and LPS-induced cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of a variety of liver diseases, including cholestasis, as well as being principal mediators of the negative hepatic APR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The cholestatic effect of LPS is primarily due to cytokine-mediated inhibition of the function and expression of hepatic genes encoding critical proteins involved in bile formation and transport (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]). These hepatocellular transporters include the basolateral sodium/taurocholate cotransporter (<italic>Ntcp/Slc10a1</italic>) and organic anion transporting proteins (<italic>Oatp1/Slc21a1</italic>), as well as the canalicular multispecific organic anion exporter (<italic>Mrp2/Abcc2</italic>) and the bile salt export protein (<italic>Bsep/Abcb11</italic>). Transcriptional down-regulation of the principal hepatic bile acid importer, Ntcp contributes to the reduction in bile acid uptake by hepatocytes in inflammation, whereas reduced Mrp2 expression leads to impaired excretion of conjugated bilirubin, glutathione and other organic anions into bile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Recent reports have provided insights into the link between inflammation-mediated cell signaling and regulation of bile acid homeostasis in the liver. Geier <italic>et al</italic>. showed that LPS-mediated suppression of <italic>Ntcp </italic>RNA was almost completely blocked by pre-treatment with anti-IL-1&#x003b2; specific antibodies, indicating that the cholestatic effects of LPS on the expression of this gene may be primarily mediated by the cell signaling pathways initiated by this one cytokine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We have shown that IL-1&#x003b2; treatment of HepG2 cells, or primary rat hepatocytes, leads to JNK-dependent repression of nuclear binding activity of the <italic>Ntcp </italic>transactivator, RXR&#x003b1;:RAR&#x003b1;, with consequent down-regulation of <italic>Ntcp </italic>promoter activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Finally, LPS, cytokines, and activated JNK have been linked to reduced expression of the rate-limiting enzyme in the bile acid biosynthetic pathway, cholesterol 7&#x003b1;-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), thus linking inflammatory signaling in the liver to the known and coordinated suppression of both bile acid import and synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. How activated JNK leads to reduced RXR&#x003b1; function is not known, but is likely to involve direct phosphorylation of RXR&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Phosphorylation of nuclear receptors (NRs) is a rapid and potentially powerful means of regulating NR activity, that, depending upon the NR, can affect transcriptional activity, protein stability, sub-cellular localization, protein-protein interactions or DNA binding activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Phosphorylation of transfected RXR&#x003b1; was reported to alter its transactivation properties in vitro, however, a definite functional role for native RXR&#x003b1; phosphorylation remains controversial. Both enhanced and reduced proteasome-mediated RXR&#x003b1; degradation have been associated with RXR&#x003b1; phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Hyperphosphorylation of RXR&#x003b1; by JNK was reported by Adam-Stitah <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and the phosphorylation sites were mapped to several residues (serines 61 and 75 and threonine 87) in the N-terminal region and serine 265 in the ligand binding domain of mouse RXR&#x003b1;. However, JNK-mediated hyperphosphorylation of RXR&#x003b1; did not affect the transactivation properties of transfected RXR&#x003b1; homodimers or RXR&#x003b1;:RAR&#x003b1; heterodimers in cultured cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In contrast, we and others have demonstrated that phosphorylation of RXR&#x003b1; by JNK signaling pathways is associated with reduced RXR&#x003b1;-dependent promoter activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Clearly, the consequences of RXR&#x003b1; phosphorylation are complex and poorly understood.</p><p>NR ligands and extracellular signal-mediated pathways can alter subcellular NR localization, some of which involves phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The xenobiotic receptors, CAR (NR1I3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and PXR (NR1I2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] are localized in the cytoplasm of mouse hepatocytes and translocated into the nucleus after administration of their respective ligands. GR and VDR are well-known to undergo ligand-dependent nuclear import in transfected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In contrast to the well-described events leading to NR nuclear import, little is known about NR nuclear export, including RXR&#x003b1;. Perhaps the best understood example of cell signaling targeting of NR nuclear export is JNK-mediated phosphorylation of GR, as a means of terminating GR-mediated transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Such a mechanism for RXR&#x003b1; has never been shown, although a reduction in nuclear RXR&#x003b1; protein levels has been demonstrated in an animal model of obstructive cholestasis induced by bile duct ligation, raising the possibility of nuclear export [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>In these studies, we sought to determine whether alterations in RXR&#x003b1;-dependent hepatic gene expression seen in inflammation may be related to nucleo-cytoplasmic re-distribution of RXR&#x003b1;. LPS treatment resulted in the activation of hepatic JNK coinciding with marked reduction in nuclear RXR&#x003b1; levels, and the rapid appearance of RXR&#x003b1; in the cytosol. RNA levels of <italic>RXR&#x003b1; </italic>and six of its heterodimeric partners highly expressed in liver were analyzed after LPS treatment: <italic>RXR&#x003b1;</italic>, <italic>RAR&#x003b1;</italic>, <italic>FXR </italic>(farnesoid X receptor) and <italic>PPAR&#x003b1; </italic>(peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor) RNA levels were stable, whereas <italic>CAR </italic>(constitutive androstane receptor) and <italic>PXR </italic>(pregnane X receptor) RNA levels were markedly suppressed and <italic>LXR </italic>(liver X receptor) RNA was elevated. Hepatic RNA levels of multiple RXR&#x003b1; target genes whose expression depends upon adequate nuclear levels of RXR&#x003b1; were significantly reduced by LPS. This is likely to be a consequence of reduced nuclear binding activity of RXR&#x003b1; heterodimer pairs. Notably, the reduction in RXR&#x003b1; nuclear protein levels (~50%) quantitatively correlated with the reduction in RNA levels of RXR&#x003b1; target genes. Taken together, these studies indicate that post-translational modification and cellular re-distribution of RXR&#x003b1; coinciding with induction of cell signaling is a novel, broad-ranging, and rapid mechanism contributing to the negative hepatic APR phenotype in the inflamed liver.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>LPS activates hepatic JNK</title><p>In order to determine the in vivo role for LPS-induced activation of hepatic JNK, we first established a time course for JNK activation, by measuring phospho-JNK and phospho-c-Jun levels. Liver whole cell extracts were prepared at various time points from 1&#x02013;16 hours after injection with either LPS (2 &#x003bc;g/g bw) or vehicle (0.9% saline) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Phosphorylated JNK levels were maximal at 1&#x02013;2 hours, and significantly higher than saline-injected animals at all time points studied. Total JNK levels did not vary between vehicle and LPS-treated samples. c-Jun is a direct substrate for phospho-JNK, and phospho-c-Jun levels are a well-described indicator of JNK activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. LPS treatment led to maximal c-Jun phosphorylation at 1 to 2 hours, with a slight reduction at 4 and 6 hours, and was undetectable by 16 hours. Thus, in an animal model, LPS administration activates JNK signaling in the liver as early as 1 hour, with evidence for prolonged JNK activity lasting at least 6 hours.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>LPS activates JNK and leads to rapid nuclear export of RXR&#x003b1;. </bold>C57BL/6 male mice were injected IP with 0.9% saline (Sal) or 2 &#x003bc;g/g bw of <italic>Salmonella </italic>LPS.

However, whether such changes are observed in RXR&#x003b1; activity after LPS challenge in an animal model is unknown. As early as one hour after LPS treatment, the maximal point of JNK activation, nuclear RXR&#x003b1; levels were significantly reduced compared to control, and remained so for at least 16 hours after LPS treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). RXR&#x003b1; was not present in the cytoplasmic fraction at any time point after saline treatment, yet was robustly evident within one to two hours after LPS treatment, and decreased thereafter. Interestingly, immunoblot analysis of nuclear RXR&#x003b1; revealed a slower migrating species after LPS treatment (most evident in the 1 hour LPS sample), suggestive of LPS-induced post-translational modification. Notably, hepatic RAR&#x003b1; levels in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments were unchanged by LPS.</p><p>To confirm the intracellular localization of RXR&#x003b1; in liver, immunofluorescence staining was carried out in formalin-fixed liver tissues prepared from mice 1 h after saline or LPS injection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). In LPS-treated mouse livers, RXR&#x003b1; was clearly observed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of hepatocytes, whereas it remained exclusively nuclear in saline-treated controls. Thus, there is a rapid, dramatic, and specific subcellular re-distribution of hepatic RXR&#x003b1; in response to LPS-administration, coinciding with induction of cell signaling.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of LPS on steady-state mRNA levels of RXR&#x003b1; and its partners in the liver</title><p>One possible explanation for reduced nuclear RXR&#x003b1; levels could be suppression of hepatic <italic>RXR&#x003b1; </italic>RNA expression, as seen in response to higher doses of LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].

As examples of genes regulated by RXR&#x003b1; and its partners, we studied RNA expression of six sentinel hepatic genes regulated by various RXR&#x003b1; heterodimer pairs: <italic>Ntcp </italic>(RAR&#x003b1;), <italic>Bsep </italic>(FXR), <italic>Mrp2 </italic>(CAR, FXR, PXR), <italic>Cyp3A11 </italic>(CAR, PXR), <italic>Abcg5 </italic>(LXR&#x003b1;) and <italic>Lfabp </italic>(PPAR&#x003b1;) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). RNA levels of all of these hepatic RXR&#x003b1;-regulated genes were significantly reduced by LPS treatment. <italic>Ntcp</italic>, <italic>Bsep </italic>and <italic>Abcg5 </italic>RNA levels decreased by 50&#x02013;60%, <italic>Cyp3A11 </italic>RNA by 80%, while <italic>Lfabp </italic>and <italic>Mrp2 </italic>expression were each reduced approximately 60&#x02013;70% after LPS treatment. The comparatively greater reduction in Cyp3A11 gene expression can be attributed to the combined effects of diminished PXR and CAR RNA expression along with reduced nuclear RXR&#x003b1; protein levels; both PXR &#x00026; CAR activate Cyp3A11 gene expression (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]).</p><p>The orphan nuclear receptor SHP (small heterodimer protein, NR0B2) is known to repress the activities of RXR&#x003b1; and other NRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. One possibility is that LPS-mediated suppression of hepatic genes could be mediated by the activation of the repressor, SHP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, this is unlikely, since LPS treatment dramatically reduced SHP RNA levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Taken together, these studies indicate that the effect of LPS on hepatic RXR&#x003b1;-dependent gene expression is not due to reduced RXR&#x003b1; RNA levels or increased SHP&#x02013;rather it appears to be a consequence of post-translational modification and rapid LPS-induced subcellular re-distribution of RXR&#x003b1; protein. This is in agreement that SHP-1 is a FXR/RAR target gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of LPS on DNA binding activity of Type II nuclear receptor pairs in liver</title><p>In order to determine if reduced nuclear RXR&#x003b1; protein levels leads to impaired DNA binding activity of RXR&#x003b1; and its partners, electrophoretic mobility shift analyses were performed. Nuclear extracts were prepared from livers of saline or LPS-treated mice and incubated with oligonucleotides containing canonical DNA elements scanning Type II NR binding sites&#x02013;direct repeats of the hexad AGGTCA, separated by 1 to 5 nucleotides (DR1-5), or an inverted repeat separated by 1 nucleotide (IR1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. As Type II NRs, RXR&#x003b1; partners with either RAR&#x003b1;, PPAR&#x003b1;, PXR, CAR, LXR or FXR to bind to one or more of these sites (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]). At 16 h after LPS treatment, binding to all 6 RXR&#x003b1;-containing canonical sequences was significantly reduced in hepatic nuclear extracts from LPS-treated animals (~45&#x02013;70% reduction) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), consistent with a diminished nuclear RXR&#x003b1;.

We hypothesized that reduced nuclear levels of RXR&#x003b1; after LPS administration would be manifested by broad alterations in RXR&#x003b1;-dependent gene expression across diverse physiological processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Our results demonstrate that LPS signaling induces rapid and profound reduction of hepatic nuclear RXR&#x003b1; protein levels, concomitant with appearance of RXR&#x003b1; in the cytoplasm, leading to subsequent reduction in the expression of RXR&#x003b1;-dependent hepatic genes.</p><p>Recent studies have led to a broader understanding of the molecular basis for the role of LPS in intracellular signaling and hepatic function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Activation of monocytes/macrophages by LPS leads to the secretion of a number of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. LPS-induced activation of Kupffer cells, the resident hepatic macrophages, triggers several crucial intracellular signaling pathways in hepatocytes, including stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), JNK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Stress-activated protein kinases, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-4 (MKK4/SEK1) and its downstream mediator JNK was shown to directly phosphorylate RXR&#x003b1;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Previous studies by our group[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] demonstrated that inhibition of the JNK signaling pathway completely blocked IL-1&#x003b2;-mediated suppression of RXR&#x003b1;-dependent <italic>Ntcp </italic>gene expression, thus implicating JNK to be a central player in inflammation-induced cholestasis. Most evident in the 1 hour sample are high molecular weight forms of RXR&#x003b1;, consistent with covalent post-translational modification (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), although the actual nature of this high molecular weight species is currently unknown and under investigation. One plausible interpretation of these data is that LPS-induced activation of JNK leading to phosphorylation and likely further modification of RXR&#x003b1;, triggering its transport from nucleus to cytoplasm, where it may be targeted for degradation. Phosphorylation has been shown to be involved in the degradation of RXR&#x003b1; :RAR&#x003b1; heterodimers by proteasomes, thus providing a mechanism for JNK-mediated inhibition of RXR&#x003b1;-dependent target gene transactivation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] RNA levels of RXR&#x003b1; were not affected by LPS, further supporting nuclear export of RXR&#x003b1; as a primary mechanism of suppression of hepatic genes during negative hepatic APR.</p><p>The interrelationship and roles played by JNK and phospho-RXR&#x003b1; are neither readily nor definitively explored in an in vivo model, especially using such a broadly-acting inflammatory agent like LPS. Hepatocytes and liver-derived HepG2 cells in culture respond to LPS-induced cytokines like TNF&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; by suppressing the expression of negative hepatic APR genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Recent work in our laboratory indicates that treatment of HepG2 cells with IL-1&#x003b2; leads to RXR&#x003b1; nuclear export, dependent upon JNK-mediated phosphorylation of select residues in RXR&#x003b1; (Zimmerman <italic>et al</italic>., manuscript in preparation). In transfected cells, nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced phosphorylation of the orphan nuclear receptor NGFI-B (Nur77) resulted in the translocation of RXR-NGFI-B complex out of the nucleus, indicating that distribution of RXR in these cells was regulated by NGFI-B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The data presented here are the first to indicate that inflammation-mediated cell signaling leads to rapid subcellular redistribution of native RXR&#x003b1;, changing the previous impression of RXR&#x003b1; as a stable nuclear resident [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Finally, these findings indicate significant cross-talk between JNK-signaling and NR-mediated gene expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall, we conclude that RXR&#x003b1; is rapidly exported out of the nucleus in response to LPS. RXR&#x003b1;, as an obligate heterodimer with other class II NRs, regulates the expression of a broad array of genes involved in critical metabolic pathways in the liver, many of which are impaired during the negative hepatic APR. This helps explain how inflammation-induced signaling can lead to rapid, diverse and multiple alterations in hepatic gene expression, which has implications for future therapeutic targets of both acute and chronic liver diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>LPS (<italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>) was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.
