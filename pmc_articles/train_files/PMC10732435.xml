However, uncertainty in market and business decisions hinders the EDI diffusion process in China. Therefore, this research aims to solve the uncertainty problem of EDI diffusion by examining market demand and government policy coordination. First, we utilize complex network game theory and establish a technology&#x02013;organization&#x02013;environment framework for the factors that influence the elements of EDI transformation by combining evidence from existing studies. Second, the network game model is constructed to analyze and optimize the updating rules in the network as a diffusion strategy that enterprises under the uncertain market can adopt. Finally, the impact of adjusting government subsidies and different premiums on the diffusion of EDI transformation strategies is examined. The degree of market diffusion and average revenue of EDI are higher after the optimization of network node strategy updating rules compared to before optimization. Further analysis reveals that only the premium effect of product pricing and inverted U-shaped subsidy support from the government affect the degree of market diffusion and the average revenue of EDI, while the other premium effects are not significant. These findings enrich research related to complex networks and nonlinear dynamic strategies. They also indicate recommendations for government policies to enhance diffusion efficiency and reasonable pricing for enterprises to promote returns.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

DI plays a crucial role in achieving this objective. Currently, companies primarily use digital technologies to collect user information for product and service updates [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], resulting in data stock growth. However, the value of massive data has not been fully explored. According to data released by experts at the &#x0201c;Big Data and Artificial Intelligence&#x0201d; sub-forum of the 5th China Cloud Computing Conference, 99.6% of the data value in China remains untapped. Data captured by digital technology needs to be further explored for its value through the application of digital intelligence technology, thus, there is an urgent need to develop concepts other than digitization. DI is a &#x0201c;new concept&#x0201d; that combines digitalization and intellectualization to provide more accurate, innovative, and demand-driven products and services. It combines digital technologies such as blockchain, internet of things, and cloud computing with intelligent technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) to improve operational efficiency. For instance, Haier established the Khaos industrial Internet platform after promoting DI, which has enabled users&#x02019; full process participation, reduced inventory, improved efficiency, and facilitated the development of multiple subjects collaboratively [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Therefore, it can be inferred that DI, as the next phase of digitalization transformation, may emerge as a prominent trend.</p><p>However, there are fewer existing academic studies on DI, which mainly focus on education [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], library intelligence [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and supply chain [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] studies. Although these studies have recognized the significance of DI transformation, they tend to take a macro perspective, overlooking the crucial role of enterprises as micro actors. DI transformation should be seen as an enterprise behavior that can drive technological innovation, promote cooperation between industry, academia, and research, and foster a virtuous cycle of enterprise digitalization and intellectualization (EDI) transformation. However, existing research on EDI is limited: it mainly focuses on enterprise digitalization or intelligent transformation [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. To some extent, these studies provide a foundation for the study of enterprise digital or intelligent transformation but hinder our understanding of EDI behavior from a mixed perspective. Furthermore, scholars have considered combining digitalization and intelligence to study the transformation process of enterprises [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Existing research methods on technology transformation such as digitalization or intelligence have taken several different approaches. For enterprise digitalization or intelligence, Han et al. established a digital maturity model to evaluate the degree of digital transformation of consulting firms and showed that future digital transformation requires comprehensive integration of more specialized digital technologies [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although some scholars have adopted an econometric approach to study the impact of single (multiple) factors on technological transformation such as digitalization or intelligence of enterprises, such as R&#x00026;D [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], policy [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and resources [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], it does not view enterprise transformation as a systemic change. A game theory approach can further study the interactions between stakeholders and the impact of their own decisions on the diffusion of technological transformation, such as digitalization or intelligence. Wang et al. used a three-party game model to study the impact of heterogeneous governmental environmental regulations on the diffusion of green technology in the manufacturing industry from the perspective of supply and demand [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Zhou et al. established a non-cooperative game model to study ways to balance the competitive interests of customers and reduce the cost of manufacturing technology in the process of the transformation of shop-floor intelligence in an enterprise [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Yin et al. used a stochastic differential game model to consider the diffusion of low-carbon technology sharing in a collaborative innovation system between advantaged and disadvantaged firms considering internal and external influences [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>EDI can be viewed as a game evolution process among stakeholders in the market, such as enterprises, government, and the public. Xu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], Zhang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and Brunswicker et al. [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] examined the role of different actors in promoting DI and EDI. However, most researchers focus on the interactions of different subjects in the system and seldom consider the interactions of the same kind of units within different game subjects. Meanwhile, Yin et al. attempted to use complex networks to describe the sustained epidemic prevention effect of government collaboration under the Big Data Intelligence Innovation (BDII) mechanism [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], while Tan et al. further explored the evolution of the information sharing behavior of the network of firms within the supply chain by using the game methodology on the complex network, discussing the information synergistic effect of the firms in the supply chain and the strategies that can be adopted in the process of the diffusion of behavior [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition, most game models use static parameter mechanisms for simulation [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and these models may not be able to comprehensively capture dynamic changes in strategies during the evolution of the game [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Building on the preceding analysis shows that the model of a complex network game can be used to solve the problem of digital and intelligent transformation of enterprises. However, most existing research examines the transformation process of enterprise digitalization or intelligence separately, or conflates the two concepts, and few studies on digital and intelligent transformation exist. The research methods mostly use a single two- or three-party game form for digital or intelligent research, without considering that multiple enterprises are affected by the decisions of neighboring enterprises in the DI diffusion process. Moreover, the fixed parameters also allow participants access to only a static and single management mechanism. Therefore, this study aims to examine the factors influencing the transformation of EDI using a technology&#x02013;organization&#x02013;environment (TOE) framework of technology innovation diffusion. Specifically, the study develops a complex network game model of EDI transformation diffusion, and design static, linear dynamic, and non-linear dynamic subsidy and premium schemes. Simultaneously, we optimize the update rules, which can guide enterprise choosing strategies under the uncertain market(complex network), and analyze the effectiveness of three different subsidy and premium schemes, corresponding to static, dynamic linear, and dynamic inverted-U types, in combination with simulations.</p><p>Given that uncertainty in government and business decisions hinders EDI transformation, research on the evolutionary process of EDI diffusion and the strategies adopted by stakeholders in market environments is necessary. Therefore, this research aims to address the uncertainty of EDI diffusion by examining market demand and government policy coordination. Regarding the existing background, this study has the following significance: theoretically, this paper explores digital intelligence that is different from digitalization; establishes a complex network game model; optimizes the updating rules of the network game as a corporate strategy for EDI diffusion; further expands existing complex network game theory; enriches the application of TOE theory in the transformation of digital intelligence; and identifies the relevant technological, organizational, and environment-related influencing factors. At the same time, the advantages of nonlinear parameters in complex network diffusion are verified; practically, the updated diffusion rules provide a better strategy for enterprises to carry out DI diffusion. Furthermore, the setting of nonlinear parameters in the network game provides a management basis for government and enterprises in the process of DI transformation. The findings of the study can provide valuable insights into factors that drive EDI transformation.</p><p>The paper is structured as follows: The <italic toggle="yes">Literature review</italic> section describes and constructs the research framework of the diffusion of EDI transformation based on TOE theory.

As DI is a form of technology integration diffusion, it shares similarities with the diffusion of other technologies. Research on technology diffusion is extensive; Guo et al. employed the Lotka-Volterra model to examine the diffusion of building information modeling (BIM) technology operation and maintenance, and identified three diffusion results: full market share, partial market share, and exit from the market [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Similarly, Benhabib et al. investigated how endogenous innovation and technology diffusion interact to shape productivity distribution and generate aggregate growth. They discovered that expensive technological inputs create a gap between the best and worst technologies used to produce similar goods, and that the aggregate growth rate equals the innovator&#x02019;s maximum growth rate in the equilibrium growth path [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. While the diffusion results of EDI transformation are likely to share some characteristics with technology diffusion, DI transformation integrates and applies DI technologies. Therefore, diffusion of DI technology should be distinguished from diffusion of a single technology. This requires considering not only the combined cost of different technology applications but also the important roles of government and the public in promoting the DI process. Moreover, companies in the market are influenced by themselves as well as by the mutual influence of different companies in the same market.</p><p>The study of games in complex networks began with the prisoner&#x02019;s dilemma game in the rule network, which compared individual and neighbor gains and adjusted game strategy by imitating the optimal rule. The research found that cooperative participants could counteract the betrayal strategy by aggregating on the rule grid [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Since then, new developments in games in complex networks have emerged. Chen et al. investigated prisoner&#x02019;s dilemma games in scale-free community networks and found that a more pronounced community structure leads to higher levels of group cooperation [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Liu et al. addressed the problem of individual diversity and independent networks in the evolution of cooperative behavior, transforming the game model into an interdependent network by hybrid coupling (i.e., of utility and probability). They classified players&#x02019; strategic behavior types into a layer related to individual diversity and found a hybrid coupling optimal region between networks that can promote cooperation [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Studies have also examined innovation diffusion in the market for a particular technology or product based on a complex network game. Wang et al. explored the competition mechanism between firms and neighboring networks in the industry using a complex network evolutionary game model [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Zhao et al. modeled diffusion of new energy vehicles based on different networks and found that macro-level government subsidy rates can promote the diffusion of new energy vehicles, while large networks are more sensitive to subsidies than small networks [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, combining complex networks with analysis of EDI transformation in the market can more clearly identify the relevant mechanisms in the diffusion process.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>An EDI transformation framework</title><p>The term &#x0201c;digital intelligence&#x0201d; was initially introduced by the &#x0201c;Knowledge-Based Consortium&#x0201d; at Peking University, which defined it as a combination of digital intelligence and intelligent digitalization. Scholars have defined DI as the integration of digital and intelligent technology [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. As a crucial aspect of China&#x02019;s DI transformation, the DI transformation of enterprises can be defined as the interactive application of DI technologies to enhance the profitability and efficiency of enterprises. This can also be considered as the proliferation of multiple technology combinations in various enterprises within the market [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Extensive research has investigated technology diffusion, and found that TOE theory is a well-established framework that explains the emergence and development of new technologies in the market. The TOE framework was proposed by Nazky and Fleischer in 1990 as a comprehensive tool for analyzing the impact of factors such as technology, organization, and environment on new technology adoption. The framework&#x02019;s strengths are its strong systematicity, flexibility, and operability. As the framework does not specify explanatory variables for the three types of factors, it remains widely applicable in various research scenarios and purposes. Hence, the TOE framework has become an indispensable analytical tool in scientific research for studying the factors influencing new technology adoption [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. TOE theory has been widely used in the study of supply chains [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], BIM technology applications [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and innovation patent development [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Based on the above research, the market diffusion path of EDI transformation needs to be considered from three levels. First, at the technical level, technology R&#x00026;D investment will enhance the degree of specialization of enterprises for the application of DI technology [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Simultaneously, the research and development of new technologies will also enable the enterprise to enhance the corresponding knowledge base, and accumulate knowledge of DI transformation [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The technology premium effect has a positive impact on the economic consequences of product returns, production, and operational efficiency [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and the economic foundation determines the superstructure, which can increase investment in the research and development of digital intelligence technology and the introduction of relevant talent with the support of a sufficient economy. Second, at the organizational level, human resources play a crucial role in promoting EDI transformation. Human resources are an important cost for enterprises, which can not only promote the transformation of knowledge results generated by R&#x00026;D investment, but may also reduce labor costs via the introduction of DI technology [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Third, at the environmental level, enterprises are not only in a competitive relationship with similar firms but also affected by heterogeneous consumers in the marketplace and government policies. Consumers&#x02019; consumption concepts advance the important driving force of EDI transformation [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], which can source operating funds as well as enhance the enterprise&#x02019;s reputation and promote the sustainable development of the enterprise. Simultaneously, only by adhering to government policies can we better seize opportunities in the international environment, realize the social value of enterprises, and meet the needs of national economic development [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].

The specific research factors include R&#x00026;D investment (R&#x00026;D) and technology premiums (digital technology and IT support) at the technical level, employee costs (human capital), and production and operation level (financial resources and business level) at the organizational level, and enterprise competition and cooperation (sectorial relevance), consumer preference (consumer preference), and government policy (government support) at the environmental level. Interaction among these factors can further enhance the DI level of the enterprise. Technological progress has resulted in automatic accumulation and precipitation of data flow, which not only improves the technical level but also enhances the management efficiency of the organization and the position of enterprises in the industry environment. Contrarily, organizational transformation can stimulate technological innovation and strengthen collaborative ability with other enterprises. Interactions at the environmental level can improve the efficiency of the entire society and promote further transformation of enterprise technology and organizational management, laying a solid foundation for EDI transformation. The government&#x02019;s policy support services also play a vital role in this transformation. Thus, the TOE framework can provide a theoretical basis for constructing and verifying the complex network game model for the transformation of EDI under different scenarios of subsidy and premium schemes, as shown in <xref rid="pone.0295327.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0295327.g001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0295327.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>TOE framework for the transformation conditions of EDI.</title><p><italic toggle="yes">Note</italic>: R&#x00026;D, research and development; EDI, enterprise digitalization and intellectualization; DIE, digital and intellectual enterprise.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0295327.g001" position="float"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Research hypotheses</title><p>In a perfectly competitive market, firms aim to maximize profits by selecting a production technology that aligns with consumer preferences and generates demand for their product. With the advent of the digital era, digital and intellectual enterprise has emerged as a leading market force with significant potential for growth and revenue. Within a DI diffusion network, firms continually update their connections and engage in imitation behavior, resulting in a homogeneous group effect that follows a power-law distribution of connected nodes. This network characteristic is indicative of a small-world network structure [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Based on the aforementioned market dynamics, we make the following assumptions.</p><p><bold>Hypothesis 1:</bold> In a market comprising <bold><italic toggle="yes">N</italic></bold> firms, proportion <bold><italic toggle="yes">x</italic></bold> chooses to undergo a transformation in the DI sector, while the remaining 1-<bold><italic toggle="yes">x</italic></bold> do not. In a scale-free network, firms initially make one of these two decisions based on market diffusion. When an enterprise opts not to undergo DI transformation, it adopts traditional digital means to generate product income (<bold><italic toggle="yes">R</italic></bold><sub><bold><italic toggle="yes">a</italic></bold></sub>), other income (such as production and operation efficiency improvement) (<bold><italic toggle="yes">P</italic></bold><sub><bold><italic toggle="yes">a</italic></bold></sub>), and labor costs (<bold><italic toggle="yes">C</italic></bold><sub><bold><italic toggle="yes">a</italic></bold></sub>). In contrast, if the enterprise chooses to promote DI transformation, it must first invest in talent, technology, equipment, and related areas (<bold><italic toggle="yes">I</italic></bold>). Owing to the adoption of advanced DI means, the enterprise&#x02019;s product income increases to <bold><italic toggle="yes">R</italic></bold><sub><bold><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></bold></sub>, while other income becomes <bold><italic toggle="yes">P</italic></bold><sub><bold><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></bold></sub>, and labor cost becomes <bold><italic toggle="yes">C</italic></bold><sub><bold><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></bold></sub>. The premium effect of DI transformation on product revenue, other revenue, and labor cost is determined by premium factors (&#x003b1;1, &#x003b1;2, &#x003b1;3). Studies suggest that the relationship between these factors is such that <bold><italic toggle="yes">R</italic></bold><sub><bold><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></bold></sub> = <bold><italic toggle="yes">R</italic></bold><sub><bold><italic toggle="yes">a</italic></bold></sub>(1+<bold><italic toggle="yes">&#x003b1;</italic></bold><sub><bold><italic toggle="yes">1</italic></bold></sub>), <bold><italic toggle="yes">P</italic></bold><sub><bold><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></bold></sub> = <bold><italic toggle="yes">P</italic></bold><sub><bold><italic toggle="yes">a</italic></bold></sub>(1+<bold><italic toggle="yes">&#x003b1;</italic></bold><sub><bold><italic toggle="yes">2</italic></bold></sub>), and <bold><italic toggle="yes">C</italic></bold><sub><bold><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></bold></sub> = <bold><italic toggle="yes">C</italic></bold><sub><bold><italic toggle="yes">a</italic></bold></sub>(1-<bold><italic toggle="yes">&#x003b1;</italic></bold><sub><bold><italic toggle="yes">3</italic></bold></sub>).</p><p><bold>Hypothesis 2:</bold> The proportion of consumers with more DI product preferences is <bold><italic toggle="yes">&#x003b2;</italic></bold>, and those with traditional product preferences is 1-<bold><italic toggle="yes">&#x003b2;</italic></bold>. Consumer preference theory posits that consumer behavior is determined by their preferences. When facing the choice between traditional and DI products in the market, the profits generated by different enterprise strategies can vary depending on consumers&#x02019; preferences. For instance, in the preliminary stages of the launch of new energy vehicles, owing to immature technology, most consumers preferred traditional products, and traditional vehicles remained the main source of sales profits for enterprises. However, with the continuous development of DI technologies, such as intelligent driving, planning, key element perception, and energy saving, automobile consumers&#x02019; preferences have shifted toward DI products. These consumers are willing to pay higher prices for products with more DI characteristics. This shift has resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of sales profits from new energy vehicles in enterprises, which has further incentivized the automobile industry to prefer the production of DI products. When firms cater to consumers with DI product preferences: (1) If both the firm and its neighbors promote DI transformation, the unit product revenue is <bold><italic toggle="yes">f</italic></bold><sub><bold><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></bold></sub>, and the firm satisfies the average market demand <bold><italic toggle="yes">q</italic></bold>, resulting in product revenue <bold><italic toggle="yes">R</italic></bold><sub><bold><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></bold></sub> = <bold><italic toggle="yes">f</italic></bold><sub><bold><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></bold></sub>

Among them, the constructed network structure can reflect the distribution of different strategies of homogeneous enterprises in the market over time; the game model can determine the situation in which all firms in the network keep changing with the strategy changes of neighboring firms at each point in time; and the network evolution rule can determine the decision criteria of whether firms change according to the strategies of their neighbors. Thus, the study discusses the construction process of the model stepwise.</p><sec id="sec007"><title>Network game model under stochastic rules</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Network structure</title><p>Research has demonstrated that small-world networks are a valuable tool for analyzing social networks that can be classified into two main types: NW small-world networks and WS small-world networks.

Conversely, the broken edge reconnection of WS small-world networks provides a more accurate representation of the changing nature of mutual influence among enterprises. In this study, the coupling of EDI technology innovation strategies on a small-world network is simulated and analyzed, using the WS small-world network algorithm [<xref rid="pone.0295327.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>].

However, the random comparison of the return choices leads to greater return risk and uncertainty, and does not consider that each firm not only pursues the highest return strategy but also selects a less risky strategy. To optimize this strategy, we introduce the Savage regret value criterion in the following sections.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Updating rule under the Savage criterion</title><p>Considering the fact that enterprises under the uncertain markets not only pursue maximum returns but also aim to reduce risks, this study introduces the Savage criterion to propose risk-averse evolutionary rules to optimize the existing network evolutionary criterion. In 1951, statistician Savage proposed the Savage criterion, also known as the minimax regret value criterion. This criterion is an essential tool in management and describes an approach taken by decision-makers to avoid greater opportunity losses in a state of nature without knowledge. The primary function of this criterion is to construct a regret value matrix, where each outcome entry represents a regret value defined as the difference between the best possible outcome and the given outcome. Subsequently, the matrix is used for risky decisions, whereby the expected regret values of other options are compared, and the smallest is selected as the factor determining the quality of the decision. The option corresponding to this value is the chosen option. The solution selected under this criterion allows for less risk while ensuring a larger benefit for the decision-maker.</p><p>The update rule employs the Savage criterion. First, the strategy chosen by each node in the next period at <bold><italic toggle="yes">t</italic></bold><sub><bold><italic toggle="yes">0</italic></bold></sub> is selected based on the strategy of that node and the surrounding nodes in moment <bold><italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-1</bold> to select the strategy in moment <bold><italic toggle="yes">t</italic></bold>. Then, the Savage criterion is used for all the two possible strategies of the nodes at moment <bold><italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-1</bold> to decide the specific strategy at moment <bold><italic toggle="yes">t</italic></bold>. The steps involved are as follows:</p><p><bold>Step 1:</bold> For any node in the network, represented by <bold><italic toggle="yes">w</italic></bold><sub><bold><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></bold></sub>, with an associated node <bold><italic toggle="yes">w</italic></bold><sub><bold><italic toggle="yes">j</italic></bold></sub>, the node has two strategies, <bold><italic toggle="yes">D</italic></bold><sub><bold><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></bold></sub> and <bold><italic toggle="yes">D</italic></bold><sub><bold><italic toggle="yes">a</italic></bold></sub>.

If the difference between the total return of the current strategy and that of the opposite strategy is greater, the strategy remains unchanged.

This study not only provides a different perspective from the existing literature for analyzing the diffusion of EDI transformation but also provides ideas on ways to formulate decision-making behaviors related to government subsidies and enterprise pricing under environmental regulation. To promote the transformation of EDI and realize China&#x02019;s vision of socialist modernization, the following suggestions are proposed based on this study and existing empirical evidence. (1) Adjust the government subsidy program. The government should implement dynamic subsidy policies according to the market situation and establish special support programs for EDI transformation. This will enhance the initiative and enthusiasm for EDI transformation. Financial institutions should also increase their support for EDI transformation and guide enterprises to invest in DI technology. The government can use various types of publicity media to convey the premium effect of DI to enterprises, changing the co-competition relationship between enterprises in the market and promoting the transformation of EDI from the &#x0201c;demand side.&#x0201d; (2) Improve enterprise technology premiums and reasonable pricing of products. Enterprises should combine DI with basic technology innovation, promote artificial intelligence and key technology breakthroughs, enhance data analysis capabilities, and improve manufacturing facilities and manpower to achieve accurate and dynamic adjustment of operational efficiency. By combining market share, product advantages, and consumer preferences, enterprises can make reasonable pricing for DI products, improve market competitiveness, and promote the transformation of DI. (3) Enhance consumers&#x02019; awareness of DI. Enterprises must create more experience opportunities for consumers to interact with DI products, develop new customers and discover potential customers, and absorb a large number of potential users to form continuous and stable consumers of DI products. Enterprises should also find the appropriate number of neighboring enterprises for DI cooperation, systematically create an internal communication platform to enhance data exchangeability among enterprises, give full play to the industrial cluster effect, and accelerate the DI transformation process of enterprises adopting DI strategy in the market while improving their income.</p><p>This study has certain limitations. The selection of the sub parameters in the TOE framework has some limitations and can be further combined with questionnaires or case studies, which can enhance the richness of the framework. Meanwhile, since the research only exists in the game at the enterprise level, multi-layer complex networks can be added for analysis in the future. Furthermore, this study does not carry out empirical research based on the factors influencing transformation, and this can be addressed in future research using questionnaire data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec024" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0295327.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><p>(ZIP)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0295327.s001.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0295327.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>JX</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Anuo</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>SS</given-names></name>. <article-title>Data Protection of Internet Enterprise Platforms in the Era of Big Data.</article-title>

</p><p>Reviewer #1</p><p>Q1: The topic of this manuscript is very interesting, but many key factors are not taken into account in the paper. I do not agree with the research framework of Figure1 in the manuscript. Why is the technical aspect employee cost and business level? Why not consider digital technology versus existing technology? Why on the organizational side is R&#x00026;D investment and technology premium?</p><p>Answer: We feel great thanks for your professional review work on our article.</p><p>First, we were really sorry for our careless mistakes. In Figure 1, the technical and organizational factors are placed upside down. In that research framework of fig. 1, the correct writing should be that the technical aspect includes R&#x00026;D investment and technology premium, and the organizational aspect includes staff cost and business level. The correct picture has been updated in line 193 of the manuscript.</p><p>According to your nice suggestions, we sorted out some research related to the influencing factors of digital transformation. We classify these influencing factors according to the TOE framework. The classification results are shown in Table 1. (The table has been added to the text of the manuscript)</p><p>As can be seen from Table 1, the technical aspects mainly include digital technology, AI technology and R&#x00026;D. In our manuscript, with reference to Ancillo and Gavrila (2023) and Zapata et al. (2021), the first factor in technology selection is R&#x00026;D investment. The second factor is the technology premium. Digital technology and artificial intelligence technology, these two words are widely used. Traditional technology mainly uses computers, networks and other hard equipment software to innovate, and its application scope has certain limitations. Digital technology is the general name of artificial intelligence, big data, block chain and other scientific technologies. Compared with traditional technologies, digital technology is more intelligent. The leading enterprise's digital intelligence transformation provides a demonstration for the enterprises in the digital intelligence transformation stage, and the enterprises in the digital intelligence transformation stage will learn from and learn from new digital technologies and business models to improve their production and operation efficiency. This process is summarized as technology premium. Technology premium, the word describes the technical advantages of digital technology itself and the influence of digital technology on traditional technology.</p><p>The Organization aspects mainly include financial resources, business level and human capital. In our manuscript, we choose staff cost as one of the organizational factors. Because staff cost can not only reflect human capital, but also reflect the characteristics of financial resources. Another factor, referring to the research of Benlian and Haffke (2016), Hansen et al (2011), Singh and Hess (2017), Jackson and Dunn-Jensen (2021), chooses business level.</p><p>Reviewer #2</p><p>This paper mainly investigates how to promote the process of EDI by complex network game theory and TOE framework. This is a hot topic problem nowadays. However, it&#x02019;s a pity that the literature contribution of this version manuscript is relatively marginal. Some detailed advice is listed as follows. </p><p>Q1: You analyze the three levels of TOE technology, organization, and environment, and derive the payoff matrix providing a theoretical basis for the game model. However, the relationship between them seems very ambiguous. </p><p>Q2: In line 175, what&#x02019;s the meaning of other income (such as production and operation efficiency improvement)? </p><p>Q3: EDI is an accumulation process in reality. The complex network game in this paper now can&#x02019;t reflect the feature. Meanwhile, Hypothesis 2 seems not correspond to the fact of reality. As such, some analysis based on real situations should be given. </p><p>Q4: Some notations haven&#x02019;t been explained clearly. Such as the equation in line 263. Hence, you&#x02019;d better give a notation table to make them. Meanwhile, some terms are not explained clearly, e.g., &#x02018;premium effect&#x02019;. </p><p>Q5: Typos in Table 1. It is &#x02018;Not Adopt&#x02019; instead of &#x02018;Adopt&#x02019;.</p><p>We feel great thanks for your professional review work on our article.</p><p>According to your nice suggestions, we further clarify the contribution of this article. Firstly, it focuses on the micro subjects of Digitalization and Intellectualization Enterprises (DIE), deriving the conditional logic of EDI transformation based on the TOE framework of technological innovation diffusion. This research is a useful attempt to apply the toe framework to the transformation of enterprise digital intelligence, which broadens the application boundary of the toe framework. Secondly, the study addresses the limitations of the Fermi update rule in different game situations of the complex network of EDI. By combining the savage criterion to design a renewal strategy, the study aims to improve the enterprise returns based on risk reduction. This research provides decision-making basis for enterprises to improve product pricing. Finally, the study introduces an inverted U-shaped subsidy function and a dynamic subsidy to the traditional evolutionary game model to compare the advantages of different government subsidy strategies. This approach provides a new reference for the government to promote DI reform in China. We added this part to lines 64~74.</p><p>Answer 1: Thank you very much for your question. We realize that in the manuscript, we focus on the single aspect of technology, organization and environment, but the relationship among them is vague.</p><p>Technology is the foundation of EDI. Enterprises that implement EDI form technological advantages by increasing R&#x00026;D investment, and provide consumers with alternative and innovative product choices. The spillover of digital technology has had a demonstration effect on enterprises that implement traditional technology.</p><p>Organization is the main body of EDI. Staff resources and financial resources are both important factors in an organization, and staff cost takes both into account. The integration of digital technology into existing organizations requires employees who are proficient in digital technology, and the participation of digital labor force will bring about the improvement of management level.</p><p>The relationship between the three can be summarized as such a passage. Policies in the environment will guide the technological and organizational progress of enterprises. The competitive relationship in the environment will force enterprises that implement traditional technologies to improve their technical level and improve their organizational structure. The cooperative relationship in the environment can stimulate the positive effect of technology spillover and accelerate the progress of the organization. Technological progress is guided by policies in environmental factors and stimulates the industry environment to form a learning effect. The progress of the organization has created a peer effect for the industry environment.</p><p>We added this part to lines 182~189. And we integrate the relationship between the three into the research framework of Fig 1, which has been further improved.</p><p>Answer 2: In line 175, the specific meaning of other income in the manuscript refers to all economic income except the income from main business. These benefits are formed through daily activities such as selling goods, providing labor income and transferring the right to use assets. These benefits have the characteristics of low frequency, small amount of each business and low proportion of income. In addition, we accurately define the product income mentioned in the manuscript as the main business income (mainly through products) that enterprises can obtain by adopting traditional digital means. It has been supplemented in the description of important parameters in Table 2.</p><p>Answer 3: EDI is an accumulation process in reality. The income of complex network proposed in this paper is the income of all enterprises in the whole network. In the process of network game, it gradually realizes stable growth, which reflects that EDI achieves stable income in the process of continuous accumulation. Take the dynamic subsidy as an example. As shown in Figure 8a, under the dynamic subsidy, the proportion of EDI is 30%, and after the dynamic subsidy adjustment, the proportion of EDI has accumulated to 70%. At the same time, as shown in figure 8b, corporate income is also growing.</p><p>In Hypothesis 2, we use the specific case of new energy vehicles to further elaborate the hypothetical content. According to the theory of consumer preference, consumer behavior is determined by their preferences. When facing the choice between traditional and digital intelligent products in the market, the profits generated by different enterprise strategies can vary depending on consumers' preferences. For instance, in the early days of the launch of new energy vehicles, due to immature technology, most consumers still preferred traditional products, and traditional vehicles remained the main source of sales profits for enterprises. However, with the continuous development of digital and intelligent technologies, such as intelligent driving, planning, key element perception, and energy saving, automobile consumers' preferences have shifted towards digital intelligence. These consumers are willing to pay higher prices for products with more digital intelligence characteristics. This shift has resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of sales profits from new energy vehicles in enterprises, which has further incentivized the automobile industry to prefer the production of digital intelligent products. We added this part to lines 240~255.</p><p>Answer 4: Important parameter Table 2 has been added to the manuscript. Compared with traditional technologies, digital technology is more intelligent. The leading enterprise's digital intelligence transformation provides a demonstration for the enterprises in the digital intelligence transformation stage, and the enterprises in the digital intelligence transformation stage will learn from and learn from new digital technologies and business models to improve their production and operation efficiency. This process is summarized as technology premium. For the premium effect, &#x003b1;1 is the premium factor of the product income of the digital intelligent transformation and upgrading enterprise (referring to the fact that the production of digital intelligent products can improve the corresponding product income in the process of digital intelligent transformation). &#x003b1;2 is the premium factor for other benefits of enterprises in digital intelligent transformation and upgrading (it means that other benefits can be improved by adopting digital intelligent technology and management means in the process of digital intelligent transformation). &#x003b1;3 is the premium factor for the labor cost of enterprises in the process of digital intelligence transformation and upgrading (it means that adopting digital intelligence technology and management means can reduce the corresponding labor cost in the process of digital intelligence transformation).</p><p>Answer 5: Thanks for your careful checks. We are sorry for our carelessness. Based on your comments, we modified the word &#x02018;Not Adopt&#x02019; in Table 1 and checked the whole manuscript.</p><supplementary-material id="pone.0295327.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0295327.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0295327.r003" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0295327.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Morea</surname><given-names>Donato</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2023 Donato Morea</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2023</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Donato Morea</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0295327" id="rel-obj003" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>

<named-content content-type="author-response-date">16 Nov 2023</named-content>
</p><p>We sincerely thank the editor and all reviewers for their valuable feedback that we have used to improve the quality of our manuscript. At the same time, we revised the article according to the format requirements and template of your journal, and added corresponding attachments and public data links for data, codes and pictures as required. The reviewer comments are laid out below in italicized font and specific concerns have been numbered. In addition, relevant literature for which the reviewers provided references was cited in the suitable place. Our response is given in normal font and changes/additions to the manuscript are given in revision mode. At the end of the reply letter, the article needs to add financial support, the specific content is given in the reply, and the relevant content is also added in the cover letter.</p><p>Reviewer #1: </p><p>The reviewer believes that the topic &#x0201c;Diffusion and Evolution of Enterprise Digitalization and Intelligentization (EDI) Transformation and Upgrading: A TOE Framework-based Analysis&#x0201d; is worthy of investigation. However, the following needs to be addressed. There are minor and major issues that should be corrected. I believe the paper could be further strengthened by added information about.</p><p>Q1: What is the purpose of the paper? What are the research implications?</p><p>Answer: We thank the reviewers for your comments, according to which the enterprise digitalization and intelligence (EDI) studied in the article is an important aspect of China's modernization process. &#x0201c;Given that uncertainty in government and business decisions hinders EDI transformation, research on the evolutionary process of EDI diffusion and the strategies adopted by stakeholders in market environments is necessary. Therefore, &#x02026; The findings of the study can provide valuable insights into factors that drive EDI transformation&#x0201d;. The paragraph has been added to the introduction.</p><p>Q2: Please reorganize the manuscript at the journal request. Please change the reference format.</p><p>Answer: Thanks to the reviewer's comments, the article has been reformatted to follow the journal format and the appendix images, data, and code files have been updated.</p><p>Q3: The language of this manuscript is very bad and needs help from native speakers.</p><p>Answer: We thank the reviewers for your comments, based on which we sought the help of native speakers and revised the language of the article, as shown in the marked section of the revised paper with proof of touch-ups.</p><p>Q4: The title of the manuscript should fully demonstrate the content of this study and the relevant subjects.</p><p>Answer: We thank the reviewers for your comments, and based on the review comments, the title has been revised to take into account the content and topic of the study: Network evolution of diffusion in enterprise digitalization and intellectualization transformation: A technology&#x02013;organization&#x02013;environment framework perspective.</p><p>Q5: Abstracts should include the purpose and findings of the study. Please simplify the presentation of the study process.</p><p>Answer: Thanks to the reviewer's comments, according to the reviewer's comments, we revised and added the purpose and significance of the study to the abstract of the article. At the same time, we have simplified the description of the research process by revising the abstract to read &#x0201c;Enterprise digitalization and intellectualization (EDI) is a crucial aspect of China&#x02019;s modernization process. However, uncertainty in market and business decisions hinders the EDI diffusion process in China &#x02026; They also indicate recommendations for government policies to enhance diffusion efficiency and reasonable pricing for enterprises to promote returns&#x0201d;. For specific changes, please see the markup in the abstract section of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Q6: According to data released....................... This a very vague statement. These sentences do not provide any information on how the concept could be conceptualized?</p><p>Answer&#x0ff1a;Thanks to the reviewer's comments, according to the reviewer's comments, the data at this place in order to lead to the importance of the subsequent concept of digital intelligence, so the following modification has been added after the paragraph as a supplement &#x0201c;Data captured by digital technology needs to be further explored for its value through the application of digital intelligence technology, thus, there is an urgent need to develop concepts other than digitization.&#x0201d; For specific changes, please see the paragraph markers in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Q7: Building on the preceding analysis.................... This section should explain the study's context and research objective. Furthermore, the research gap needs to be narrowed after analyzing the previous studies. The research method is not adequately explained in the first section.</p><p>Answer&#x0ff1a;Thanks to the reviewer's comments, according to the reviewer's comments, we added the related research on digital intelligence in the introduction part, and further added the research on the gaming methods related to the EDI transformation and its shortcomings in that part. Meanwhile, in the first part, we add a description of the relevant research methods and propose some methodological gaps in the research. On this basis, we briefly explain the background and purpose of the study in this paragraph. Specific changes are marked in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Q8: Here author must build research gap following the previous studies. -The manuscript does not answer the following concerns: Why is it timeliness to explore such a study? What makes this study different from the previously published studies? Are there any similarly findings in line with the previously published studies? Are the findings different from prior academic studies that were conducted elsewhere, if any? What are the new technologies, some recent issue highlights the importance. See: An adoption-implementation framework of digital green knowledge to improve the performance of digital green innovation practices for industry 5.0. <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.132608" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.132608</ext-link></p><p>Answer: Thanks to the reviewer's comments, according to the reviewer's comments and with reference to related studies, the relevant content in the article has been enriched based on the following considerations: the article is considered to address is to further propose the concept of digitization, and at the same time to study the impacts of different corporate decisions in the market during the process of digital and intelligent transformation of enterprises. The study has similarities with existing studies, i.e., both consider changes in enterprise transformation under digital or intelligent technologies, but the difference is that the existing studies only unilaterally consider digital or smart transformation, with fewer references to the new concept and technology of DI. Meanwhile, for the application of the method, most of the articles adopt the method of two-party or multi-party evolutionary game, without considering the results of the game after the formation of complex networks by different enterprises. The main parts that need to be revised have been mentioned in the introduction, and of course, the relevant parts of other parts of the article have been revised, such as the abstract and the conclusion, and the specific changes are marked in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Q9: There is no flow in the text. It partly depends on the lack of proofreading but also on the fact that many statements and claims are made without being followed up by a clear and logical discussion. It is especially problematic in the Introduction that brings up a number of findings from different areas without linking them together.</p><p>Answer: Thanks to the reviewer's comments, according to the reviewer's comments, the article organized the logic of the introduction part, according to the logic of "research background - digitalization or intelligence research - DI research - EDI transformation research - research deficiencies - existing research methods - research deficiencies - research objectives - research significance" modified the introduction and added part of the literature enriched the relevant content. At the same time, each part is organized according to the depth of the literature research content, and the specific changes are marked in the introduction of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Q10: More importantly, the choice of the questionnaire questions should be explained in light of the theory and the prior literature on the topic. The arguments are simply relationships and causes very close to the replication of many studies dealing with the same thing. For example, what is connection of upgrading path of manufacturing enterprises from the value perspective. See the following: The governance mechanism of the building material industry (BMI) in transformation to green BMI: The perspective of green building. <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.04.317" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.04.317</ext-link></p><p>Answer: Thanks to the reviewer's comments, according to the reviewer's comments and with reference to related studies, we have made the following considerations: &#x0201c;First, at the technical level, technology R&#x00026;D investment will enhance the degree of specialization of enterprises for the application of DI technology. Simultaneously, the research and development of new technologies will also enable the enterprise to enhance the corresponding knowledge base, and accumulate knowledge of DI transformation. The technology premium effect has a positive impact on the economic consequences of product returns, production, and operational efficiency, and the economic foundation determines the superstructure, which can increase investment in the research and development of digital intelligence technology and the introduction of relevant talent with the support of a sufficient economy. Second, at the organizational level, human resources play a crucial role in promoting EDI transformation. Human resources are an important cost for enterprises, which can not only promote the transformation of knowledge results generated by R&#x00026;D investment, but may also reduce labor costs via the introduction of DI technology. Third, at the environmental level, enterprises are not only in a competitive relationship with similar firms but also affected by heterogeneous consumers in the marketplace and government policies. Consumers&#x02019; consumption concepts advance the important driving force of EDI transformation, which can source operating funds as well as enhance the enterprise&#x02019;s reputation and promote the sustainable development of the enterprise. Simultaneously, only by adhering to government policies can we better seize opportunities in the international environment, realize the social value of enterprises, and meet the needs of national economic development&#x0201d;. The paragraph has been added to the second subsection of Part 2 with relevant references, as indicated in the revised manuscript marker.</p><p>Q11: Methodology: Model. I suggest authors here build your main heading on Research and data methodology. Clearly explain the model building process, and what previous studies have used similar models (model testing approach).</p><p>See the following: A three-player game model for promoting the diffusion of green technology in manufacturing enterprises from the perspective of supply and demand.<ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3390/math8091585" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.3390/math8091585</ext-link></p><p>A stochastic differential game of low carbon technology sharing in collaborative innovation system of superior enterprises and inferior enterprises under uncertain environment, <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1515/math-2018-0056" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1515/math-2018-0056</ext-link></p><p>Information fusion for future COVID-19 prevention: continuous mechanism of big data intelligent innovation for the emergency management of a public epidemic outbreak.</p><p>Answer: Thanks to the reviewer's comments, according to the reviewer's comments and with reference to related studies, we have revised the title of the fourth and fifth parts of the article in conjunction with the content of the study, and added the process of modeling and the related study of applying the model at the beginning of the fourth part. The specific modifications are shown in the markup of the fourth and fifth parts of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Q12: Please consider this structure for manuscript final part. -Discussion-Conclusion-Managerial Implication-Practical/Social Implications</p><p>Answer&#x0ff1a;Thanks to the reviewer's comments, we have reorganized the article according to the structure suggested by the reviewers, specific textual changes are reflected in the markup of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Q13: Please make sure your conclusions' section underscores the scientific value-added of your paper, and/or the applicability of your findings/results. Highlight the novelty of your study. In addition to summarizing the actions taken and results, please strengthen the explanation of their significance. It is recommended to use quantitative reasoning comparing with appropriate benchmarks, especially those stemming from previous work.</p><p>Answer&#x0ff1a;Thanks to the reviewer's comments, according to the reviewer's comments, we further emphasize the scientific value and novelty at the beginning of the conclusion. Meanwhile, in the new dicussion section, we take government subsidies and corporate pricing as a point of discussion to explore their further value in the light of previous studies, and the specific textual changes can be found in the markups in Part 5 and 6 of the revised manuscript.</p><p>The article needs additional financial support as follows: Specific grant numbers: Project of Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of the Ministry of Education (Specific grant numbers: 18XJAZH004); Initials of authors who received each award: H H; Full names of commercial companies that funded the study or authors: Ministry of Education of China; Initials of authors who received salary or other funding from commercial companies: W Z; URLs to sponsors&#x02019; websites: <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.sinoss.net/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.sinoss.net/</ext-link>.
