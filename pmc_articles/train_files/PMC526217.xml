These viruses are exogenous to their host species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], have similar genomic organizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], integrate into dispersed sites within the host genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and appear transcriptionally silent in vivo (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]). However, BLV is unique in the HTLV family of retroviruses because it infects and dysregulates B lymphocytes instead of T cells. The natural host for BLV is cattle but the virus can also be experimentally transmitted to sheep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The pathogeneses in these species are globally similar despite higher frequencies of leukemogenesis in sheep (up to 100%) and shorter latency periods (1&#x02013;4 years versus 4&#x02013;10 in cattle) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Following BLV infection, the hosts, either cattle or sheep, develop a persistent antibody response to viral proteins and virions can be isolated from ex vivo cultured leucocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Detection of antibodies in the infected animals correlates with a transient B cell lymphocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In most cases, BLV infection remains clinically silent, a stage referred to as the asymptomatic or aleukemic stage of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Only 30% of BLV-infected cattle develop persistent lymphocytosis (PL), a polyclonal expansion of B cells coexpressing high levels of surface IgM, myeloid (CD11b) or T-specific (CD5) markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and less than 5% will die from a fatal leukemia, lymphoma or lymphosarcoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>A major advantage of the BLV system is the possibility to study viral genetic determinants in relation with infectivity and pathogenicity in vivo. A strategy, which we previously described, is based on the use of a cloned BLV provirus whose sequence can be mutagenized in vitro. Well characterized mutants can subsequently be injected into sheep and compared to the wild type virus (WT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This experimental protocol permitted the correlation of viral determinants with defined phenotypes in vivo. In particular, we showed that:</p><p>(i) the R3 and G4 accessory genes are required for efficient viral spread in vivo, although their deletion or mutation does not hamper infectivity (mutants CRX3 and IG4 described by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]).</p><p>(ii) restoring a CRE consensus (cyclic-AMP response element; TGACGTCA) in the triplicate motif of the imperfectly conserved Tax-responsive sequence (TxRE: AGACGTCA, TGACGGCA, TGACCTCA) increases LTR promoter activity, as expected, but restricts the proviral loads in vivo, suggesting that repression of expression is required for immune escape (CRE mutant; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]).</p><p>(iii) formation of multinucleated syncytia by envelope dependent cell fusion in vitro is paradoxically not required for infectivity or efficient viral spread in vivo (A60V recombinant; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]).</p><p>Importantly, only the A60V envelope mutant behaves as wild type in terms of infectivity and pathogenesis, in contrast to the others (CRX3, IG4 and CRE) therefore referred to as attenuated. The two categories of viruses, either wild type (WT and A60V) or attenuated (CRX3, IG4 and CRE) thus permit to characterize and compare the processes occurring during primo-infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The extent of transient lymphocytosis is similar in sheep infected by wild type or mutant proviruses</title><p>BLV recombinants with optimized consensus CRE sequences (CRE clone) and mutants deleted in the R3 and G4 genes (CRX3 and IG4 proviruses) are impaired in their ability to propagate efficiently within their host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The early stages occurring soon after infection by these mutants and, more particularly, the extent of the transient B lymphocytosis are however unknown. Therefore, sheep were infected with well-characterized molecular clones of BLV proviruses. As control, the hematological parameters were first determined in uninfected animals, as illustrated on figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> (sheep 4533 BLV-). To this end, PBMCs (Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells) were isolated and analyzed by flow cytometry for the presence of IgM, CD4 and CD8 markers. Despite some variations in the absolute numbers of leucocytes, the B (squares), CD4<sup>+ </sup>(triangles) and CD8<sup>+ </sup>(crosses) T cell populations remained remarkably constant over extended periods of time, as expected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and data not shown for sheep 4534). In contrast, a marked increase of the absolute numbers of leucocytes occurred between 2 and 3 weeks post-inoculation of the wild type BLV provirus (from 6,331 10<sup>3</sup>/ml to 10,262 10<sup>3</sup>/ml, respectively, at days 21 and 28 in sheep 4536 BLV+ WT, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>; and data not illustrated for animal n&#x000b0; 4535).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Transient B cell lymphocytosis at seroconversion of sheep infected by BLV-mutants. </bold>A. Sheep n&#x000b0; 4536 was injected with 100 &#x003bc;g of proviral DNA (wild type strain 344 cloned into plasmid pBLV344) whereas animal n&#x000b0; 4533 was used as a negative control. At different times post-injection, leucocytes were counted using a Coulter Counter ZN and the total numbers of lymphocytes were estimated after examination under a microscope. In parallel, Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) were isolated by Percoll gradient centrifugation and the proportions of B, CD4<sup>+ </sup>T and CD8<sup>+ </sup>T-cells were determined by flow cytometry.

The bars correspond to the mean difference (&#x000b1; standard deviation) between the absolute numbers of B cells at the day of virus inoculation and those determined at seroconversion (means of three values).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1742-4690-1-31-1"/></fig><p>Phenotypic analysis of the sheep n&#x000b0; 4536 PBMCs revealed that leucocytosis is essentially due to a marked increase in the B cell numbers (from 2,294 10<sup>3</sup>/ml of blood to 4,858 10<sup>3</sup>/ml, respectively, at days 21 and day 28; see squares), while the absolute counts of CD4<sup>+ </sup>(triangles) and CD8<sup>+ </sup>(crosses) T cells remained relatively constant (as did the &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T cell population, data not shown). Furthermore, maximal B cell accumulation corresponded to the day of seroconversion characterized by the onset of an anti-BLV humoral response (the vertical line at day 28 on Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p><p>A similar experiment was performed in parallel with 4 selected BLV mutants (IG4, CRX3, CRE and GP30), the latter behaving as wild type in terms of pathogenesis and infectivity in vivo. Interestingly, B cell lymphocytosis occurred in all sheep independently of the type of provirus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, compare absolute numbers of B cells at day of seroconversion). A rate of induction was calculated by dividing the absolute numbers of the B cell population around seroconversion with those measured at the day of proviral injection (day 0). This induction rate (represented in fold increase on Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) was independent of the type of provirus, no significant difference being observed between the wild type and the mutants.</p><p>Expression of the CD5 and CD11b cluster of differentiation markers has been associated with BLV-infection, although B lymphocytes negative for these receptors are also less efficient targets for the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Therefore, we aimed to determine if lymphocytosis detected at the seroconversion period is preferentially due to an accumulation of B+CD5+ and/or B+CD11b+ cells. For this purpose, PBMCs were dually labeled with an anti-IgM antiserum together with anti-CD5 or anti-CD11b monoclonal antibodies and analyzed by two-color flow cytometry (illustrated on Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> for BLV wild type infected animal n&#x000b0; 4535: x axis = CD5 or CD11b labeling; y axis = B labeling). At day 0, two third of the B lymphocytes expressed CD5 (3,119 in a total of 1,585 + 3,119 B cells) whereas, at seroconversion, most of them became positive for this marker (6,906 cells versus 1,273). In parallel, the number of B+CD11b+ cells also drastically increased (3,547 cells at day 0 versus 7,526 at the seroconversion day). Of note, although most B lymphocytes should be CD5 and CD11b double positive cells, this assumption could not be formally demonstrated because of cross reactions between two IgG1 isotypes. However, the dot plots at right on the figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> clearly show that the majority of B cells should express both markers.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>The lymphocytosis is due to an accumulation of B lymphocytes expressing CD5 and /or CD11b. </bold>A. PBMCs were isolated from BLV wild type infected sheep (n&#x000b0; 4535) and labeled with anti-sIgM 1H4 monoclonal in combination with CD5 or CD11b antibodies. Ten thousand cells analyzed by flow cytometry are represented as dot plots (Y axis = B cells; X axis = CD5 or CD11b expressing cells).

This accumulation did not happen in the CD5- or CD11b-negative B cell populations (left panels) or in negative controls (uninfected sheep n&#x000b0; 4533 and 4534), although a relative increase was observed in some infected animals (particularly 4542 and 4543, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, B+CD5-). Importantly, the net increase of sIgM+CD5+ or sIgM+CD11b+ populations also occurred in animals infected by the different mutants independently of the type of provirus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p><p>Together, these data demonstrate that primo-infection in sheep experimentally infected either with a wild type or mutant BLV proviruses is associated with a transient lymphocytosis, extending previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. At seroconversion, all sheep exhibited a marked increase in the numbers of circulating B lymphocytes expressing for most of them the CD5 and CD11b cluster of differentiation markers and, interestingly, this phenomenon occurred independently of the type of mutant.</p></sec><sec><title>Increase of in vivo B cell proliferation during seroconversion</title><p>In terms of cell dynamics, lymphocytosis is the consequence of a homeostatic deregulation provoked by an imbalance in the rates of proliferation and/or death. Alternatively or concomitantly, the net increase in B lymphocyte numbers might be the result of a cell mobilization between the lymphatic system and the peripheral blood. We have previously established a protocol allowing to quantify these parameters in BLV-infected sheep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This experimental approach is based on intravenous injection of 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) which permits, after its incorporation into DNA, the identification by flow cytometry of cells that have undergone proliferation.</p><p>In order to label proliferating B lymphocytes during primo-infection, BrdU was injected weekly over a two months period and blood was collected at three days after each injection, a delay required for maximal detection of labeled cells (see methods) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> illustrates an example of IgM+BrdU+ dual flow cytometry analysis performed at days 0, 24 and 31 after proviral injection into sheep n&#x000b0; 4536. It appeared that the numbers of B+BrdU+ cells in this sheep increased at day 24 (cell counts of 99 at day 0 versus 385 at day 24 amongst 10,000 events) and remained high at day 31 (324 counted events). In contrast, in sheep n&#x000b0; 4533 used as a negative control, no variation was observed in terms of absolute numbers (72, 66 and 75 at days 0, 24 and 31) as well as in proportion of the sIgM-positive cell population (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, yellow bars). In BLV-infected sheep n&#x000b0; 4536, however, this relative proportion of BrdU-labeled B lymphocytes peaked at day 24, indicating that these cells underwent proliferation (black bars on Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Interestingly, the burst of B+BrdU+ cells just preceded the onset of seroconversion (vertical line at day 28 on Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>) and correlated with the mid phase of total B lymphocytes counts in the blood. The most straightforward interpretation is that the net increase of the B cell population is at least partially due to proliferation.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>The lymphocytosis correlates with increased B cell proliferation at seroconversion. </bold>Once per week over a 2 months period, 500 mg of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) were injected intravenously into BLV-infected (n&#x000b0; 4536) and control (n&#x000b0; 4533) sheep. An aliquot of blood (1 ml) was collected at three days post-BrdU injection. After lysis of the red blood cells, B lymphocytes were labeled with an anti-sIgM antibody.

Using real-time PCR, the proviral loads were estimated to be 270 and 245 copies per 1,000 cells in sheep infected, respectively, with the wild type virus and the GP30 recombinant whereas the levels yielded by the other mutants were significantly reduced (27, 40 and 24 copies / 1,000 cells for IG4, CRX3 and CRE, respectively).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1742-4690-1-31-5"/></fig><p>Together these data show that, around the seroconversion period, the proviral loads are reduced in sheep infected by attenuated mutants.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have studied here the interplay between the efficiency of viral spread, the cellular proliferation within the host and the extent of cell accumulation during the period consecutive to the infection of sheep by bovine leukemia virus. We compared two categories of viruses based on their ability to infect and expand within their host: those behaving as wild type (WT and GP30) or so-called attenuated mutants (IG4, CRX3 and CRE). Experimental infection of sheep with these two types of viruses led to a surprising observation, namely, a similar extent of transient lymphocytosis independently of the proviral loads (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). In other words, the total B lymphocyte accumulation within the peripheral blood is not modulated by the amount of viral copies. Another contribution of this report is the demonstration that transient lymphocytosis arising just prior to seroconversion is at least partially due to an increase in B cell proliferation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). In fact, since lymphocytes rest within the peripheral blood in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle (unpublished data), proliferation occurs in other sites i.e. the bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes and Peyer's Patches. Therefore, the accumulation of BrdU+ B lymphocytes might also be the consequence of an increased outflow from these sources estimated, in non-infected sheep, at 30 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells per gram of lymph node in one hour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Conversely, impaired recirculation to the lymphatic system would also create an imbalance in the B lymphocyte counts (1 g of lymph node receives 1.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8 </sup>cells per hour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]). Answering to this question would require canulation of lymph nodes allowing the precise quantification of the cellular flows.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Schematized summary of proliferation rates, proviral loads and lymphocytosis associated with primo-infection. </bold>Sheep, which were experimentally infected with BLV wild type or mutant proviruses (virus inoculation), exhibited a similar extent of transient accumulation of B-lymphocytes (&#x02014;). This transient lymphocytosis arising just before seroconversion is at least partially due to an increase in B cell proliferation (peak of B cell proliferation &#x02022;&#x02022;&#x02022;&#x02022;&#x02022;). In contrast, the proviral loads greatly differ among the two categories of sheep, e.g. infected with wild type (- - -) or attenuated viruses (&#x02014; &#x02022;&#x02022;).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1742-4690-1-31-6"/></fig><p>With the aim to correlate lymphocytosis with a defined B cell sub-population, we have demonstrated that two surface molecules, CD5 and CD11b, whose expression has been previously associated with late stages of BLV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] are also important markers at the seroconversion period. In human and mice, the B lymphocytes expressing the CD5 and CD11b proteins are referred to as B-1a cells. B lymphocytes that are CD5- and CD11b+ are called B-1b and have a similar function than the B-1a subset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Compared to the conventional B-2 cells (e.g. CD5- CD11b-), the B-1 population exhibits different developmental schemes, phenotypes, antibody repertoires, localization and behaviors. In humans, elevated numbers of B-1 cells have been reported in patients with Sjorgen's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and AIDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In mice, increased numbers of B-1 cells have been observed in a number of naturally occurring and genetically manipulated strains that develop autoimmune manifestations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. B-1 cells are believed to be the major source of natural IgM, a polyreactive and weakly autoreactive antibody, which is produced in the absence of exogenous antigenic stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Consistent with this model, IgM specificities within the B-1 repertoire include phosphorylcholine, phosphatidylcholine, thymocytes, lipopolysaccharide and influenza virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Interestingly, in sheep, the B-1 population also expands in response to infection with other pathogens like <italic>Trypanosoma evansi </italic>and <italic>Pasteurella haemolytica </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In this context, we speculate about an opportunistic mechanism of BLV replication supported by a general activation of B-1a lymphocyte proliferation, which could thus be a primary B-cell humoral response. Successive divisions of B-1a cells would thereby expand the number of potential targets for the virus. During this period, the ability of the virus to colonize new cells would be crucial, a fact that is reflected by the differential proviral loads between the wild type and attenuated viruses.</p><p>Differences in the infectious potential of the attenuated viruses are the consequence of mutations in accessory genes (R3 and G4) or in the LTR promoter (CRE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Although the role of R3 is still unknown, its homologue expressed by HTLV-1 (p12) interacts with the IL-2 receptor as well as with calcineurin and is crucial during the initial steps of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. BLV G4 and HTLV-1 p13 bind to the same cellular protein, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] but modulate differentially cell transformation in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The defect in BLV propagation associated with the CRE mutant relates to its inability to repress basal expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Optimization of the imperfect CRE enhancer sequences present in the LTR creates a more efficient promoter, as expected, but restricts the proviral loads indicating that transcriptional silencing is required for viral persistence and spread. The reduced capacity of the CRE, G4 and R3 mutants to propagate are thus caused by different genetic defects and data presented in this report further extent our previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. More surprisingly is the replication efficiency exhibited by the GP30 envelope mutant. Unable to induce membrane fusion, at least as measured by classical syncytia formation tests, the GP30 virus propagates at wild type levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Besides a possible experimental caveat based on the lack of sensitivity of the syncytium assay in vitro, our previous (and most straightforward) hypothesis postulated that viral spread mainly occurred via clonal expansion of the infected lymphocytes with few or non-limiting cell-to-cell transmissions. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> demonstrates that the proviral loads of the GP30 mutant are at wild type levels even during the early steps of infection, a period thought to be associated with active infection of novel cells. Preliminary inverse PCR amplification data indicate that the number of target cells carrying integrated GP30 or wild type proviruses are not significantly different (F. Mortreux, ongoing work). We thus have to reconsider our interpretation and propose that the syncytium assay does not reflect the infectious potential in vivo. In terms of its biological properties in sheep, the GP30 recombinant should thus be considered as, or close to, wild type at least during primo-infection.</p><p>In conclusion, we have characterized here the initial steps consecutive to BLV infection of sheep. We show that this period is characterized by a transient accumulation of CD5+ / CD11b+ B lymphocytes resulting, at least in part, from increased proliferation. Furthermore, the extent of B cell lymphocytosis is not directly linked to the proviral loads reached by the wild type and mutant viruses. On basis of a comparative leukemia approach, these results could be informative for the related human T-lymphotropic viruses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Experimental animals</title><p>Twelve sheep of one year old were kept under controlled conditions at the Veterinary and Agrochemical Research Centre (Machelen, Belgium).
