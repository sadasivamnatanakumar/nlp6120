However, the &#x003b1;7 nicotinic receptor has been recently found in several non-neuronal cells and described as an important regulator of cellular function. Nicotine and ACh have been recently reported to inhibit tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) production in human macrophages as well as in mouse microglial cultures. In the present study, we investigated whether the stimulation of &#x003b1;7 nicotinic receptor by the specific agonist nicotine could affect the functional state of activated microglia by promoting and/or inhibiting the release of other important pro-inflammatory and lipid mediator such as prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Expression of &#x003b1;7 nicotinic receptor in rat microglial cell was examined by RT-PCR, immunofluorescence staining and Western blot. The functional effects of &#x003b1;7 receptor activation were analyzed in resting or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated microglial cells pre-treated with nicotine. Culture media were assayed for the levels of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1&#x003b2;, nitric oxide, interleukin-10 and prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>.

By contrast, nicotine enhances the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and the synthesis of one of its major products, prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Since prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>modulates several macrophage and lymphocyte functions, which are instrumental for inflammatory resolution, our study further supports the existence of a brain cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway mediated by &#x003b1;7 nicotinic receptor that could be potentially exploited for novel treatments of several neuropathologies in which local inflammation, sustained by activated microglia, plays a crucial role.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Brain macrophages</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>TNF</kwd><kwd>IL-10</kwd><kwd>Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The inflammatory response is in the first instance a mechanism of self-defense, set by the innate immune system against endogenous and exogenous insults, and essential for the survival of the organism. Inflammation must be tightly regulated as deficiency as well as excess in its response will result in pathological conditions, such as immunodeficiency or chronic inflammatory diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In the last decade increasing evidence has highlighted the role of inflammation in most brain pathologies, including immune-mediated diseases such as multiple sclerosis, acute neurodegeneration following ischemia or trauma, and, more recently, chronic neurodegenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Among the endogenous mechanisms that regulate the inflammatory response, cross-talk between the immune and nervous systems play an important role. In particular, it has been shown that electric stimulation of the vagus nerve attenuates the inflammation during endotoxemia in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and that acetylcholine (ACh), the main parasympathetic neurotransmitter, effectively deactivates peripheral macrophages and inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, including the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;). The ACh-dependent macrophage deactivation is mediated by the &#x003b1;7 subunit of the nicotinic ACh receptor (herein referred as &#x003b1;7 subunit), which is expressed in peripheral macrophages and has been described as essential for the so called "cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Neuronal acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are ligand-gated ion channels, which belong to a large family of neurotransmitter receptors that includes the GABA<sub>A</sub>, glycine and 5-HT<sub>3 </sub>receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Each nAChR consists of five homologous or identical subunits arranged around a central ion channel whose opening is controlled by ACh, nicotine and other receptor agonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. At least 8 &#x003b1; subunits (&#x003b1;2&#x02013;9) and three &#x003b2; subunits (&#x003b2;2&#x02013;4) have been identified and the combinatorial association of different &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits results in a variety of nAChRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>In addition to neurons and peripheral macrophages, several studies have demonstrated the expression of nAChRs in cell types both within and outside the nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In the CNS, the presence of nAChRs has been demonstrated in O<sub>2</sub>A-oligodendrocyte precursor cells but not in adult differentiated oligodendrocytes, suggesting that receptor expression is developmentally regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Cultured hippocampal astrocytes express functional &#x003b1;7 receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and cortical astrocytes express both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. A functional &#x003b1;7 nicotinic receptor has been recently described in murine microglial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In peripheral organs, human and rat epithelial and endothelial cells express functional &#x003b1;7 receptors, as well as other nicotinic subunits such as &#x003b1;3, &#x003b1;5, &#x003b2;2 and &#x003b2;4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Acute or chronic exposure to nicotine has been shown to influence cell viability and motility of bronchial epithelial and endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, nicotine has been shown to suppress the antimicrobial activities of murine alveolar macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Lymphocytes present both muscarinic and nicotinic receptors and it has been demonstrated that the interaction with antigen presenting cells enhances the synthesis and release of ACh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These observations suggest that ACh might function as an important modulator of cellular interactions and immune functions.</p><p>Epidemiological studies indicate that nicotine, besides its immunosuppressive effects, may be protective against the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], in which a local inflammatory response is sustained by microglial cells, the largest population of phagocytes associated with the CNS. In normal healthy brain, microglial cells show a typical down-regulated or "resting" phenotype when compared to other tissue macrophages, but they rapidly react in response to a number of acute and chronic insults. Activated microglial cells could cause neuronal damage via liberation of free radicals as well as cytokines and toxic factors. Alternatively, microglia can exert neuroprotective functions by secreting growth factors or diffusible anti-inflammatory mediators, which contribute to resolve inflammation and restore tissue homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms governing microglial activation is essential to prevent tissue damage related to excessive activation. Since nicotine and ACh have been recently reported to inhibit TNF-&#x003b1; production in mouse microglial cultures, the aim of our study was to extend our knowledge on the effect of &#x003b1;7 subunit stimulation on the functional state of activated microglia. We first confirmed that rat microglia express the &#x003b1;7 subunit and we demonstrated that, in addition to inhibit TNF-&#x003b1;, the &#x003b1;7 agonist nicotine significantly up-regulated COX-2 expression and PGE<sub>2 </sub>synthesis. Other important microglial products, such as interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;), nitric oxide (NO) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were not affected or moderately decreased.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>All cell culture reagents were from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, U.S.A) and virtually endotoxin free (less then 10 E.U./ml as determined by the manufacturer).

Microglial cells, harvested from the mixed primary glial cultures by mild shaking, were resuspended in Basal Eagle's Medium (BME) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml gentamicin, and plated on uncoated plastic wells at a density of 1.25 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/cm<sup>2</sup>. Cells were allowed to adhere for 20 min and then washed to remove non-adhering cells. After a 24 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing the substance(s) under study. Cell viability was greater than 95%, as tested by Trypan Blue exclusion. Immunostaining, performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], revealed that cultures consisted of &#x02265; 99% positive cells for the microglia/macrophage marker ED1. Microglial cells were pre-stimulated for 30 min with nicotine and then stimulated for 24 h in the presence of 10 ng/ml LPS. A rat pheochromocytoma cell line, PC12, was propagated and maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10% heat-inactivated horse serum (HS) 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 &#x003bc;g/ml of streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine.

The levels of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-10 were assayed by specific ELISAs, following the manufacturer's instructions. The ranges of determination were: 31&#x02013;2500 pg/ml for TNF-&#x003b1;, 10&#x02013;1000 pg/ml and 8&#x02013;500 pg/ml for IL-10.

After a 24 h of incubation, the complete BME medium was replaced with fresh BME medium without serum. Cells were incubated at 4&#x000b0;C for 15 min with FITC-labeled &#x003b1;-bungarotoxin at 1.5 &#x003bc;g/ml. Where indicated, nicotine was added at the concentration of 500 &#x003bc;M for 10 min, in order to saturate all the binding sites before the addition of FITC-labeled &#x003b1;-bungarotoxin. Cells were washed 3 times with BME medium and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min. After fixation, coverslips were washed twice with PBS solution, mounted in PBS:glycerol and examined using a fluorescent microscope. Cell culture lysates from microglial cells and PC12 cells (used as positive control) were analyzed for &#x003b1;7 subunit expression. Total protein content was estimated using the Bio-Rad protein assay. An aliquot corresponding to 50 &#x003bc;g (microglia cells) and 20 &#x003bc;g (PC12 cells) of total protein for each sample was separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel elecrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred electrophoretically to nylon membranes. Membranes were blocked with 10% non-fat milk and incubated with a rabbit policlonal antibodies against &#x003b1;7 subunit (1:2000) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000, 1 h at 25&#x000b0;C) and ECL reagents were used as detection system.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction and semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis</title><p>Total RNA was prepared from rat microglia, PC12 cells and rat hippocampus using Trizol reagent according to manufacturer's protocol.

PCR conditions (number of cycles and cDNA and primer concentration) that ensure the data to be obtained within the exponential phase of amplification of each template were carefully assessed. The amplification of the &#x003b2;-actin, COX-2 and &#x003b1;7 subunit within the exponential phase of amplification was achieved with 25, 30 and 40 cycles respectively.</p><p>Five &#x003bc;l, 15 &#x003bc;l and 40 &#x003bc;l of diluted cDNAs were amplified for &#x003b2;-actin, COX-2 and &#x003b1;7 respectively.

A sample containing all reaction reagents except cDNA was used as PCR negative control in each experiment. The absence of genomic DNA was verified using 2 &#x003bc;g of RNA from microglia that was reverse-transcribed without the enzyme (-RT). The PCR conditions for COX-2 were as follows: initial denaturation at 94&#x000b0;C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 30 sec, 58&#x000b0;C for 45 sec, 68&#x000b0;C for 1 min, and an additional cycle with extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 7 min. The PCR conditions for &#x003b2;-actin were as follows: initial denaturation at 94&#x000b0;C for 5 min followed by 25 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 30 sec, 68&#x000b0;C for 30 sec, 68&#x000b0;C for 45 sec and an additional cycle with extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 1 min.

The absence of genomic DNA contamination was demonstrated amplifying 2 &#x003bc;g of total RNA from microglia that was reverse-transcribed without the enzyme (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).

The expression of &#x003b1;7 subunit at protein level was established by western blot analysis using a specific antibody for the &#x003b1;7 subunit, which recognized a clear band with a molecular mass of approximately 55 kD from both microglial cells and PC12 cells, used as a positive control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The expression of the receptor was confirmed by labeling microglial cells with FITC-labeleled-&#x003b1;-bungarotoxin (&#x003b1;-Bgtx), a selective nicotinic antagonist.

First, we have confirmed using rat microglial cells previous data showing that murine microglia express the &#x003b1;7 subunit and that their exposure to the specific agonist nicotine reduces LPS-induced release of the pro-inflammatory molecule TNF-&#x003b1;, thus suggesting that these events are not species specific.</p><p>Furthermore, we extended the analysis of &#x003b1;7 subunit activation to other important microglial functions, including the synthesis of mediators possessing anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activities. We found that in LPS-activated microglial cells, the interaction of &#x003b1;7 subunit with its agonist nicotine had moderate or no effect on the release of NO, IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-10. By contrast, nicotine treatment significantly increased the expression of COX-2 and the synthesis of PGE<sub>2</sub>. The effect of nicotine on the LPS-induced PGE<sub>2 </sub>release was significantly reversed by the specific antagonist of &#x003b1;7 subunit, &#x003b1;-bungarotoxin, demonstrating the involvement of &#x003b1;7 nicotinic receptors in the induction of PGE<sub>2 </sub>production by activated microglial cells.</p><p>COX-2 is the inducible isoform of the enzyme responsible for the first committed step in PGE<sub>2 </sub>synthesis, one of the major prostaglandins produced during inflammatory response and potent modulator of several macrophage and lymphocyte functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Within the brain, COX-2 activity and PGE<sub>2 </sub>production, depending on their levels of induction, have been associated with both protective and harmful effects on neurons and glial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In microglial cells, COX-2 is the major isoform, rapidly induced by LPS stimulation or interaction with apoptotic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The constitutive isoform COX-1 is only moderately expressed by these cells and is not up-regulated during their activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>PGE<sub>2 </sub>has been found to be neuroprotective in several experimental settings. At nanomolar concentrations, PGE<sub>2 </sub>protects hippocampal and cortical neuronal cultures against excitotoxic injury or LPS-induced cytotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In hippocampal neuronal and organotypic cultures, the protective effect of PGE<sub>2 </sub>against glutamate and oxygen deprivation is mediated by the activation of the EP2 receptor, one of the four PGE<sub>2 </sub>receptor subtypes whose activation leads to cAMP formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The protective effect of EP2 receptor activity has been confirmed in vivo, in a model of transient forebrain ischemia, in which the genetic deletion of this PGE<sub>2 </sub>receptor exacerbates the extent of neuronal damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. On the other hand, at concentrations in the &#x003bc;M &#x02013; mM range, PGE<sub>2 </sub>contributes to neuronal death and stimulates release of glutamate by astrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>PGE<sub>2 </sub>has also been shown to down-regulate microglial activation and expression of pro-inflammatory genes, including TNF-&#x003b1;, both in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We have recently found that the interaction of microglial cells with apoptotic neurons promotes the synthesis of PGE<sub>2 </sub>along with neuroprotective and immunoregulatory molecules such as TGF-&#x003b2; and NGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In this system, the release of PGE<sub>2 </sub>is triggered by the specific interaction between phosphatidylserine, a phospholipid exposed on the cell surface during the initial phase of apoptosis, with its cognate receptor expressed by microglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], consistent with previous studies on peripheral macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. It has been suggested that the PGE<sub>2</sub>, released by macrophages engulfing apoptotic cells, contributes to one of the main features of apoptotic cell death, namely the efficient removal of dying cells without eliciting inflammation in the surrounding tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. It is therefore tempting to speculate that the &#x003b1;7 subunit-dependent increase of PGE<sub>2 </sub>in activated microglia cells is part of an anti-inflammatory pathway regulated by the cholinergic system. The detection of microglial cells, astrocyte processes and choline acetyltransferase- (ChAT-) positive fibers around &#x003b2;-amyloid plaques in transgenic APP<sub>SW </sub>mice suggests a close connection between cholinergic terminals and microglial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. A deficit in ACh level due to loss of cholinergic neurons associated with AD as well as aging could contribute to the establishment of chronic inflammation rendering microglial cells more susceptible towards environmental changes and orientating them towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype. However, to date there is no definitive evidence of a causal link between loss of cholinergic neurons and increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF.</p><p>In the last few years, several lines of evidence have suggested that activation of &#x003b1;7 subunits plays an important role in the maintenance of cognitive functions in several neurodegenerative disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Epidemiological studies have shown that cigarette smoking can be protective against the development of AD, PD and other types of dementia, suggesting that chronic inhalation of nicotine may slow the progression of these neurodegenerative diseases or improve some cognitive responses in AD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Loss of nAChRs has been reported in patients with diverse forms of dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. In particular, a reduction in &#x003b1;7 subunit number was detected in AD and PD brain tissue specimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The administration of ligands targeting nicotinic receptors in animal models of neurodegeneration, as well as in humans, induced cognitive improvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] and conferred neuroprotection against several neurotoxic agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Furthermore, cholinesterase inhibitors used in the symptomatic treatment of AD have been reported to exert additional benefits through the increased density of specific nicotinic receptor subunits (including the &#x003b1;7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. This effect could be relevant in view of the anti-inflammatory role suggested for the &#x003b1;7 subunit.</p><p>As mentioned in the introduction, the presence of &#x003b1;7 subunit on immune cells as well as on other non-excitable cells has provided a molecular basis for a non-neuronal cholinergic pathway that might function as an essential regulator of inflammation as well as immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Primary cultures of astrocytes and microglia show ChAT activity and synthesize acetylcholine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Accordingly, we have found the expression of ChAT mRNA in both resting and activated microglia cells (unpublished results). This suggests that this neurotransmitter may act as a local hormone and contribute to the regulation of microglial functions.</p><p>It should be noted that although our study focused on the effects of nicotine on the process of microglial activation induced by LPS, our findings may have broader implications since other microglial activators, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and fibrillogenic peptides, share some common signaling pathways with LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. In addition, it has been recently reported that the LPS receptor CD14 interacts with fibrils of Alzheimer amyloid peptide and a deficiency of this receptor significantly reduces fibril-induced microglial activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].</p><p>At present, the signaling pathways downstream to &#x003b1;7 subunit activation and leading, in particular, to COX-2 and PGE<sub>2 </sub>up-regulation is under investigation. Shytle <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] have reported that either ACh or nicotine inhibit LPS-induced phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases p44/42 and p38 in murine microglia. We have recently found a reduction of p38 phosphorylation in two experimental settings in which exposure of microglial cells to phosphatidylserine vesicles &#x02013; mimicking apopototic neurons &#x02013; or to chronic activation stimuli, resulted in downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and in enhancement of PGE<sub>2 </sub>synthetic pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], thus suggesting that p38 may also have a role in &#x003b1;7 dependent up-regulation of COX-2.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Activation of &#x003b1;7 nicotinic receptors in microglial cells by nicotine controls some important microglial functions, thus preventing chronic inflammation. Since microglial activation and chronic inflammation have been associated with most neurodegenerative pathologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] the understanding of the molecular pathway(s) triggered by &#x003b1;7 subunit activation in microglial cells will offer new venues for potential pharmacological regulation of microglial activation in neurodegenerative diseases. At the same time, the development of molecules able to stimulate the &#x003b1;7 subunit may represent a potential promising approach for the treatment of these disorders.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)</p><p>Acetylcholine (ACh)</p><p>Neuronal acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs)</p><p>Tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;)</p><p>Prostaglandin E<sub>2 </sub>(PGE<sub>2</sub>)</p><p>Interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;)</p><p>Nitric oxide (NO)</p><p>Interleukin-10 (IL-10)</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>RDS conceived of the study, participated in its design and coordination, produced the primary microglial cultures, performed the ELISA and the immunofluorescence staining, was primarily responsible of the RT-PCR review the data and drafted the manuscript.
