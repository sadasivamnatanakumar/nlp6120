This cross-sectional study explores the concept of parental and peer attachment, which has been researched for its ability to predict students&#x02019; success in higher education. Yet, less research has investigated the mechanisms underpinning the relationship between attachment and university adjustment among first-year students. Hence, the aim of this study was to examine the impact of parent and peer attachment on first-year university students, and understand how these attachments can facilitate university adjustment through identity exploration. This investigation is underpinned by Bowlby and Ainsworth&#x02019;s attachment theory and Arnett&#x02019;s emerging adulthood theory. Data were collected from 568 first-year students at a public university in Sabah, Malaysia, via adapted questionnaires. Structural equation modelling was employed using SmartPLS Software 3.0 to analyse the data. The study found that identity exploration mediates the relationship between parental trust, peer communication, and university adjustment. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for professionals working with emerging adult clients, especially those in higher education institutions, aiming to enhance the adjustment level among first-year students.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="0"/><table-count count="4"/><page-count count="21"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>The data underlying the results presented in the study are available from <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8033896" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8033896</ext-link>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>The data underlying the results presented in the study are available from <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8033896" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8033896</ext-link>.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Studies on adjustment suggest that it is a diverse and complex phenomenon [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. According to previous research, students who are able to adjust at university have better academic results, fewer social problems, and less stress [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is the university&#x02019;s priority to provide adequate services and facilities to encourage adjustment among first-year students [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The Ministry of Education Malaysia efforts to develop programmes to improve facilities and support programmes are motivated by the fact that many students do not complete their university studies [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Despite the ministry&#x02019;s long-standing efforts, the issue of student adjustment, particularly among first-year students, remains a major concern in Malaysia [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. University life has its own set of expectations, including but not limited to students&#x02019; dedication to the institution, their participation in campus-wide events, their general happiness and success as individuals, and their academic performance. Adjustment at a university can be seen by looking at personal qualities or behaviour patterns that have the desired value in an environment [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A student is said to be adaptable at a university if he is able to socially integrate with the campus residents, is involved in campus activities, meets academic requirements, and is committed to the higher education institution [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294658.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. If students are unable to adapt to all of the demands of the university environment, they are likely to drop out of their studies. In order to improve adjustment at university, this study focuses on the factors of parent-peer connection as well as the experience of emerging adulthood from the perspective of identity exploration.</p><p>The relationship between attachment and identity has been widely studied and supported by numerous researchers. [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294658.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] are considered pioneers in the field of attachment theory, which emphasizes the importance of early attachment experiences in shaping an individual&#x02019;s social and emotional development. They proposed that individuals who develop secure attachment styles are more likely to form positive identities and have better social and emotional adjustment throughout their lives. Recent studies have also provided support for the relationship between attachment and identity. [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] conducted a study exploring the relationship between attachment, identity, and academic performance in college students. They found that individuals with secure attachment styles had a stronger sense of identity and performed better academically. Similarly, [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] found that attachment styles were significantly related to identity formation in adolescents. [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] also found that individuals with secure attachment styles had higher levels of identity achievement than those with insecure attachment styles.</p><p>Moreover, research has consistently demonstrated the significance of the interplay between attachment and identity in university adjustment. [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] discovered that the combination of attachment and identity predicted college adjustment, specifically in areas of academic achievement and social integration. Similarly, [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] found that attachment and identity interacted to predict university adjustment; individuals with high levels of both constructs experienced the most favorable adjustment outcomes. Other studies have established that attachment is a precursor to identity and, as a result, is linked to heightened levels of adjustment. [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] observed that attachment security was positively associated with identity development during late adolescence, while [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] determined that individuals with secure attachment styles experienced better adjustment outcomes during early adulthood. Additionally, recent studies, such as [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], have reported that secure attachment plays a pivotal role in molding an individual&#x02019;s identity, particularly in terms of self-concept. Finally, [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294658.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] conducted studies exploring the relationship between attachment, identity, and mental health outcomes. They found that individuals with insecure attachment styles and poor identity integration had higher levels of anxiety and depression. In conclusion, the research supports the important relationship between attachment and identity, as well as the combination of both constructs on university adjustment. Attachment is a predictor of identity and, consequently, a high level of adjustment, highlighting the importance of early attachment experiences in shaping individuals&#x02019; development.</p><p>Although some studies have looked at the role of identity exploration as a mediator between parental attachment and university adjustment [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294658.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294658.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, the literature review does not suggest investigating identity as a distinct construct with both positive and negative aspects. As a result, this study suggests that the emerging adulthood experience constructs emerge as a form of identity exploration. The main challenge of emerging adults in university, according to [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], is the exploration of identity. There are five emerging adulthood experiences, three of which are positive (identity exploration, self-focus, and a period of possibility) and two of which are negative (instability and feeling &#x0201c;in-between&#x0201d;). As a result, this study adds to the literature by examining the emerging adulthood experience through the lens of identity exploration as a mediator in the relationship between parental attachment, peer attachment, and university adaptation.</p><sec id="sec002"><title>The importance of parental and peer attachment</title><p>Theoretically, university adjustment is frequently linked to Bowlby and Ainsworth&#x02019;s attachment theory, which examines the parent and peer attachment constructs [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294658.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Many previous empirical studies have investigated the role of parent and peer attachment on university adjustment [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. According to [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], a separation from parents and identity exploration are also active during this sensitive transition period. This results in an unstable period in which students are exposed to stressful and provocative situations [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In comparison to students who have an insecure attachment to their parents, students who have a secure attachment to their parents have a positive view of academics, are motivated, do good academic work, tend to adapt at university, and have the ability to build a protective emotional, behavioural, and social problem [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A secure relationship with parents can provide students with a sense of acceptance that allows them to try out a new role and make decisions independently while remaining comfortable knowing that their parents support their behaviour. Previous research has shown that attachment shifts from parents to peers as a person grows older [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] initially believed that attachment relationships were formed between infants and parents (particularly mothers), but that attachment had shifted to peers as a healthy development among adolescents based on life development. In fact, friendships continue to be important well into adulthood [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Peers are more influential in the adjustment process than parents are during the university years [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>The importance of identity exploration</title><p>Many studies have been discussed in the literature on factors that can influence adjustment at university, and one of them is the exploration of identity [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] proposed that there is a long-term adolescent in a typical industrialised society. [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] observed that many young people today have not yet developed a strong commitment to maturity until the age of 25 or more because they are still actively exploring their identity over a long period of time. This stage is known as emerging adulthood. Most studies agree that entering an institutional structure such as a university increases indicators of well-being among young people [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The current stage of development at university can foster experiences such as broad opportunities for exploration in a variety of contexts such as cognitive, social, and psychological development, which can influence learning, social activities, and interaction with others [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294658.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Adjustment as a life transitional process</title><p>For the purpose of this study, [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] model of ecological transition and individual development will be utilised to investigate specifically how first-year college students adapt to their new environments. The research asserted that the transition process can occur in two ways: either separately and in detail, such as the transition from one state/place to another (eg: entry into the university world), or slowly and gradually, such as the developmental or evolutionary transition from one form or stage to other forms or stages (eg: child and adult development). According to this viewpoint, life transitions can be identified in two ways: ecological transitions and individual developmental transitions.</p><p>According to [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], individual development occurs slowly and gradually, or from one stage to the next (For example, the emerging adulthood period). During the emerging adulthood period, development takes place primarily in five domains: identity exploration, instability, self-focus, feeling &#x0201c;in-between,&#x0201d; and full of possibilities [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Emerging adulthood period is said to be unstable as a result of changes in planning, such as autonomous relationships with parents and romantic relationships [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Adjustment is therefore associated with changes in one&#x02019;s ability to understand others and have new ideas when negotiating relationships with parents [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. These unique emerging adult experiences develop continuously between the ages of 18 and 29 years [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and serve as the foundation for life development in later adulthood. During this time, students are more actively exploring their identities in order to discover who they truly are. Although identity formation begins in adolescence [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], it is more active and intense during the emerging adulthood period [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The period of transitioning also leads to emerging adults becoming more self-focused, i.e., more responsible for themselves and free to make decisions without being influenced by others and not being bound by societal norms in particular [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The demands and challenges of emerging adulthood are distinct, and adjustment is associated with achieving a level of self-sufficiency [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. To achieve the goal of better understanding themselves, emerging adults are given the freedom to explore their potential and live a changing lifestyle.</p><p>An ecological transition occurs when a person&#x02019;s situation in the ecological environment changes due to a change in role, place, or both [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. According to [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], ecological transitions have two characteristics: normative transitions and non-normative transitions. If a person anticipates an ecological transition, that person is said to have a normative ecological transition. According to [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], emerging adulthood normative ecological transitions include work, university, and marriage. These transitions during the emerging adulthood period demonstrate that changes occur not only in terms of personal development but also in terms of location and residence. When an individual does not anticipate a change in conditions or location, a non-normative ecological transition occurs. The ecological transition is normative in the context of this study because adults develop the expectation that adjustment is required during the transition to university. One of the situations that all emerging adults face is the separation from friends due to a change in residence [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. As a result, emerging adults must understand how to adapt to social networks and feel a part of a new community [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Typically, the transition from childhood to adulthood involves not only changes in personal development but also ecological changes that describe an unexpected change in place or role. Individual development and ecological transition, according to [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], must go hand in hand in the transition of life. If the individual does not experience self-development during the ecological transition, the &#x0201c;developmental mismatch hypothesis&#x0201d;, which is based on the concept of person-environment, will occur [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This concept emphasizes the responsibility of the individual to adapt to a specific or appropriate environment. Rationally, emerging adults in an ecological transition, which in the context of this study is a transition in university, require self-development, which is a period of adulthood that develops concurrently. It is necessary to actively explore one&#x02019;s identity during the transition to university in order to improve one&#x02019;s adjustment at university. If one of the transitions fails, it can result in &#x0201c;developmental mismatch&#x0201d;, which can lead to a current crisis at the university. This is due to the individual&#x02019;s development status not matching the roles and demands available in the new and foreign university environment.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Linking theory of attachment and theory of emerging adulthood</title><p>The transition to adulthood is said to present ecological and personal development challenges. Emerging adults experience changes in cognitive, biological, emotional, identity, perspective, relationship, achievement, role, responsibility, and other context [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. From a developmental perspective, the transition to adulthood is fluctuating. However, [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294658.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] see it as a time of excitement and openness. According to [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], the vast majority of young adults are choosing to continue their education at a college or university. Higher education institutions are the best example of institutions that can offer opportunities and challenges for development that are appropriate for emerging adults [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Furthermore, university life is a &#x0201c;social island&#x0201d; distinct from the rest of society, providing a safe haven for emerging adults to explore opportunities in romance, work, and outlook on life [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294658.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. As a result, the transition to the university world can be seen as an ecological transition that requires adults to adapt and take on new roles. Previous attachment theory research mostly focused on the effects of parent and peer attachment on university adjustment. As such, this study connects the theory of attachment and the theory of emerging adulthood in order to better understand and extend the theoretical framework. The researcher created a conceptual framework for the study by combining attachment theory and emerging adulthood theory. This study&#x02019;s conceptual framework as shown in S1 Fig in <xref rid="pone.0294658.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref> suggests a link between parental attachment and peer attachment to individual developmental transitions (emerging adulthood experiences) and then to ecological transitions (university adjustment).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Method</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study design</title><p>This cross-sectional study targeted first-year students aged between 18 and 25, attending university full-time. A total of 700 survey forms were distributed to first-year students at a public university in Sabah, Malaysia. Of these, 103 were not returned. Upon data entry, 29 surveys were deemed ineligible for use. Sixteen of these were incomplete, and four were excluded because the respondent&#x02019;s age exceeded the predetermined range. Additionally, nine surveys raised concerns of bias in the responses, evident from a pattern that appeared to be straight-lining. Therefore, of the total distributed surveys, 568 were verified as complete, accurate, eligible, and consistent for subsequent analysis. G*Power was utilized to determine the minimum sample size required to achieve statistical power [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. This study&#x02019;s model includes 4 predictors. Using G*Power with an effect size of 0.15, alpha of 0.05, and power of 0.95, the required minimum sample size was only 129. As a result, our study&#x02019;s sample size of 568 is sufficient, and the results can be confidently reported.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Study setting</title><p>The study was conducted at a public university in Sabah, Malaysia.

The researcher begins by contacting the university lecturers in identifying a few initial participants who meet the inclusive criteria, such as being in the aged of 18&#x02013;29 and full-time public university student. Prior to taking the survey, all participants were given an information sheet outlining the purpose of the study, what their participation entailed, and the confidentiality of their responses. Prior to their participation, each participant provided written consent. These initial participants were then asked to invite their friends and classmates who also meet the inclusion criteria by sending them the survey link. The process of recruitment then continues with each participant sharing the link or invitation with their network of contacts who also meet the inclusion criteria, and so on. Data was collected over a two-week period in May 2015. A total of 600 questionnaires were collected, however 32 questionnaires were being omitted due to incomplete responses.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Instruments</title><p>The instruments used in this study are divided into four sections, from Section A to D.</p><sec id="sec011"><title>Section A: Demographic characteristics</title><p>Section A consisted of questions about sociodemographic profiles, such as gender, age, highest level of education, and ethnic group.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Section B: Student Adaptation to College Questionnaire (SACQ)</title><p>The SACQ measurement tool developed by [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] was used to assess university students&#x02019; adjustment. The SACQ is made up of four sub-scales that assess four aspects of university adjustment (academic, social, personal-emotion, institutional attachment) in first-year students. The SACQ survey tool contains 67 items that use five-point Likert scales (1 = never happens to me, 5 = very often happens to me). Respondents were instructed to respond to the question items by stating how much the statements currently (in the last few days) apply to them. According to the SACQ manual, the institutional adjustment sub-scale contains nine items drawn from the academic (item no. 36) and social (items no. 1, 4, 16, 26, 42, 56, 57, and 65) sub-scales. According to [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], these nine items correlate to the sub-scale of institutional attachment in their research sample of Clark University students. SmartPLS, on the other hand, cannot analyse items that share sub-scales. As a result, the nine items on the institutional attachment sub-scale were not used in this study. While two items with the numbers 53 and 67 are not used in this study, the researcher who created the SACQ questionnaire never explained why these two items were included in the SACQ questionnaire but not linked to the four sub-scales, resulting in a total of 67 items [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Section C: Inventory of Parent and Peers Attachment (IPPA)</title><p>IPPA is comprised of three distinct constructs: trust, communication, and alienation. The revised version of IPPA [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], containing 50 items, was used for this study. In the first section, the researcher used 25 items, which asked respondents about their attachment to parents or people who act as parents. Meanwhile, the second section contains 25 items in which respondents are asked how they feel about their best friends. Respondents were asked to rate how true the statement was for them right now. Respondents used five-point Likert scales to express their level of agreement (1&#x02014;almost never, never true, and 5&#x02014;almost always, always true). In this particular investigation, we focused solely on the trust and communication dimensions of the IPPA instrument.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Section D: Inventory of Dimensions of Emerging Adulthood experiences (IDEA)</title><p>The IDEA scale is used to assess the identity exploration. [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] created this research instrument, which includes 31 question items. This questionnaire examines respondents&#x02019; relative identification with five distinct dimensions of emerging adulthood: identity exploration, instability, self-focused, feeling &#x0201c;in-between&#x0201d;, and possibility. One dimension, the other-focused was omitted from the analysis. This is due to the fact that this dimension does not belong to the dimension of emerging adult experiences. It was designed to contrast with the &#x0201c;self-focused&#x0201d; subscale. This research tool is scored using four points ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). Respondents indicate how much of their current life (as well as the previous few years and the next few years, as they see it) corresponds to each question item.</p><p>According to [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], the dimension of identity exploration in the experience of emerging adulthood consists of four dimensions: instability, possibility, self-focus, and feeling &#x0201c;in-between&#x0201d;. According to [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], identity exploration is an important part of the emerging adulthood experience because it encompasses all aspects of emerging adulthood experiences. Furthermore, [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] asserted that all dimensions of IDEA are positively and significantly related. As a result of the justification provided, the researcher is able to conceptualise IDEA as identity exploration in this study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Pre-test</title><p>After the questionnaire has been formulated, the researcher conducts a pre-test to critically evaluate each item before distributing the questionnaire. It is essential to conduct pre-testing to identify potential issues respondents may have understanding or defining questionnaire questions [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. A small sample of respondents is used for pre-testing to ensure that the questionnaire questions are clear and easily understood. This is done to reduce problems such as ambiguous and biassed wording, as well as to test the questionnaire&#x02019;s appropriateness in the context study [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Convenience sampling was used to select five first-year students to participate in this pre-test. The participants of this pre-test were excluded from the study sample. In addition, two academicians who are experts in the field of developmental psychology have been chosen to provide suggestions and advice for improving the quality of measurement instruments. Each respondent receives a copy of the questionnaire and is instructed to respond, identify any difficulties in understanding the questions and instructions presented on the questionnaire, and evaluate the sentence&#x02019;s relevance to the intended meaning. Following this, modifications were made: 1) Responses in Section A were refined to specify the specific field of study rather than broad fields of study; 2) Question numbering was restructured based on feedback regarding the item list&#x02019;s length; and 3) A culturally-sensitive question in Section B was realigned. The researcher identifies and reexamines every comment and suggestion made.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Data analysis</title><p>This study applies PLS-SEM to gain greater insights into the mediating effect of identity exploration on the relationship between parental trust, parental communication, peer trust, peer communication, and university adjustment. We used PLS-SEM because of its inherent suitability for exploratory studies, which could examine both the measurement and structural models [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], using the SmartPLS 3.0 [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] software package. SmartPLS is well-suited for analyzing data from small or moderate sample sizes, which can be common in social science research [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294658.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. It uses a partial least squares (PLS) algorithm, which is more robust than traditional maximum likelihood estimation methods for smaller sample sizes [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. SmartPLS is capable of analyzing complex models with multiple latent variables and observed variables [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. It can also handle non-linear relationships and interactions between variables, which can be difficult to analyze using traditional methods [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Additionally, SmartPLS is able to estimate and test complex models that include multiple mediators and non-linear relationships between variables. For example, [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] demonstrated the use of SmartPLS to estimate a mediation model with multiple mediators and non-linear relationships between variables. For the mediator analysis, the researcher employs the product of the coefficient&#x02019;s method with bootstrapping [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>].

In the analysis of direct effects as depicted in S2 Fig in <xref rid="pone.0294658.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>, the results shows that parental trust had a significant positive effect on identity exploration (<italic toggle="yes">&#x003b2;</italic> = 0.157, t = 2.162). Similarly, peer communication was found to have a positive effect on identity exploration (<italic toggle="yes">&#x003b2;</italic> = 0.157, t = 2.162). Moreover, identity exploration significantly influenced university adjustment (<italic toggle="yes">&#x003b2;</italic> = 0.433, t = 11.542). Contrastingly, parental communication&#x02019;s effect on identity exploration was not statistically significant (<italic toggle="yes">&#x003b2;</italic> = 0.055, t = 0.835). The same was true for the relationship between peer trust and identity exploration (<italic toggle="yes">&#x003b2;</italic> = 0.153, t = 1.913). In examining the mediation effects, our results highlighted the significance of indirect pathways. Specifically, parental trust had a significant indirect effect on university adjustment through identity exploration (<italic toggle="yes">&#x003b2;</italic> = 0.073, t = 1.937). Similarly, the mediating role of identity exploration in the relationship between peer communication and university adjustment was also significant (<italic toggle="yes">&#x003b2;</italic> = 0.068, t = 2.048).

GPA added as a control variable in the final model. Control variable is treated as exogenous latent variable similar to other exogenous variables in the model [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Control variable should be included for the expressed purpose of accounting for known or potential confounding effects on any construct in the model [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. GPA is often used as a measure of academic ability or preparedness. Students with higher GPAs are generally perceived to have better academic skills and knowledge, which may make them better equipped to handle the academic demands of university. Therefore, controlling for GPA in studies investigating university adjustment helps to ensure that any observed effects are not simply due to differences in academic ability or preparation. Secondly, GPA has been found to be associated with various aspects of university adjustment. For example, students with higher GPAs tend to experience less academic stress, have better study habits and time management skills, and are more likely to persist and succeed in their studies. Therefore, controlling for GPA helps to isolate the effects of other variables on university adjustment that are not simply due to differences in academic performance. In order to test for the effects of control variable in this study GPA was included in the model and linked to university adjustment. The bootstrapping was applied to see the relationship between the control variable and university adjustment. The bootstrapping result indicates GPA has insignificant relationship with university adjustment (<italic toggle="yes">&#x003b2;</italic> = 0.004, t = 0.126), suggesting that identity exploration has no change as the education level change.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec021"><title>Discussion</title><p>The transition to university brings with it a variety of life demands that can interfere with students&#x02019; adjustment to university life, particularly among first-year students. As discussed, previous research indicates that the attachment to parents and peers is an important factor that can influence adjustment during the transition to the university. This study introduces the identity exploration as a mediator in an effort to examine how first-year students utilize attachment with parents and peers to achieve identity exploration and further improve university adjustment. The study&#x02019;s findings show that identity exploration acts as a mediator in the relationship between parental trust and university adjustment, but it does not act as a mediator in the relationship between parental communication and university adjustment. In contrast, the findings indicate that identity exploration mediates the relationship between peer communication and university adjustment. However, identity exploration did not act as a mediator in the relationship between peer trust and university adjustment. This study has empirically linked attachment theory and emerging adulthood theory based on the assertions of [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. According to the findings of this study, parent and peer attachment have similar goals but serve different functions in enhancing identity exploration. Aspects of trust were found to be important in attachment relationships with parents, while communication aspects were found to be important in attachment relationships with peers.</p><p>This study provides strong support for the argument that starting university is akin to a &#x02018;strange situation&#x02019; [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294658.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Emerging adults require a primary attachment subject (parents), just like infants, to explore new environments. This study also supports [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] argument that university students who have a secure attachment relationship with their parents are better able to adjust to developmental tasks at university. The question also arises as to why the identity exploration does not act as a mediator in the relationship between the communication and adjustment subscale in university. According to [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], the behaviour of separation and reunion is evaluated to measure the level of attachment in babies; for adults, the assessment of the level of attachment is seen in terms of the cognitive-affective dimension. This study operationalised the communication sub-scale as &#x0201c;the level and quality of verbal communication with parents&#x0201d;. During the transition to college, direct communication with parents diminishes, and parents no longer constantly monitor their children. The decrease in verbal communication between students and parents makes parents unable to respond to or be sensitive to students&#x02019; emotional states, interfering with the process of student identity development. However, it should be emphasized that even if students have autonomy from their parents, this does not imply that the level of attachment is weak. According to [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], students who live away from their families during the transition period to the university world have a better attachment relationship with their parents than students who live with their parents. The results of this research support this notion, showing a strong association between trust in parents and not for communication with them. According to [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], emerging adults view trust as &#x0201c;perceived security&#x0201d; provided by the main attachment subject (parents). In this study, trust is operationally defined as &#x0201c;respect for parents and mutual trust&#x0201d;. Students maintain strong bonds by demonstrating mutual respect and trust. Mutual trust between students and parents leads to the exploration of an active and healthy environment, which leads to a good adjustment during the transition to first year at university [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294658.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. This study&#x02019;s findings support the claims that transition and adjustment at university are important developmental milestones for students because they begin their journey into emerging adulthood at this time [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294658.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. The transition to university life places a high demand on first-year students for autonomy and responsibility. A successful transition to the university environment necessitates students&#x02019; ability to manage time effectively, create a manageable academic and social schedule, complete academic tasks, consult about a new social life, and respond to new challenges and pressures [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294658.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. This period also includes an extension of the search for self-definition and identity for students in particular [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. This study also demonstrated that a close relationship between emerging adults and their parents while at university can aid in student development by providing a &#x0201c;safe base&#x0201d; that allows students to explore and build capacity in a life environment outside of the family environment, which in turn can have a positive influence on adjustment to the university in particular.</p><p>Studies of emerging adults indicate that during the transition to university, the majority of students will leave home and separate from their parents; this prompts students to seek support from peers to assist them in adjusting to this significant life change [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294658.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Attachment theory emphasizes that infants have attachment relationships with one primary subject, who is typically the mother, while children begin to develop attachment relationships with other family members such as siblings or caregivers, and at the adolescent stage and beyond, individuals begin to develop attachment relationships. a diverse group made up of people who are not family members, such as peers. Indeed, attachment theory emphasizes the importance of the quality of the attachment relationship, which is not limited to mothers, fathers, and grandparents. In fact, attachment to others is viewed as not causing any major issues or problems in emerging adults. In contrast to peers, the attachment function is more of a &#x0201c;safe haven,&#x0201d; in that it helps adults find comfort in the face of threats or fear. Although parent and peer attachment serve different functions, they both serve the same purpose: to be a factor that can assist first-year students in dealing with the transition of identity development and in adjusting to the new university environment. Peers serve as a safe haven, acting as individuals who can provide relief and assistance through the challenges of development and adjustment at university. According to [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], time spent with parents begins to decline in emerging adulthood period. Because parents are currently unable to interact face-to-face with students, peers are the closest individuals who can be used as a safe space to express concerns and opinions. According to [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], during the growing adulthood period, students tend to turn to peers in desperate situations. Aspects of good communication quality, in particular, can influence the exploration of student identity, where students can share all of their problems and concerns. This study backs up [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] claim that good communication with friends indicates the presence of secure relationships with peers, thereby supporting the importance of communication in attachment. Communication with close friends during the period of developing adulthood plays a crucial role in helping adults develop toward identity formation and, at the same time, influences adaptation in the university [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0294658.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>].</p><p>The study&#x02019;s findings indicate that the aspect of trust in parents has a significant indirect relationship with university adjustment. People dealing with university students such as lecturers, academic advisers, counsellors, and university administrators must understand that parental trust and peer communication must be emphasised in order to encourage students to actively explore the university environment. Starting university requires students to become independent, so they rarely see their families. For this reason, it is crucial that students and parents maintain a level of trust in one another so that college students can confidently explore unfamiliar environments without feeling threatened or uncertain. Additionally, first-year students spend more time with their peers as a result of their independence from their families. Thus, good communication elements must always exist between students and their peers so that students can explore new environments and then make adjustments at university. The university should have a programme that can implement bond formation with parents and peers, particularly in the area of parental trust and peer communications, so that students are more aware of the need to maintain and preserve existing good bonding relationships despite having achieved autonomy from parents. Peers, for example, must function as individuals who can provide a safe space for students to express their problems and concerns while at university. When students discuss problems, their peers must be sensitive and responsive to the opinions expressed. Peers are also encouraged to be more sensitive to things that may upset students&#x02019; emotions and to be more open in communicating about university problems. Furthermore, the study&#x02019;s findings suggest that students should be more active in discovering their identity, developing self-awareness, determining their own values and beliefs, and learning to plan for the future. Additionally, students are reminded to have an open mind and to not be afraid to try new things and experiment with different things. Students are also advised to mature gradually, to think optimistically, to be independent, to focus on themselves, to be responsible, and to discover their own abilities. Students should also be aware that the emerging adulthood experience at university can be unstable, with students experiencing confusion, limited feelings, high stress, and anxiety. This is a common side effect of active identity exploration. If the student actively engages in the suggested exploration, he or she will acquire soft skills and become a holistic graduate, that is, a person with good knowledge, morals, behaviour, mindset, and manners as a result of the university learning experience [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>].</p><p>While the current study was conducted prior to the advent of COVID-19 in 2015, its emphasis on attachment and identity for university adjustment aligns with more recent findings in the context of the pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>] investigated changes in parent and peer attachment and the associated adjustment challenges among college students in the United States. They discovered that students reported lower attachment security, which was associated with greater adjustment difficulties. Reduced peer attachment, in particular, was associated with feelings of loneliness and depression. Parental attachment, on the other hand, appeared to balance the pandemic strains. A notable finding from their study was a stronger link between lower parental attachment and feelings of loneliness among Asian American students, possibly indicating cultural differences in family interdependence.</p><p>[<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>] investigated the relationship between attachment to parents and peers, as well as the psychological consequences of the pandemic in late adolescents. Their findings highlighted the significant impact of attachment to fathers and peers, rather than mothers, on adolescent distress during COVID-19. The study also highlighted the link between high levels of alexithymia (difficulty in recognizing and expressing emotions) and emotional-behavioral difficulties. Connecting these studies to ours reveals a recurring theme: while attachment patterns influence psychological well-being and adjustment, factors such as identity (as investigated in our study) and alexithymia (as investigated in Tambelli et al.&#x02019;s research) can mediate these relationships. These mediating variables may provide additional insight into the complexities of how young adults navigate challenges, such as transitioning to university or dealing with unprecedented global events such as a pandemic. In summary, the significance of attachment and its relationships with other psychological constructs like identity continue to be vital in understanding university adjustment and overall psychological well-being, regardless of the diverse socio-historical contexts and research goals.</p><p>The implications of our study are twofold, both theoretical and practical. Theoretically, this study provides robust empirical evidence that experiences during emerging adulthood, particularly identity exploration, can mediate the relationships between parental attachment, peer attachment, and university adjustment. Building on the perspectives of [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>], our findings furnish a comprehensive conceptual framework. Further, this research establishes an empirical connection between Bowlby&#x02019;s attachment theory and Arnett&#x02019;s theory of emerging adulthood. It elucidates how these two theories intersect and influence each other. While attachment theory underscores the role of attachment in identity exploration, our results indicate that parent and peer attachment bolster identity exploration via distinct mechanisms, such as trust and communication. Moreover, this research amplifies the framework of identity by presenting it as a multifaceted construct, echoing the sentiments of [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. On the whole, this research enhances existing literature by scrutinizing the mediating role of identity exploration between parental and peer attachment and university adjustment.</p><p>The practical implications derived from our study are profound. Firstly, the importance of parental trust and peer communication in facilitating the transition for first-year college students cannot be overstated. This suggests that educational policymakers, especially within Malaysian universities, ought to prioritize the development and implementation of comprehensive transition programs that accentuate these elements. Such strategic policies could pave the way for platforms or initiatives that actively nurture the formation of supportive peer relationships. Recognizing the vital role of strong friendships and open peer communication, these initiatives would be instrumental in creating an academic atmosphere where students feel sufficiently secure to voice their concerns and challenges, thereby enhancing their overall well-being and social adjustment. Furthermore, the significant influence of parental trust on university adjustment beckons the formulation of policies that bolster parental engagement. Initiatives might encompass workshops, seminars, or even counselling sessions tailored to amplify the trust between students and their parents. With fortified trust, students are more likely to confidently embrace new roles, make independent decisions, and navigate the myriad challenges university life presents. Lastly, understanding the pivotal mediating role of identity exploration, it becomes imperative for policymakers to advocate for curricular and extracurricular platforms geared towards this end. Such avenues, offering experiences from internships to cultural immersion programs, would serve as fertile grounds for students to introspectively explore their personal, political, religious, and professional identities. In synthesizing these policy implications, it becomes evident that university governing bodies, in collaboration with educators and counselors, can enact impactful measures that promote a holistic student development, equipping them with the tools to address both academic and personal challenges head-on.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Limitations and future research</title><p>Despite the fact that the design of this study was chosen based on its suitability to address the study&#x02019;s objectives and key elements, there are still some limitations that the researcher cannot avoid. The first is related to the concept of parental attachment; in this study, respondents are asked to answer questions about the influence of parental attachment without making any distinction between mothers and fathers. According to [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>], the family environment as a whole is more important than the specific relationship with the mother or father in determining the emerging adult&#x02019;s sense of social competence. Among the studies that use a single assessment of parents is the study of [<xref rid="pone.0294658.ref101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>], who justifies this by stating that it is possible unless the respondent has a &#x0201c;very different&#x0201d; relationship with the mother and father, which requires them to assess the mother and father differently. Thus, future research can expand on this study to examine mother and father attachments separately.</p><p>Second, the study&#x02019;s limitation related to generalizability is justified by the sampling method and the specific population that was studied. While snowball sampling can be an effective way to recruit participants with specific characteristics, it can also introduce biases into the sample, leading to potential limitations in generalizing the results to other populations. Furthermore, the study was limited to first-year students at one Malaysian institution of higher education. This means that the sample may not be representative of other populations, such as students at different institutions or at different stages of their academic career. Additionally, the cultural context and educational system in Malaysia may differ from other countries, further limiting the generalizability of the results. Therefore, while the findings of the study may be informative and relevant for the specific population and context that was studied, caution should be taken when attempting to generalize the results to other populations or contexts. Nevertheless, the findings of this study as a whole provide new and profound insight and understanding of parental and peer attachment, identity exploration, and university adjustment in the context of first-year students. The researcher believes that assessing this research model from a global perspective by comparing countries and cultural contexts would make this study more interesting. Furthermore, the sample can be drawn by distinguishing the year of study and not limiting the study to first-year students. Previous research has demonstrated that adjustment at university can differ depending on the year of study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec023"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of this study demonstrate that the attachment theory and the emerging adulthood theory each have their own unique connections during the emerging adulthood period. This study investigates the relationship between parental and peer attachment in the context of the transition to first-year university, as well as the benefits of identity exploration for first-year students. The study discovered that identity exploration serves as a mediator between parental trust and university adjustment, as well as between peer communication and university adjustment. In conclusion, those who work with university students in particular should be able to identify how factors like parental attachment can influence a successful transition to university life. People who work with emerging adults must also recognize the context of identity exploration, which can influence the relationship between attachment and adjustment during the transition to university life. Furthermore, this study found that relationships with peers are just as important as those with parents, though they can impact adjustment in different ways. Overall, the results of this study lend credence to the notion that first-year students&#x02019; attachment to both family and friends plays a crucial role in the success of their transition to university life.</p></sec><sec id="sec024" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0294658.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>STROBE statement&#x02014;checklist of items that should be included in reports of observational studies.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0294658.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0294658.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 File</label><caption><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0294658.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0294658.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Almukhambetova</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hern&#x000e1;ndez-Torrano</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name>. <article-title>Gifted students&#x02019; adjustment and underachievement in university: An exploration from the self-determination theory perspective</article-title>. <source>Gifted Child Quarterly</source>. <year>2020</year>;<volume>64</volume>(<issue>2</issue>):<fpage>117</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>31</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0294658.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Malau-Aduli</surname><given-names>BS</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Adu</surname><given-names>MD</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Alele</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Drovandi</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Mylrea</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>. <article-title>Adjusting to university: Perceptions of first-year health professions students</article-title>. <source>PloS one</source>. <year>2021</year>;<volume>16</volume>(<issue>5</issue>):<fpage>e0251634</fpage>. <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0251634</pub-id>

I recommend the authors use the following subheadings to present the information:</p><p>1. Study design</p><p>2. Study setting</p><p>3. Sample and participant recruitment</p><p>Table 1: which faculty/school within the university where these participants drawn from? Literature has shown students experiences differs across faculties and schools.</p><p>Instruments:</p><p>&#x0201c;Section A consisted of questions about sociodemographic profiles, such as gender, age, 250 highest level of education, and ethnic group&#x02026;&#x0201d; It is unclear what are you referring to?

No doubt, these are mature and most likely academics/scholars. I have just a couple of suggestions: the authors must remember that the journal is international and so is their audience.

Method:</p><p>The section can be better presented. I struggled to identify information related to the study design, study setting, and participant sampling strategy. Also, information related to the number of students invited to complete the survey, response rate, complete and incomplete responses is insufficient. I recommend the authors use the following subheadings to present the information:</p><p>1. Study design</p><p>2. Study setting</p><p>3. Sample and participant recruitment</p><p>Table 1: which faculty/school within the university where these participants drawn from? Literature has shown students experiences differs across faculties and schools.</p><p>Answers:</p><p>- Thank you for your feedback. We've revised the method section to clearly include:</p><p>1. Study Design</p><p>2. Study Setting</p><p>3. Sample and Participant Recruitment</p><p>- Thank you for your query. In our study, we only collected data on the field of study and not the specific faculty or school within the university. We have included the information. Please refer to line 277.</p><p>- Details on the number of invited students, response rate, and complete/incomplete responses have also been added. Please refer to line 229-235.</p><p>Instruments:</p><p>&#x0201c;Section A consisted of questions about sociodemographic profiles, such as gender, age, 250 highest level of education, and ethnic group&#x02026;&#x0201d; It is unclear what are you referring to? I suggest you have a section where you clearly outline the different sections of the survey, and present the participant demographic data as part of the results, so the reader can easily make sense of the survey sections and interpretation. &#x0201d;</p><p>- Thank you for your feedback. We've revised the "Instruments" section to clearly outline the different sections of the survey. Please refer to line 258.</p><p>- In addition, we have moved the participant demographic data to the results for better clarity and understanding. Please refer to line 350-372.</p><p>Pre-test:</p><p>What were the results or feedback from the students and academics? </p><p>Answer: We have included the feedback of students and academics. Please refer to line 325-328.</p><p>3. Results and discussions:</p><p>The authors performed relevant tests, however the order is vague, particularly the interpretation. It is difficult is identify what where the key results for each of the studied variables. The discussion is elaborative, however old sources are cited (e.g. Aries &#x00026; Johnson, 1983; Collins and Repinski (1994); Fraley &#x00026; Davis, 1997; Kenny, 1987). I recommend the authors attempt to cite recent articles. </p><p>Answers:</p><p>- Thank you for the feedback. We've restructured the results section to sequentially outline the tests performed and to explicitly highlight the key findings for each studied variable. Please refer to 374-434.</p><p>- Thank you for the feedback. We reviewed the literature and incorporated more recent articles to ensure the discussion was current and relevant.</p><p>4. I have noted data was collected in 2015, since then we have had COVID-19 which negatively affected universities and students' wellbeing across the world. Few studies have since been published, consider interrogating some of these studies, particularly those in line with your results. </p><p>Answers:</p><p>- Thank you for the feedback. We have revised the manuscript to incorporate recent literature, especially those addressing the impacts of COVID-19 on universities and students' wellbeing. Please refer to line 574-597.</p><p>5. Theoretical and practical contributions:</p><p>The contributions of the study are best covered as part of the discussion including policy implications. </p><p>Answers:</p><p>- Thank you for the suggestion. We have revised the section to integrate the theoretical and practical contributions within the discussion. Please refer to line 598-632.</p><p>#Reviewer 2</p><p>1. Worth mentioning is that my research niches and the theoretical framework that I use are not clinical, quantitative research and psychology. I'm more into community development and related fields of practice. Nonetheless, I found this paper to have been excellently conceptualized, with logical themes that align the title, the aim, objectives, theoretical frameworks and methodology together. No doubt, these are mature and most likely academics/scholars. I have just a couple of suggestions: the authors must remember that the journal is international and so is their audience. As such the readers need context in respect some abbreviations and standards. </p><p>Answer: Thank you for your valuable feedback and kind words regarding the paper's conceptualization and alignment. We appreciate the perspective you've provided from the community development field. Taking note of your suggestions, we have revised the manuscript to provide clearer context for abbreviations and standards to cater to our international audience.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="pone.0294658.r003" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0294658.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dube</surname><given-names>Nkosiyazi</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2023 Nkosiyazi Dube</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2023</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Nkosiyazi Dube</copyright-holder><license><ali:license_ref xmlns:ali="http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/" specific-use="textmining" content-type="ccbylicense">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</ali:license_ref><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0294658" id="rel-obj003" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
