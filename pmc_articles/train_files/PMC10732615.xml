However, genetic polymorphisms can influence DNAm levels resulting in methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTL). These can be either direct effects, by altering the sequence of the methylation (CpG) site itself, or, in the case of array-based measures, indirectly altering the detection probe-binding site interaction. Given that genetic variant frequencies associated with meQTL can differ between population groups, these have the potential to confound EWAS observations, particularly in multi-ethnic populations. In this study, we analysed publicly available DNA methylation profiles (<italic toggle="yes">450K array</italic>), consisting of 1342 individuals from 6 distinct ancestral groups. We investigate two distinct tools (<italic toggle="yes">GapHunter</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MethylToSNP)</italic> specifically designed to identify CpG sites that may be influenced by genetic variation. Results from this aggregated trans-ancestral epigenome-wide dataset suggest that both tools fail to consistently identify not only rarer (MAF &#x0003c; 0.05) genetic variant effects but also more than half of sites predicted to be associated with variants with much higher allele frequencies (MAF &#x0003e;0.2). In addition, there is a relatively low concordance in the detection of polymorphic CpGs between <italic toggle="yes">GapHunter</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MethylToSNP</italic>. Screening of CpG site associations from EWAS using either of these tools is unlikely to be a robust or comprehensive means of identifying all genetic variant confounding effects.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>Epigenetics</kwd><kwd>EWAS</kwd><kwd>CpGs polymorphism</kwd><kwd>probe polymorphism</kwd><kwd>genetic polymorphism</kwd><kwd>EWAS trans-ancestry</kwd></kwd-group><support-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>

The most commonly investigated epigenetic mechanism being DNAm forming 5-methylcytosine (5-mC), due to its alteration by environmental exposures, relative stability, and ability to alter gene expression. As such, changes in specific 5-mC DNAm (CpG) sites have been proposed as useful biomarkers to study environmental influences on biological processes and pathobiology [<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>The Illumina Human Methylation EPIC and 450K arrays have provided the most accessible platform to study genome-wide DNA methylation in humans [<xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These arrays cover approximately 99% of the genes in the RefSeq database and are considered to provide robust and accurate assessment of methylation levels in genic and intergenic regions. It is important to note that the assessment of DNAm using these arrays can be influenced by genetic variation [<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Genetic variation can occur at or near CpG sites, which can either directly ablate the methylation site or influence the binding efficiency or specificity of the probes used in these assays. This can result in misleading DNAm values being reported. Although lists of CpG sites that are potentially prone to these problems are publicly available, these are problematic. For example, they could be used to exclude potentially polymorphic sites, but factors such as population variable allele frequencies, and, in the case of probe-binding region SNPs, variable effects make this difficult and run the risk of over excluding potentially epigenetically relevant sites. It is more preferable to directly screen DNAm results for patterns suggestive of genetic effects, especially in populations in which genetic variation is not as well mapped as in Europeans.</p><p>Here, we report our findings regarding the detection of genetic polymorphic effects on DNAm levels assessed using Illumina microarrays. Currently, the most widely used tools for this purpose, as reported in the literature, are <italic toggle="yes">GapHunter</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MethylToSNP</italic> [<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These are based on the premise that a polymorphic CpG site returns three discrete levels of DNAm, (1) full methylation would correspond with both allelic copies of the CpG site being intact, (2) partial methylation would correspond to a heterozygote single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at either the cytosine or guanine nucleotide of the CpG site or (3) the effective absence of methylation due to being homozygotic for a CpG altering SNP. In these cases, &#x003b2;-values will tend to cluster into three discrete levels, with gaps in between, when the methylation levels (&#x003b2;-values) from different individuals are plotted together (<xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). The effects of SNPs located in the probe-binding regions are more subtle and need to be considered separately to that of CpG site SNPs. Here, we evaluate the efficiency of existing methods for the identification of apparent polymorphic effects on CpG site &#x003b2;-values generated using Illumina microarrays in ethnically diverse populations.

Subsequently, we plotted the &#x003b2;-value distributions for these 48 sites and observed that they each formed three distinct cluster patterns (as described above, <xref rid="f0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). While over 80% (40/48) of sites had most of their values in the upper cluster, likely suggesting that the lower two clusters were associated with SNP minor alleles, which resulted in CpG ablation, a minority (8 sites) had an inverse effect. In these eight sites (shown by red arrows in <xref rid="f0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>) a majority of samples were associated with the lower (near zero) &#x003b2;-value cluster, with the upper two clusters therefore likely being explained by an SNP creating a CpG site in those individuals. Similar effects for these eight sites were observed in the Simons Genome Diversity Project (SGDP) [<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

To investigate this further, we conducted a thorough examination of the &#x003b2;-value distributions for all 4033 potentially polymorphic CpGs identified by GapHunter. For this analysis, potential meQTLs were stratified based on the known allele frequencies of the predicted associated SNP. As with the previous analysis, we were unable to observe patterns suggestive of polymorphic hypomethylated sites (Supplementary Figure S1). As a sensitivity analysis, we also adjusted for study participant age and sex, and where able to confirm that the observed potential meQTL &#x003b2;-value distributions where no substantivity is confounded by these factors (Supplementary Figure S2).</p><p>We suggest that the absence of detection of potentially polymorphic hypomethylated sites may be due to the methodology used by these tools. Firstly, MethylToSNP detects clusters based on a set of predetermined thresholds for methylation levels [<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. As such, this essentially excludes the possibility of identifying hypomethylated polymorphic CpGs. Secondly, GapHunter aims to identify discrete clusters of &#x003b2;-values by detecting &#x02018;gaps&#x02019; between them. These &#x02018;gaps&#x02019; will be compressed together, and therefore more difficult to discretely resolve, in CpG sites in which the mean &#x003b2;-values (of an intact CpG site) are less than 0.5.</p><p>To estimate the likely efficiency of both tools to identify polymorphic CpGs associated with SNPs of differing MAFs, we examined <italic toggle="yes">GapHunter</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">MethylToSNP</italic> predictions and compared them to the reported allele frequency of the associated SNP (<xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Across all stratified MAF groups, we observed a very low concordance between the predicted polymorphic CpGs identified by <italic toggle="yes">MethylToSNP</italic> (<xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). In contrast, <italic toggle="yes">GapHunter</italic> showed a stronger relationship between the rate of polymorphic site detection and MAF. At the CpG sites containing SNPs with MAF&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.20 <italic toggle="yes">GapHunter</italic> identified 40% to 50% of the sites as being polymorphic (<xref rid="f0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). This rate appeared to fall in a linear fashion when the MAF was below 0.2. With rare SNPs (MAF &#x0003c; 0.02) <italic toggle="yes">MethylToSNP</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">GapHunter</italic> both identified only 1% of the predicted polymorphic sites.

Of concern, we observed numerous examples of unflagged CpG sites that had 3-cluster distributions, whose sample distributions between each cluster were generally consistent with Hardy &#x02013; Weinberg equilibrium predictions, further supporting the suggestion of a polymorphic effect. Supplementary Figure S3 illustrates numerous examples of polymorphic CpGs showing three distinct clusters of methylation levels but which were not flagged as potential meQTLs by GapHunter. These findings suggest that GapHunter may not be sensitive enough to detect all polymorphic CpG sites, especially those with lower MAF. In particular, with rare SNPs (MAF &#x0003c; 0.02), both tools only identified a very small percentage of the predicted potentially polymorphic sites, which raises concerns about their accuracy and reliability in detecting DNA methylation effects due to such rare polymorphisms.</p><p>In array-based DNAm studies, it is important to consider not only CpGs polymorphism but also the potential influence of probe-specific polymorphic sites. Probe site polymorphisms refer to genetic variations occurring within specific probe-binding regions. These variations can include SNPs or other genomic variations that could impact upon binding efficiency or stability of the probe&#x02013;DNA interaction. The potential for such effects to alter the interpretation of differential DNAm analysis in EWAS is of substantial concern because, in contrast to CpG site SNPs, these variants may result in smaller percentage changes to the reported &#x003b2;-values. As shown in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>, in which two separate examples of probe SNPs (rs4590707 and rs12129193) are shown that appear to influence the CpG site reported &#x003b2;-values but do not consistently result in detectable &#x02018;gaps&#x02019; between signal clusters [<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Without access to genotype information, distinguishing these signals from true associations represents a considerable challenge.

Many researchers choose to exclude all polymorphic sites from their analysis to avoid potential confounding effects on their results. However, this approach will substantially reduce the number of sites being analysed. To avoid this loss of detection power, researchers may choose to selectively exclude polymorphic sites that are likely to have a strong impact on the results, while retaining those that are less likely to be confounding. For example, one approach is to exclude CpGs associated with SNPs with a minor allele frequency above a certain threshold. While this may retain sites that are less likely to be impacted by a polymorphic effect, it is difficult to be sure that the strategy will be consistent across different ancestry sub-groups. Another approach is to use statistical methods that are robust to measurement error or that explicitly model the effect of genetic variation on DNAm. However, such methods should be both sensitive and specific to ensure that only true polymorphic sites are identified and to avoid false positives or false negatives.</p><p>In order to evaluate GapHunter&#x02019;s performance for the identification of probe SNPs (as distinct from CpG site SNPs), we performed a comparative analysis by juxtaposing the results obtained from GapHunter with a list of potentially polymorphic probe sites reported by Illumina. We specifically focus on the identification of common SNPs, which are more likely to have a confounding effect in EWAS. To achieve this, we selected a subset from Illumina&#x02019;s list consisting of 25,877 potential probe site SNPs with a MAF&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.1. From this subset, GapHunter identified 1305 potential meQTLs, which is only 5% of the predicted SNP variable sites. Interestingly, in this multi-ethnic study, GapHunter failed to detect the likely polymorphic nature of certain sites, even when distinct gaps were present in a particular population (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref>). These findings suggest the need for a thorough evaluation of GapHunter&#x02019;s effectiveness in accurately capturing all genetically intricate sites.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" id="s0004"><title>Future directions</title><p>Based on our observations, there is a clear need to develop more resilient and precise tools to accurately detect genetic variant confounding of DNAm observations. This is proving to be a formidable challenge which, even with refinements, may be beyond the capacity of current tools. Future tools will need to have the ability to accommodate a wide spectrum of allele frequencies and methylation patterns, including hypomethylated sites. In the interim, we would suggest that researchers consider careful integration of their DNAm data with appropriate genotype reference data. This integration can help flag potential associations between known genetic variations and DNA methylation levels, however, this may not address issues of cryptic meQTL in less well genetically characterized populations. The future most likely lies in approaches utilizing machine learning algorithms, to identify DNAm patterns suggestive of genetic variant effects. Such algorithms will need to be carefully trained on genetically diverse datasets to improve their accuracy in detecting polymorphic CpG sites and SNP effects within probe-binding regions.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" id="s0005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>There is no doubt that polymorphic CpGs can confound downstream methylation analysis, with the presence of genetic variations leading to spurious associations between DNA methylation levels and the phenotype of interest. In addition, if a polymorphic CpG is associated with a disease phenotype, but its methylation state is also associated with genetic variation at that site, it may be difficult to determine whether the association is directly associated with differential methylation or is acting as an indirect surrogate of a genetic effect [<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It is important to note that, polymorphic CpGs can vary in frequency across different populations; therefore, studies that aim to compare DNAm levels across ancestrally diverse populations should be particularly careful to investigate the potential influence of polymorphic CpGs on their analysis and interpretation. Moreover, these findings suggest that there may also be limitations in the current methods with regard to identifying hypomethylated polymorphic CpGs and SNP effects within probe-binding regions.</p><p>In conclusion, while tools such as GapHunter manage to find a proportion of meQTLs, our analysis suggests that many genetically confounded sites will escape identification. Therefore, a thorough interrogation of EWAS top hits also needs to be performed for the comprehensive identification of potentially genetically confounded CpG sites.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="SM9092" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplementary Figure 2.jpg</title></caption><media xlink:href="KEPI_A_2281153_SM9092.jpg"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SM9091" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplementary_File_3.docx</title></caption><media xlink:href="KEPI_A_2281153_SM9091.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SM9089" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplementary_File_2.docx</title></caption><media xlink:href="KEPI_A_2281153_SM9089.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SM9088" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplementary_File_1.docx</title></caption><media xlink:href="KEPI_A_2281153_SM9088.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SM9087" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplementary Figure 1.jpg</title></caption><media xlink:href="KEPI_A_2281153_SM9087.jpg"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="SM9086" position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplementary Figure 3.jpeg</title></caption><media xlink:href="KEPI_A_2281153_SM9086.jpeg"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="COI-statement" disp-level="1" id="s0006"><title>Disclosure statement</title><p>No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" disp-level="1" id="s0007"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>Publicly available datasets from the NCBI GEO database were utilized in this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" disp-level="1" id="s0008"><title>Supplementary material</title><p>Supplemental data for this article can be accessed online at <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15592294.2023.2281153" ext-link-type="uri">https://doi.org/10.1080/15592294.2023.2281153</ext-link></p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="cit0001"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><string-name><surname>Schulz</surname>
