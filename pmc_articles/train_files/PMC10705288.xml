To overcome this limit, we developed a compact, portable reprogramming system that increases direct conversion of fibroblasts to motor neurons by two orders of magnitude. We show that subpopulations with different reprogramming potentials are distinguishable by proliferation history. By controlling for proliferation history and titrating each transcription factor, we find that conversion correlates with levels of the pioneer transcription factor Ngn2, whereas conversion shows a biphasic response to Lhx3. Increasing the proliferation rate of adult human fibroblasts generates morphologically mature, induced motor neurons at high rates.

However, within these diverse cocktails, how the individual transcription factors and their stoichiometries influence reprogramming events remains poorly defined (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">An et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Carey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Ieda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Kempf et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">Velychko et al., 2019</xref>, <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; <xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">Wang Li et al., 2015</xref>). Extrinsic variation including variability across batches of cells, complex cocktails of transcription factors, and expression of those factors, as well as intrinsic cellular variation have obscured how the levels of individual transcription factors promote or impede reprogramming (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Jain et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Process variability combined with low rates of reprogramming constrain our ability to resolve the distinct molecular states and processes that cells adopt during successful reprogramming (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Ilia et al., 2023</xref>). By improving the rate of reprogramming, we can identify these states and processes that promote cell-fate transitions.</p><p id="P6">Across diverse systems, previous work has established that higher expression of reprogramming factors correlates with higher rates of reprogramming (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Babos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Ilia et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Jindal et al., 2023</xref>). However, inclusion or dropout of individual transcription factors influences the number of reprogramming events, transcriptional trajectories, and function of reprogrammed cells (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Hersbach et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Mall et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">Velychko et al., 2019</xref>). While transcriptional profiling identifies expression trajectories, transcription factors exert their influence as proteins, which cannot be directly imputed from mRNA expression (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Hafner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Ideker et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Lundberg et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, global processes such as transcription, replication, and proliferation strongly influence reprogramming events and may amplify or dampen the expression and activity of transcription factors (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Babos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Jain et al., 2023</xref>; <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Kueh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Palozola et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Percharde et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">Stadhouders et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, transcription factors are a powerful driver of cellular reprogramming but how they combine with other global processes to guide cell-fate transitions remains unclear.</p><p id="P7">During development, progenitor cells often divide prior to differentiation (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Bowman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Bultje et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Eriksson et al., 1998</xref>). Division supports differentiation and maintenance of the progenitor pool as cells adopt distinct fates. In direct conversion, cells do not necessarily transit through a defined progenitor state (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Son et al., 2011</xref>) and proliferation is not required for reprogramming (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Di Tullio and Graf, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Fishman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Heinrich et al., 2010</xref>). However, highly proliferative cells reprogram at higher rates to both induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and to post-mitotic neurons, suggesting that proliferation may serve a conserved role in facilitating cell-fate transitions (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Babos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Jain et al., 2023</xref>). Curiously, we and others have observed that the rate of proliferation can substantially impact the expression of transcription factors in both native and synthetic systems (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Babos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Kueh et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, in differentiation to macrophages, cell-cycle lengthening enables progenitors to commit to the macrophage lineage by increasing accumulation of PU.1 protein without increasing PU.1 transcription (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Kueh et al., 2013</xref>). If higher rates of proliferation simultaneously increase the probability of reprogramming and reduce expression of the transcription factors, how do cells integrate these incoherent cues?</p><p id="P8">To examine how individual transcription factors and their levels of expression contribute to reprogramming outcomes, we selected a model of direct conversion from fibroblasts to motor neurons (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Babos et al., 2019</xref>). Direct conversion to motor neurons provides a well-defined testbed with established murine transgenic reporters for staging the reprogramming process in living cells. Importantly, direct conversion to a post-mitotic identity provides several advantages over reprogramming to iPSCs. Conversion to a post-mitotic cell type such as motor neurons allows us to decouple transient changes in proliferation that facilitate cell-fate transitions from proliferation associated with the new cell identity. Further, we can accurately estimate reprogramming events based simply on the number of neurons generated which is not possible in reprogramming to iPSCs. Unlike iPSCs, neurons do not divide once reprogrammed. Thus, each neuron corresponds to exactly one reprogramming event.</p><p id="P9">While post-mitotic neurons are useful for quantifying reprogramming events, direct conversion protocols to non-proliferative cell fates often suffer from low reprogramming yields. To better dissect how transcription factor levels direct cell-fate transitions, we addressed the challenge of low reprogramming rates by capitalizing on our recently developed chemo-genetic cocktail that increases direct conversion to motor neurons by two orders of magnitude (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Babos et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, we first sought to reduce sources of extrinsic variation to resolve how individual transcription factors influence reprogramming outcomes. To this end, we tailored the transcription factor cocktail and minimized the number of viruses, consequently increasing the fraction of cells that undergo a period of rapid proliferation. These cells with a hyperproliferative history reprogram at five-fold higher rates than non-hyperproliferative cells, leading to an exponential increase in yield. By increasing the number of reprogramming events and titrating expression, we identified transcription factor-specific correlations between expression and reprogramming events. Using these insights, we designed improved reprogramming cocktails for direct conversion of adult human fibroblasts to motor neurons. To demonstrate translational potential, we developed minimal vector systems that generate motor neuron grafts capable of integrating with the murine central nervous system. Overall, our results show that proliferation history and transcription factor expression combine to drive cell-fate transitions.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3"><title>Tailored conversion cocktail minimizes extrinsic variation and increases reprogramming events</title><p id="P10">We aimed to minimize sources of extrinsic variation so we could precisely dissect the processes that support cell-fate transitions. Capitalizing on our recently developed high-efficiency cocktail (DDRR) (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Babos et al., 2019</xref>), we used the conversion of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to induced motor neurons (iMNs) as our model system. We delivered the reprogramming factors encoded on retroviruses to transgenic MEFs bearing the motor neuron reporter, Hb9::GFP (<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">Wichterle et al., 2002</xref>), which allows us to monitor reprogramming dynamically. Activation of Hb9::GFP and neuronal morphology provide live metrics of the conversion process (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">B</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A</xref>). Importantly, each fully reprogrammed induced motor neuron corresponds to exactly one reprogramming event, allowing us to quantitatively evaluate how perturbations impact the number of successful events.</p><p id="P11">While our previously published protocol improved rates of direct conversion, we observed substantial variability across biological replicates (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Babos et al., 2019</xref>). We suspected the variability in reprogramming rate was due to extrinsic variation introduced by cotransduction of eight different viruses. To reduce extrinsic variation and improve the controllability, we minimized the number of transcription factors and viruses. First, we sought to identify the minimal set of transcription factors from the originally identified six factors (6F: Ascl1, Brn2, Myt1l, Ngn2, Isl1, and Lhx3) with our previously identified high-efficiency cocktail (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Babos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Son et al., 2011</xref>). Induction of Ngn2, Isl1, and Lhx3 expression efficiently drives mouse embryonic stem cells to motor neurons (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Mazzoni et al., 2013</xref>). Further, Ngn2, Isl1, and Lhx3 (NIL) can be expressed from a single-transcript cassette where each transcription factor is separated by &#x0201c;self-cleaving&#x0201d; 2A sequences (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Mazzoni et al., 2013</xref>). As a 3.2 kilobase cargo, these three transcription factors can be efficiently delivered by a single retrovirus to induce reprogramming (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). We verified that Ngn2, Isl1, and Lhx3 together comprise a minimally sufficient set for high-efficiency MEF-to-iMN direct conversion through a transcription factor dropout experiment (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S1B</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">C</xref>). Surprisingly, NIL accelerated the number of Hb9::GFP positive cells that formed beginning at 4 days post-infection (4 dpi) compared to 6F with the high-efficiency DDRR cocktail (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>).</p><p id="P12">Next, we encoded the transgenes in the high-efficiency DDRR module into a single viral cargo. We explored how the placement of p53DD and HRAS<sup>G12V</sup> relative to an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) impacts the rate of conversion. To capture multiple dimensions of the reprogramming process, we quantified reprogramming rates using two metrics: yield and purity. We define yield as how many reprogrammed cells are at the final time point relative to the starting cell input. Yield increases for highly proliferative conditions and measures how many successful reprogramming events occur from an initial seeded population. We also define purity as the percent of cells of the total population that is reprogrammed at that time point. Purity measures the proportion of the cells that have converted into the desired cell fate. Overexpressing the DDRR module variants with the NIL reprogramming module, we observed similar reprogramming purities. However, the yield doubles for the RIDD construct where HRAS<sup>G12V</sup> is placed upstream, compared to when the DDIR construct where p53DD is upstream (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p><p id="P13">With our optimal DDRR design (RIDD), we returned to our reprogramming transcription factor module and compared the 6F cocktail with the single polycistronic cargo, NIL. Compared to 6F, NIL increases the reprogramming yield 30-fold and purity 4-fold (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">E</xref>). Having identified a highly efficient and minimal set of genetic cargoes, we used the optimal RIDD design for the high-efficiency DDRR module to systematically examine how individual transcription factors impact reprogramming. We began with examining the basis for higher reprogramming efficiency with NIL over 6F. By reducing extrinsic sources of variability, we developed a highly robust process for the direct conversion of fibroblasts to post-mitotic motor neurons, providing us a tool to systematically interrogate how transcription factor levels correlate to reprogramming events.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Proliferation history provides a principal axis to distinguish transcription factors&#x02019; influence</title><p id="P14">Hyperproliferative cells reprogram at higher rates to both mitotic and post-mitotic identities, establishing hyperproliferation as a powerful driver of diverse cell-fate transitions (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Babos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Jain et al., 2023</xref>). Potentially, different conversion rates induced by different transcription factor cocktails can be attributed to cells integrating a differential set of molecular interactions that lead to different rates of proliferation.</p><p id="P15">To examine whether differences in proliferation rates might distinguish cocktails&#x02019; reprogramming rates, we measured the proliferation history of cells undergoing reprogramming in the presence of different reprogramming cocktails. Cells that undergo a period of hyperproliferation were identified by assaying dilution of CellTrace dye for 72 hours from 1 to 4 dpi, an early timepoint in iMN direct conversion, as previously established (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Babos et al., 2019</xref>) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). We denote cells with a history of rapid proliferation at 4 dpi as hyperproliferative (hyperP) and all other cells at 4 dpi as non-hyperP. We quantify hyperproliferation by both the percent of cells in the population that are hyperproliferative and the total number of hyperproliferative cells. As expected, the fraction and total number of hyperproliferative cells scale exponentially (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2H</xref>). In addition, as we expect from its higher reprogramming efficiency, NIL + DDRR has a higher fraction and number of hyperproliferative cells than 6F + DDRR (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2A</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">B</xref>).</p><p id="P16">To examine the rates of conversion for cells with different proliferation histories, we isolated and replated the hyperproliferative and non-hyperproliferative cells at 4 dpi, and measured conversion at 14 dpi (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2C</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">D</xref>). Compared to non-hyperproliferative cells, hyperproliferative cells reprogrammed with NIL + DDRR were 25-fold more likely to express Hb9::GFP early on at 4 dpi (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), and achieve higher reprogramming yield and purity (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2E</xref>). By normalizing yield to the number of cells replated at 4 dpi, we can observe the propensity of cells to convert based on proliferation history. A history of early hyperproliferation increases the probability of cells successfully converting by 4-fold in NIL+ DDRR. Further, compared to non-hyperproliferative cells, hyperproliferative cells adopted a more mature, neuronal morphology at 14 dpi, displaying compact, regular soma with interconnected networks of axons (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2D</xref>). Taken together, these data show that hyperproliferation not only generates more cells, but also the cells generated during hyperproliferation possess a greater propensity to reprogram and develop mature morphologies.</p><p id="P17">We hypothesized that specific DDRR cassette designs may increase the rate of proliferation and thus the rates of early Hb9::GFP activation and of reprogramming (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>). As expected, increased numbers of hyperproliferative cells yields higher numbers of Hb9::GFP cells at 4 and 14 dpi (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2F</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">G</xref>). Curiously, the fraction of Hb9::GFP positive cells at 14 dpi remains unchanged across DDRR variants (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2G</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">H</xref>). Putatively, the encoding of p53DD and HRAS<sup>G12V</sup> generates different reprogramming rates due to their effects on proliferation.</p><p id="P18">We wondered whether increased rates of hyperproliferation in NIL compared to 6F coincide with a more rapid adoption of the iMN cell fate. To assess the dynamics of reprogramming events, we tracked Hb9::GFP expression over the reprogramming process. When DDRR is included with either the NIL or 6F cocktails, Hb9::GFP activation begins at 4 dpi (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). For 6F + DDRR, the number and fraction of Hb9::GFP positive cells plateaus around 5 dpi. Thus, most conversion events occur early with 6F + DDRR (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). In contrast, cells reprogrammed with NIL + DDRR continue to generate Hb9::GFP positive cells throughout the reprogramming process. We confirmed that adding DDRR to the base NIL cocktail induces a transient window of hyperproliferation by immunofluorescent staining of Ki67, a marker of proliferation (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2I</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">L</xref>). By 14 dpi, with or without DDRR, the majority of Hb9::GFP positive cells do not express Ki67, indicating they have exited cell cycle and adopted a post-mitotic identity (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2K</xref>,<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">M</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">N</xref>). Expanding the conversion window not only increases the number of cells but increases the fraction of cells that fully reprogram (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2F</xref>). Altogether, our data suggests a model in which driving proliferation provides an exponential benefit in the conversion to induced motor neurons. Proliferation not only expands the number of cells but also endows this expanded population with a greater propensity to reprogram.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Transcription factor identity and encoding impact conversion rates and dynamics</title><p id="P19">As transcription factors can work synergistically, we wondered if differences in reprogramming rates between the 6F and NIL cocktails were due to a single or multiple transcription factors. Given that the 6F cocktail reduces proliferation more than NIL in the presence of the high-efficiency DDRR module (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2A</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">B</xref>), we hypothesized that one or multiple of the three BAM (Brn2, Asl1, Myt1L) transcription factors may impede proliferation. Using the polycistronic NIL with the high-efficiency DDRR cocktail as the reference, we added in all six possible combinations of the three BAM factors to assess their individual and combined effects on proliferation and reprogramming. Inclusion of Brn2 reduces proliferation, activation of Hb9::GFP at 4 dpi, and conversion yield and purity (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2G</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">I</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S2O</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Q</xref>). In contrast, addition of Ascl1 and Myt1l increases iMN yield without altering proliferation (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref>, <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2P</xref>). Together, these data suggest that individual transcription factors can independently or synergistically influence proliferation and reprogramming.</p><p id="P20">Notably, the encoding of the TF cocktail, not just the identity of the constituents, impacts reprogramming. The cocktails of 6F and NIL + BAM contain an identical set of transcription factors. However, in 6F, Ngn2, Isl1, and Lhx3 are expressed from separate viruses whereas NIL expresses the same factors from a single transcript. The NIL + BAM cocktail reprograms with 7-fold higher purity and 12-fold higher yield while minimally impacting proliferation (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2I</xref>). These data suggest that transcription factor encoding can substantially improve (or hinder) cocktail efficacy. Putatively, the single transcript design may improve efficacy by controlling for co-delivery and stoichiometry and/or by reducing the number of viruses. Together, these observations demonstrate that while the identity of the transcription factors strongly influences reprogramming, the encoding and delivery of those factors impact the frequency and likelihood of a reprogramming event. With that in mind, we sought to determine how each of the three motor neuron transcription factors (Ngn2, Isl1, and Lhx3) influences the number of induced motor neurons.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Titration of individual transcription factors reveals factor-specific influence on conversion rates</title><p id="P21">To investigate how the levels of ectopic transcription factor expression influence reprogramming, we titrated individual transcription factors, keeping the other genetic cargos constant (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">B</xref>). We used arrays of small upstream open reading frames (uORFs) to generate a range of individual transcription factor levels while keeping the retroviral delivery vehicle the same. uORFs change gene expression by altering translation rates (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Ferreira et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2020</xref>). By adding a fluorescent 2A-mRuby2 tag downstream of the transcription factor (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), we built single-cell, live reporters of ectopic transcription factor levels. The mRuby2 levels provide a proxy for the ectopic expression of the linked transcription factor early in the reprogramming process at 4 dpi. Using these tools, we titrated the level of each transcription factor while keeping other factors and the high-efficiency DDRR module constant.</p><p id="P22">Consistent with our previous observations, the expression of each of the three transcription factor-2A-mRuby2 transgenes are lower in cells that undergo a period of hyperproliferation compared to cells that do not (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). Because we found hyperproliferative cells are 25-fold more likely to activate Hb9::GFP early and 4-fold more likely to convert to morphologically mature, motor neurons (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">E</xref>), we chose to examine the transgene expression within this population of hyperproliferative cells.

Importantly, systematically changing transcription factor expression in our tailored reprogramming module does not affect proliferation rates (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3A</xref>). Thus, our designs remove differences in proliferation history as a confounding variable across the genetic variants.

Comparing all three transcription factor reporters as controls for each other, reprogramming potential does not simply correlate with high expression of the mRuby2 reporter, suggesting the transcription factor identity sets the relationship between expression and reprograming. The positive correlation of reprogramming yield with expression of the pioneer factor, Ngn2<sup>&#x000d7;3HA</sup>, mirrors observations from iPSC reprogramming where high expression of the pioneer factor, Oct4, increases the rate of colony formation (<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">Velychko et al., 2019</xref>).

Surprisingly, we find that ectopic Lhx3 induces a biphasic response in reprogramming yield (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). In the absence of ectopic Lhx3, conversion rates are low. However, high expression of ectopic Lhx3 decreases reprogramming yield, demonstrating a biphasic reprogramming response to Lhx3. Putatively, moderate levels of Lhx3 expression support optimal reprogramming. Together, our data suggest that in the presence of Isl1, a combination of high levels of Ngn2 and low levels of Lhx3 promote reprogramming to induced motor neurons. Notably, the trends we observed in the hyperproliferative population were diminished when examining the non-hyperproliferative cells, highlighting the utility of isolating populations with inherently different reprogramming propensities (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S3D</xref>).</p><p id="P25">Using the fluorescent mRuby2 reporter to identify cells expressing the transgenes, we calculated the reprogramming efficiency for each transcription factor reporter.

Therefore, we sought to identify the optimal encoding of all three factors by exploring all permutations on a single transcript, polycistronic cassette. In addition, through screening a variety of C-terminal tags, we identified a tagged Ngn2 variant that does not reduce reprogramming and allows us to identity ectopic Ngn2 via immunostaining (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Fig. S4A</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">F</xref>).

Our results suggest that proliferation confers a state of plasticity that exceeds what high expression of transcription factors alone can confer. Once cells attain this proliferation-mediated state of plasticity, transcription factor levels direct cells in distinct ways. High levels of the pioneer transcription factor Ngn2 correlate to higher rates of reprogramming, whereas expression of Isl1 and Lhx3 do not show positive correlations early in reprogramming. Putatively, early opening of chromatin via pioneer activity of Ngn2 may provide accessibility to the other transcription factors. Additionally, high rates of transcription in hyperproliferative cells allow cells to reprogram at near-deterministic rates (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Babos et al., 2019</xref>).

As we tagged Ngn2 (Ngn2<sup>&#x000d7;3HA</sup>), we could specifically identify the transgene via the HA tag. For both types of measurements, we could map how levels of transcription factors translate to rates of reprogramming, suggesting the potential for designing optimal levels and stoichiometries of factors. While we expect that the total levels of transcription factors are what dictate reprogramming, the ectopic factors represent the primary species for driving and guiding cell-fate transitions.</p><p id="P44">Although we have gained insight into how transcription factor levels and proliferation drive reprogramming, there are still open questions. To optimally guide cells through transitions, we sought to understand how ectopic levels of individual transcription factors impact reprogramming. However, in designing single-transcript cassettes, we could not predict which designs would perform best. While high expression of Ngn2 at 4 dpi differentiated effective from non-effective designs, the ordering was not fully predictive of expression. Thus, we conclude that screening provides the best tool to identify optimal designs as the strict rules of design of polycistronic cassettes remain unclear. Potentially, differences in expression of factors that emerge later in the conversion timeline will impact a single cell&#x02019;s trajectory. Longitudinal tracking of Oct4 in reprogramming human fibroblasts indicates that cells that establish high expression early sustain expression over the course of reprogramming (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Ilia et al., 2023</xref>). Future systems that can more precisely vary and measure all three ectopic transcription factor levels in single cells may help elucidate how cells interpret transcription factor combinations to acquire new cell fates.</p><p id="P45">In profiling the transcriptomes of induced motor neurons generated from different cocktails, we found that our optimized, two-virus cocktail leads to a higher fraction of incompletely reprogrammed cells compared to our six-factor cocktail. Eliminating these partially converted cells may be important in developing <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> disease models and cell-based therapies (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Locatelli et al., 2022</xref>). Alternatively, given the power of the transcription factors to drive cells to a post-mitotic fate in the presence of the oncogenes, cocktails of neuronal transcription factors may be useful in arresting growth of transformed cells with minimal impact on non-proliferative cells.</p><p id="P46">While cell lines engineered with inducible transcription factors provide a system for limiting the extrinsic variance associated with viral infection, these systems provide limited flexibility in modifying transcription factor cocktails (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Elbaz et al., 2022</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Jain et al., 2023</xref>). Additionally, achieving rapid, scalable reprogramming <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and translatable technologies for <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> reprogramming requires efficient transgenic systems that induce reprogramming without the need for extensive cell line engineering. We aimed to develop systems that could be translated to <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> reprogramming and to adult human fibroblasts from diverse donors. By developing a species-specific high-efficiency module, we increase proliferation in human fibroblasts which correlates to higher reprogramming rates and more morphologically mature motor neurons. Unlike iPSC-derived neurons, directly converted neurons retain signatures of aging (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Mertens et al., 2015</xref>). Developing scalable methods for generating neurons from primary adult fibroblasts will support disease modeling in adult-onset neurodegenerative disease such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, Huntington&#x02019;s disease, Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease, and Frontotemporal dementia. By generating neurons from a greater number of patient-derived cells, direct conversion may provide a more representative survey of cellular diversity within a single patient and avoid clonal bias introduced in clone-based iPSC-derived models.</p><p id="P47">With our optimized cocktail, we achieve neurotrophic factor-free motor neuron reprogramming and show that our reprogrammed motor neurons survive <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> grafting. As the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> environment may provide varying or limited neurotrophic support, our work highlights that cells can reprogram in the absence of neurotrophic support. Moreover, reprogrammed cells can be grafted following focal injury as needed for the replacement of damaged tissue, opening future studies for <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> reprogramming and cellular therapies.</p><p id="P48">Collectively, our results show that proliferation history and transcription factor expression combine to drive cell-fate transitions. By developing tools that more precisely perturb the reprogramming process, we will improve our understanding and control of cellular reprogramming. Further, by developing single transcript designs, we open the potential for integrating control of reprogramming with the expanding array of synthetic biology tools and gene circuits for tailoring expression within specific subpopulations. Beyond targeting specific cell types, control of transgenes to induce reprograming of human cells will improve safety and efficacy of gene and cell-based therapies for regeneration of neural tissue.</p></sec><sec id="S12"><title>EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS</title><sec id="S13"><title>Cell lines and tissue culture</title><p id="P49">HEK293T, Plat-E, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS at 37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

The concentrated cell solution was backloaded into a pulled glass micropipette prior to connecting to the stereotaxic frame. The one cell stock was injected into all animals with injections alternating between mice from the healthy and stroke groups. 1 &#x003bc;L of cell solution was injected into the same striatal regions as that used to create the stroke at 0.15 &#x003bc;L/min using target coordinates relative to Bregma: +1 mm A/P, +2.5 mm L/M. The pipette was lowered to &#x02212;3.5 mm D/V for the start of the injection and moved up +0.5mm twice over the course of the injection to a final location of &#x02212;2.5 mm D/V to improve deposition of cells in brain tissue. The micropipette was allowed to dwell in the brain at the injection site for an additional 4 minutes at the end of the injection. The micropipette was then removed from the brain slowly and incrementally over a 1-minute period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S33"><title>Immunohistochemistry for <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> cell grafts</title><sec id="S34"><title>Transcardial perfusions</title><p id="P70">After terminal anesthesia by overdose isoflurane inhalation, mice were perfused transcardially with heparinized saline and 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) that was prepared from 32% PFA Aqueous Solution (Cat# 15714, EMS), using a peristaltic pump at a rate of 7 mL/min. Approximately, 10 mL of heparinized saline and 50 mL of 4% PFA was used per animal. Brains were immediately dissected after perfusion and post-fixed in 4% PFA for 6 hours at room temperature. After PFA post-fixing, brains were cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS) at 4&#x000b0;C for at least 3 days with the sucrose solution replaced once after 2 days and stored at 4&#x000b0;C until further use.</p></sec><sec id="S35"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p id="P71">Coronal sections of mouse brains receiving grafts were cut (40 &#x000b5;m thick) using a Leica CM1950 Cryostat.

All secondary antibodies used in this study were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). All secondary antibodies were affinity purified whole IgG(H+L) antibodies with donkey host and target species dictated by the specific primary antibody used. All secondary antibodies were stored in 50% glycerol solution and diluted at a concentration of 1:250 in 5% normal donkey serum in TBS when incubated with brain histological sections. Nuclei were stained with 4&#x02019;,6&#x02019;-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI; 2ng/ml; Molecular Probes). Sections were mounted using ProLong Gold anti-fade reagent (ThermoFisher).
