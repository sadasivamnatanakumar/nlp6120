The Capturing Data on Antimicrobial Resistance Patterns and Trends in Use in Regions of Asia (CAPTURA) project accessed aggregated retrospective data from non-IEDCR study sites and 9 IEDCR sites to understand the pattern and extent of AMR and to use analyzed data to guide ongoing and future national AMR surveillance in both public and private laboratories. Record-keeping practices, data completeness, quality control, and antimicrobial susceptibility test practices were investigated in all laboratories participating in case-based IEDCR surveillance and laboratory-based CAPTURA sites. All 9 IEDCR laboratories recorded detailed case-based data (n = 16 816) in electronic format for a priority subset of processed laboratory samples. In contrast, most CAPTURA sites (n = 18/33 [54.5%]) used handwritten registers to store data. The CAPTURA sites were characterized by fewer recorded variables (such as patient demographics, clinical history, and laboratory findings) with 1 020 197 individual data, less integration of patient records with the laboratory information system, and nonuniform practice of data recording; however, data were collected from all available clinical samples. The analyses conducted on AMR data collected by IEDCR and CAPTURA in Bangladesh provide current data collection status and highlight opportunities to improve ongoing data collection to strengthen current AMR surveillance system initiatives. We recommend a tailored approach to conduct AMR surveillance in high-burden, resource-limited settings.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser"><p>In this study we collected and explored retrospective antimicrobial resistance data from microbiology laboratories across Bangladesh and compared with those from active case-based surveillance carried out by the national surveillance network to inform policy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>active surveillance</kwd><kwd>case-based surveillance</kwd><kwd>laboratory-based surveillance</kwd><kwd>AMR surveillance</kwd><kwd>Bangladesh</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>The spread of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria is a significant global public health threat [<xref rid="ciad561-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The misuse of antibiotics in humans, animals, and the environment and a &#x0201c;largely unregulated pluralistic health system&#x0201d; aggravate the situation, especially in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) in South Asia [<xref rid="ciad561-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="ciad561-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In Bangladesh, for example, antibiotics are readily available over-the-counter in pharmacies, with up to 59.4% of nonprescribed antibiotics dispensed from the World Health Organization's (WHO) Access group, 46.5% from the Watch group, and 44% from the Reserve group [<xref rid="ciad561-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The Communicable Disease Control (CDC) program is the National Action Plan's (NAP) implementing agency for the containment of AMR, and AMR surveillance data play a vital role in this regard. Strengthening and gradually expanding this system is an important priority [<xref rid="ciad561-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although the CDC programme was established to implement the NAP to address AMR containment in Bangladesh from 2017 to 2022 [<xref rid="ciad561-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], the availability of surveillance data remains a challenge for accurately assessing the actual burden of AMR in the country [<xref rid="ciad561-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ciad561-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The CDC and the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) have led AMR activities since the release of Bangladesh's NAP in 2017 [<xref rid="ciad561-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The IEDCR is engaged in AMR surveillance activities in 8 public hospitals (<xref rid="ciad561-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref><italic toggle="yes"><xref rid="ciad561-F1" ref-type="fig">B</xref></italic>), which are primarily located in urban settings. It has now been expanded to 11 sites. With a web platform [<xref rid="ciad561-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] linked to the WHO Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS), IEDCR provides real-time access to sample case information recorded in each sentinel site, including information on patient demographics, clinical data, and microbiological culture data [<xref rid="ciad561-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. While the IEDCR represents the sectoral AMR Surveillance Coordination Centre and the National Reference Laboratory for national AMR surveillance activities in Bangladesh, other stakeholders, such as the Directorate General of Drug Administration, the Department of Livestock Services, the WHO, the Development Alternatives Incorporated (DAI), Fleming Fund Country Grant, the Medicines, Technologies and Pharmaceutical Services program (MTaPS), and the Capturing Data on Antimicrobial Resistance Patterns and Trends in Use in Regions of Asia project (CAPTURA, a regional Fleming Fund initiative), are actively engaged in improving antimicrobial resistance, consumption, and use surveillance activities in the country [<xref rid="ciad561-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="ciad561-F1" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Capturing Data on Antimicrobial Resistance Patterns and Trends in Use in Regions of Asia (CAPTURA) and Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) participating laboratories across Bangladesh.

With commitment from and coordination with the CDC and IEDCR, CAPTURA was formally initiated in the country in May 2020 during the peak of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. One of the major aims of CAPTURA was to explore available retrospective data to conduct laboratory-based AMR surveillance in Bangladesh. CAPTURA also aimed to manifest the challenges and limitations of the existing AMR surveillance system by assessing laboratory conditions using the Rapid Laboratory Quality Assessment tool [<xref rid="ciad561-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This article describes the CAPTURA project activities of identifying data sources, data collection, record-keeping practices, data completeness, antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) practices, quality control, AST validity checks, and antimicrobial patterns and compares with the IEDCR-led active surveillance sites. These findings contribute to expanding AMR surveillance activities in the country.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="ciad561-s0"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="ciad561-s0.1"><title>Study Design and Settings</title><p>We collected retrospective data on AST from 34 microbiology laboratories in Bangladesh between 2019 and 2022.

This was followed by eliminating outliers such as inconsistent date formats, incorrect nomenclatures, and identifying data entry errors using WHONET software quality functions. Since each dataset was obtained from a different data management system, a tailored approach for data curation was required. In addition to data cleaning using WHONET, a manual examination was performed to curate the information. Additional SQLite Database Browser [<xref rid="ciad561-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] software was used to detect outliers such as naming the microorganisms incorrectly, missing records on specimen type and dates, and inaccurate and inconsistent AST results.

This included data recorded in handwritten registers, electronic formats and, in some sites, or a combination of both (<xref rid="ciad561-F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). IEDCR surveillance recorded data (n = 16 816) with multiple variables, such as patient general information (n = 6), demographic information (n = 10), clinical information (n = 5), previous antibiotic treatment history (n = 6), comorbidity (n = 6), provisional diagnosis history (n = 5), specimen information (n = 6), microorganism isolated, and AST results with different antibiotics with zone of inhibition (<xref rid="sup1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). These data were documented by dedicated personnel for patients attending inpatient and outpatient departments.</p><p>In CAPTURA sites with handwritten data entry systems (n = 18 sites), variables such as patient encrypted ID, age, sex, clinical department, ward, unit, specimen number, specimen date, specimen type, microorganism reported, and AST results were collected from the patient registry in the microbiology laboratory. Although 6 of 18 paper-based recording systems sites had laboratory information systems, data could not be retrieved primarily due to poor entry and management practices. For example, the data backup process was unreliable, and records were deleted every 6 months with some laboratories storing data in a single column in Microsoft Excel and use of Microsoft Word or a bioM&#x000e9;rieux VITEK 2 database for backup. Similarly, in 12 hospital laboratories where data were stored in electronic systems, CAPTURA was able to extract evidence more effectively due to the storage of integrated information (including from patient admission to discharge). As a result, the data quality generated from these sites was comparable to IEDCR. However, there were differences in the numbers of antibiotics tested, microorganisms isolated, and specimen type across the 12 hospitals, with some missing department, unit, and other information. This impacted data quality during WHONET BacLink conversion. In laboratories with both data recording (paper-based and electronic) systems in place, records such as patient ID, age, sex, clinical data, ward, unit, specimen number, specimen date, specimen type, organism name, and AST findings were obtained from both sources and merged.</p></sec></sec><sec id="ciad561-s1.2"><title>Data Completeness in IEDCR and CAPTURA Sites</title><p>All of the laboratories participating in IEDCR surveillance recorded case-based data (patient demography, clinical history including antibiotic use, comorbidities, diagnosis, specimen details, and AST results) in electronic format. CAPTURA obtained data from 34 sites. Among 33 of the CAPTURA sites, 18 had paper-based registers, 12 had electronic systems, and 3 had both formats.

Overall, the IEDCR and CAPTURA electronic records had a comparable proportion of invalid AST recorded (6.28% and 6.43%, respectively). For individual antibiotics, a higher proportion of invalid tests was found in IEDCR for fusidic acid and oxacillin, compared to CAPTURA.</p><p>Among CAPTURA sites, the proportion of invalid tests was higher in electronic format (6.43%) than in paper-based records (4.51%), followed by combination entries (3.12%). A higher proportion of invalid tests was recorded in paper-based registers for amoxicillin and cephradine and 4 drugs in combination format (cloxacillin, fusidic acid, tigecycline, and vancomycin). Although the paper-based form had records for all 17 of 17 antibiotics, the proportion of invalid tests noted was lower than in other formats.</p><p>For <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>, 5.6% (940/16 830) of records were categorized as invalid AST in IEDCR surveillance. WHONET defined the invalid test based on testing an antibiotic for which there were no testing guidelines. For CAPTURA, in comparison, this was 5.6% (18 995/338 142) in handwritten entries and 5.9% (38 005/640 904) and 3.5% (1427/41 151) for data extracted in electronic and combination formats, respectively. Like <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic>, we observed 5 antibiotics included in IEDCR surveillance, while paper-based entry in CAPTURA had the highest number of antibiotics (17/18). Although different laboratories performed AST using a variety of antibiotics, the average for CAPTURA sites was 18. The most commonly recorded invalid test in IEDCR sites was for cephalexin, with approximately 82% of results not complying with CLSI guidelines. Similarly, for CAPTURA sites, invalid tests varied among recording formats, for example, amoxicillin (8197/18 995 [43.2%]) in paper-based entry, cephradine (11 458/38 005 [30.2%]) in electronic records, and tazobactam (498/1427 [34.9%]) only in sites with a combination record entry system. The paper-based data from CAPTURA sites included the greater numbers of antibiotics because different sites used different antibiotic panels. However, the proportion of invalid tests recorded for individual antibiotics was lower compared to IEDCR and CAPTURA sites with electronic recording systems. Notably, the first released standard operating procedure (SOP) for all IEDCR sites was corrected at the end of 2019, and CAPTURA collected data between 2017 and 2019.</p><p>To understand the AMR pattern, we compared antibiotic resistance profiles for <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> as a representative of gram-negative organisms and <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> as a representative of gram-positive organisms between the CAPTURA and IEDCR datasets. Approximately 90% of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> isolates were resistant to ampicillin whereas amikacin and imipenem were the effective drugs of choice in both datasets (<xref rid="ciad561-F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). For <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic>, among the common tested drugs between IEDCR and CAPTURA sites, azithromycin was found to be most resistant whereas linezolid and gentamicin were susceptible drugs in both datasets (<xref rid="ciad561-F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). We observed comparable patterns in both datasets, which reflects AMR trends. For both isolates, there are difference in the antibiotic panels between IEDCR and CAPTURA sites (<xref rid="ciad561-F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). IEDCR sites have their own SOP according to the CLSI guideline and they follow the uniform antibiotic panels as instructed by the IEDCR. In contrary, CAPTURA sites were individual laboratories, and they followed their own manuals. As a result, there are similar antibiotics from the same group of drugs in the dataset of CAPTURA sites.</p><fig position="float" id="ciad561-F3" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>

IEDCR data were collected between 2017 and 2019, and CAPTURA data cover information from 2016 to 2020. Both IEDCR and CAPTURA sites were located primarily in urban areas. IEDCR's active surveillance collected patient information daily with at least 1 staff member stationed at each site. In contrast, CAPTURA accessed aggregated retrospective data from all non-IEDCR study sites input locally by laboratory staff as well as results from 9 case-based IEDCR sites.</p><p>The GLASS protocol highlights the importance of AMR data validity, consistency, and completeness [<xref rid="ciad561-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Data completeness is key to AMR surveillance programs as the unavailability of complete quality information results in inaccurate reporting of AMR rates, which impacts the design and delivery of control measures [<xref rid="ciad561-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The retrospective data available at CAPTURA sites were characterized by fewer recorded variables, less complete data, poor integration of patient records with the laboratory information system, inconsistent and unreliable data recording practices, and data collected all at once. However, data volume and geographic coverage were much higher than in IEDCR sites. The GLASS procedure, meanwhile, was followed in IEDCR sites, where records were only stored in an electronic database to define variability standards, resulting in better data completeness metrics. Detailed patient-level data were gathered from much smaller samples of isolates according to the data collection protocol. This difference is likely due to data sourcing methods; for example, CAPTURA collected retrospective data from all samples or all positive samples from sites routinely not participating in AMR surveillance, while IEDCR surveillance was designed to collect prospective case-based data by a trained individual in defined locations for a subset of all samples collected. Furthermore, the IEDCR approach provided more detailed and granular data for a small subset of samples processed in the laboratory. In contrast, the CAPTURA approach overlooked the clinical detail available within the IEDCR approach but incorporated available results from all samples or at least all positive samples. In both circumstances, differences in the availability of human and technical resources impacted the outcome. On-site IEDCR surveillance staff received more comprehensive training; followed a common laboratory SOP; were subject to external quality assurance and retesting procedures to maintain the quality of laboratory results; and had access to computers, software, and internet connectivity, all of which greatly impact the feasibility of AMR surveillance. Furthermore, we found that using electronic tools for record keeping was advantageous in both IEDCR and CAPTURA sites. For example, in most cases, paper-based registries complied poorly with GLASS procedures, lacked information on American Type Culture Collection and specimen details, and used an incorrect microbial nomenclature system. However, it should be noted that laboratory information systems from different providers were used in 9 of the 12 CAPTURA sites with electronic data recording systems, resulting in differences in defining and recording data variables. In addition, we found that 6 of 18 sites currently using a paper-based entry system had Laboratory Information System that were not in active use. Sanju et al (unpublished data) studied the challenges of implementing the WHONET/BacLink system in Nepal and reported the input of incomparable data elements across different software, inadequate routine training, frequent transfer of trained staff, poor real-time technical support, and integration issues with ongoing hospital information systems as key challenges to adopting such systems. With a challenge to sustainably implement technically demanding methods in LMICs, no such alternative should impact the collection of AMR data for ongoing system evaluation and capacity-building purposes in the long run.</p><p>Comparing the 10 most common microorganisms reported in IEDCR with the 3 different CAPTURA site recording systems demonstrates the difference in prevalence and species level classification of bacterial types. The WHO GLASS protocol lists pathogens for AMR surveillance [<xref rid="ciad561-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Among the common pathogens identified in IEDCR and CAPTURA sites, approximately 50% were included in the GLASS priority list. This difference may be due to commonly circulating microorganisms in the community or inadequate laboratory capacity to report pathogens requiring more complex growth conditions, such as media supplements for <italic toggle="yes">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">S. pneumoniae</italic> [<xref rid="ciad561-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Therefore, laboratories should be equipped to report pathogens with additional growth conditions while being able to characterize microorganisms at the species level. This is critical as it affects the selection, interpretation, and clinical correlation of AST results, impacting data quality and reliability for patient management and AMR surveillance.</p><p>Invalid AST results were analyzed as a proxy to understand the quality of microbiology laboratories in performing such tests. Invalid tests were defined when laboratory procedures were not consistent with the CLSI AST requirements M100 [<xref rid="ciad561-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This included testing antimicrobials with no quality control or interpretation criteria available, incorrect bacteria&#x02013;antibiotic combinations (eg, testing intrinsically resistant antibiotics), use of inaccurate antibiotic disk potency, technical errors with WHONET/BacLink configuration, differences in breakpoints suggested by the vendor and CLSI or European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing, and knowledge gaps regarding antibiotics used for characterization versus treatment (eg, novobiocin, ceftriaxone/clavulanic acid combination). Other factors include misinterpretation of surrogate testing results and the use of the disk diffusion method where minimum inhibitory concentration is recommended. There were fewer antibiotics with invalid AST for either <italic toggle="yes">S. aureus</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="ciad561-T3" ref-type="table">Tables 3</xref> and <xref rid="ciad561-T4" ref-type="table">4</xref>) in IEDCR sites than in CAPTURA sites. This is likely related to the 36 antibiotics tested in IEDCR sites compared to at least 68 tested in CAPTURA sites, owing to the use of different antibiotic panels with distinct antibiotics. Additionally, if a disk is unavailable or if all the antibiotics in the panel are found to be resistant, the same facility may occasionally use an alternative antibiotic, sometimes on the request of physicians for the purpose of treatment. On the other hand, IEDCR sites only utilized the antibiotics mentioned in their SOP and typically did not experience a disk insufficiency problem. Compared to the electronic format, handwritten registers had a more significant number of antibiotics included for an invalid result. However, in the majority of cases, the proportion of unacceptable findings was higher in electronic format. In addition, we found that higher numbers of privately owned facilities record antibiogram data in electronic format compared to public hospitals/laboratories. This shows the advantages and disadvantages of each record-keeping and surveillance system. Although electronic data keeping and active case-based surveillance result in more intrinsically reliable data, human, and technical resource constraints limit the application of such methods in LMICs such as Bangladesh. Based on this study, we recommend a cautious approach with a gradual transition to advanced AMR surveillance practices such as electronic record-keeping systems. With a challenge to sustainably implement technically demanding methods in LMICs, no such alternative should impact the collection of AMR data for ongoing system evaluation and capacity-building purposes in the long run.</p><p>One of the CAPTURA activities included facilitating the adoption of electronic AMR data collection methods in our study sites. We provided technical support to develop a function within existing systems to export patient and laboratory information and we developed an open-source data visualization tool, QAAPT [<xref rid="ciad561-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], which is compatible with BacLink converted WHONET datasets and integrated with the District Health Information System (DHIS2) software [<xref rid="ciad561-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The laboratory-based surveillance network can be expanded with the aid of such an interoperability strategy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="ciad561-s3"><title>CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVE</title><p>While we found data quality and reliability differences between IEDCR and CAPTURA sites, this study demonstrates the feasibility of expanding the number of surveillance sites beyond those led by IEDCR by assessing the existence of quality AST methodologies and data collection practices for a more robust and geographically representative surveillance system. Considering the substantial resources required for case-based surveillance, it is possible to select more sites for laboratory-based surveillance on the same platform in order to perform quality control and improvement activities and to establish coordinated laboratory networking. Prioritizing the transition from current paper-based practices to electronic platforms will help to ensure data management quality; however, to ensure overall validity of microbiology data for surveillance of resistance will require extensive external quality assurance initiatives and proper assessments of potential selection biases in surveillance data. To improve existing processes and continue working toward controlling the increasing burden of AMR, we propose establishing an AMR integrated surveillance system in Bangladesh that will communicate information with unique laboratory or health information systems, WHONET software, and the existing IEDCR surveillance system (<xref rid="ciad561-F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). The platform could incorporate an advanced analysis pipeline with dashboards available for public and restricted use. In such a scenario, each laboratory would have access to the record and would edit and monitor their data, which could then be shared for policy purposes. In addition, this platform would allow laboratories to download a list of organisms, specimens, hospital departments, and antibiotics with standard names and codes, enabling uniform record-keeping practice. Beyond expanding AMR surveillance, this could also contribute to addressing the need for an integrated hospital information system, which is largely missing in public healthcare facilities in Bangladesh.</p><fig position="float" id="ciad561-F4" fig-type="figure"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>The proposed architecture of the antimicrobial resistance integrated surveillance system in Bangladesh.
