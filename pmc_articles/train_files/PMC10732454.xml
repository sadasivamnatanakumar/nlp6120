Introduction</title><p>The intrinsic relationship between nutrition and the environment is well established, as eating patterns affect the environment and vice versa [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Technological advances, globalization and changes in agricultural systems have stimulated changes in the human diet [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and the current global food system is increasingly associated with harm to health ranging from food insecurity to significant environmental losses [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Thus, there is a need for sustainable diets that are culturally acceptable, economically accessible, safe and healthy, that minimize negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems and optimize both natural and human resources [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>In 2019, the EAT-Lancet Commission Summary Report delineated a combination of food groups and intake ranges that would enhance the multiple benefits for health and the planet. The Commission&#x02019;s aim was to develop global scientific goals for achieving healthy and sustainable diets, called the "Anthropocene Diet", which were proposed to optimize human health without pushing the limits of the planet and which, if adopted, could significantly reduce the environmental impact of food production [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The current food production system has a significant impact on the environment, contributing around 20&#x02013;30% of total greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE). In addition, approximately 24% of arable land suffers some degree of soil degradation, depending on the agricultural model adopted. Intensive land use for monoculture and livestock farming results in deforestation and alarming loss of biodiversity [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, environmental problems are not only restricted to the food production phase; they also extend to processes included in the supply chain, such as transportation, processing and food preparation. Waste and residues generated along the food supply chain also contribute to the aggravation of these environmental problems [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>A universal healthy reference diet (planetary health diet or EAT&#x02013;Lancet diet) served as the basis for the development of indexes of sustainable diets that integrate multiples indicators as environmental, social, economic and health [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The proposed diet consists of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, moderate or low amounts of seafood and poultry and little or no red meat, refined grains, added sugars and starchy vegetables [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>This initiative sparked discussions on the need for changes in contemporary food systems through health sustainable diets [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] to reformulate a global food system, as continuing with the same attitudes is no longer an option [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and, if nothing is done, the world runs the risk of not meeting the Sustainable Development Goals established by the member countries of the United Nations on the 2030 agenda [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Changes in dietary patterns and lifestyles of populations around the world in recent decades stimulate the need for the adoption of sustainable diets and tools to measure these diets, as recommended by the Commission which proposed that this transformation be achieved equitably and across different populations and food system contexts [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>2.1 Study design</title><p>Given the complexity of sustainable healthy diets and the vast number of sustainable diet indexes proposed and reported in the academic literature, a scoping review design was adopted. As opposed to systematic literature reviews, which seek to answer a very specific set of questions, scoping reviews aim to defined as a type of study that seeks to explore the main concepts of the topic in question, to ascertain the size, scope and nature of the study, condensing and publishing the data, thus pointing out the existing research gaps [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>The present review was conducted following the PRISMA extension for scoping review (PRISMA-ScR) [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and followed the PRISMA checklist <bold>(</bold><xref rid="pone.0296026.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>).

Discussion</title><p>The present scoping review investigated different tools that identify sustainable diets, which are fundamental for analyzing sustainability, establishing goals and following up the evolution of the subject as well as political decision making on the local, national and planetary levels. In our study, we found that the indices that measure sustainable diets present robust evidence in relation to what is recommended by the EAT-Lancet Commission. They are multidimensional and consider various sustainability indicators (environmental, health, economic and social); most of them allow for a gradual score that includes all the intermediate values of individual food consumption, favoring a better distinction between the degrees of adherence of individuals. In addition, they also consider interchangeable food groups, allowing adaptations to different populations, as recommended by the reference diet.</p><p>There has been an evolution over time in the development of indices to assess sustainable diets, with indicators and data used to assess the sustainability of diets adapted to each specific territory. When discussing sustainable diets, it is essential to promote an inclusive and sensitive approach to local particularities, considering the food culture, production systems, socio-economic characteristics and environmental impacts specific to each place. In this way, we can develop effective and tailored strategies to promote food sustainability in different geographical contexts [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Adherence to health and sustainable diets varied according to the population studied and assessment methods employed. Countries with less economic development had lower scores and, consequently, lower scores of adherence [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], which may be related to social and economic issues of the food system [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Sex, age and income are variables for which the most distinctions are found in different populations, as it is well established the adherence to this type of diet is greater among the female population, individuals with a higher income <italic toggle="yes">per capita</italic>, older age groups and residents of urban areas [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>The lower adherence may be related to the contemporary eating pattern, with inadequate quantities of fruits, vegetables and plant-based proteins [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Similar findings were reported in studies conducted in Mexico and India [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The stimulation of plant-based foods, which involve a lower generation of GHGE, could result in an increase in cost for some population groups [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Indeed, there is evidence that the EAT-Lancet diet is beyond the reach of needy families because nutrient-rich foods tend to come with a higher price tag compared to starchy staples and items rich in sugar and fat [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], which explains the lower adherence in developing countries [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Kesse-Guyot et al. (2021) pointed out the affordability of a sustainable and healthy diet, they found that participants with high EAT-Lancet adherence had the highest diet cost [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However the EAT-Lancet report it largely deals with the need to make a healthy and sustainable diet accessible to everyone from an economic point of view and gives suggestions to how to make it real [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. There is also the issue of the stigmatization of this plant-based eating pattern for disrupting social conventions related to food, as the fear of stigmatization can be a barrier to avoiding meat consumption, which can be an obstacle to implementing the Eat-lancet diet [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. A healthy, environmentally sustainable diet should be accessible, which could limit indices that do not consider the cost of food [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Regarding structure among the indices analyzed, the ELD-1 and NB-EAT use a binary score, with 1 attributed if the participant met a goal and 0 if the goal was not met; the result is the sum of the nutritional goals met [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The SHED index records agreement on a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 4 [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], whereas the EAT, WISH, PHDI and SDI have a gradual score proportional to the consumption of foods [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This method is encouraged by the EAT-Lancet report for the obtainment of intermediate values, which are common and more faithful for the assessment of food intake [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Food intake was addressed mainly in groups. Only the NB-EAT was based on nutrients [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The use of interchangeable groups is encouraged in the creation of indices based on the EAT-Lancet Commission. However, the use of nutrients enables a less precise assessment of adherence to these recommendations due to the provision of nutrient composition values of sustainable diets in a more restrictive, less informative way [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>To define environmental sustainability indicators in the food sector, it is necessary to consider the different environmental dimensions impacted, such as GHGE, water resource use, land degradation and biodiversity loss [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Among the main outcomes analyzed, the anthropogenic emission of GHGE was the most reported component and several researchers found a positive correlation between the total GHGE related to the diet and total energy and grams of the foods consumed [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Only the SHED index [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] is limited in this respect, as it does not quantify GHGs, which is the main metric to assess environmental burden, but by building on the EAT-Lancet reports, the SHED index assesses environmental burden indirectly by encouraging the consumption of a more plant-based and red meat-restricted diet to achieve the United Nations 2030 sustainable development goals and alleviate the burden of non-communicable diseases [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>Food production affects the environment and vice versa, as high environmental GHGE loads and unsustainable use of natural capital, such as overexploitation of natural resources and degradation of ecosystems, leads to environmental problems that have direct repercussions on climate instability. This climate instability, in turn, affects food production, creating additional challenges for food and nutrition security for future generations [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0296026.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>The benefits of sustainable diets to human health are well established [<xref rid="pone.0296026.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].

Conclusions</title><p>The evidence from this review highlights the diverse approaches employed by researchers to define sustainable diets based on the recommendations of the EAT-Lancet report. Our analysis significantly contributes to the current body of knowledge, presenting a description of the indexes that evaluate sustainable diets and indicators frequently used in the analyzes of articles (environmental and health). We identified serious barriers that hinder progress towards healthy and sustainable diets, including the difficulty of comparing different indices, the tendency to neglect social aspects and the lack of common definitions and metrics. Despite being challenging, the description of an &#x02019;ideal&#x02019; index that harmonizes the various indicators, promoting positive changes towards a more sustainable future is highlighted.</p></sec><sec id="sec019" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0296026.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>PRISMA-ScR checklist.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0296026.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0296026.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Quality assessment for cohort studies (Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale criteria)*.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0296026.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0296026.s003" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Quality assessment for cross-sectional studies (Modified Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale criteria)*.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0296026.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0296026.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Wiseman</surname><given-names>SA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>D&#x000f6;tsch-Klerk</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Neufingerl</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Martins F de</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name>. <article-title>Future Food: Sustainable Diets for Healthy People and a Healthy Planet</article-title>. <source>Int J Nutrology</source>. <year>2019</year>;<volume>12</volume>(<issue>01</issue>).</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0296026.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Remans</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Flynn</surname><given-names>DFB</given-names></name>, <name><surname>DeClerck</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Diru</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Fanzo</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gaynor</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>. <article-title>Assessing nutritional diversity of cropping systems in African villages</article-title>. <source>PLoS One</source>. <year>2011</year>;<volume>6</volume>(<issue>6</issue>). <comment>doi: </comment><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0021235</pub-id>
