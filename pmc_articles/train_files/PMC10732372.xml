However, many current pharmaceutical anthelmintics are harmful to dung beetles, their presence can have a negative impact on biological systems. Phytochemical anthelmintics are an alternative to ecotoxic synthetic pharmaceutical anthelmintics, although ecotoxicological tests of their possible indirect effects on dung beetles are required to demonstrate their viability. In this study, the potential ecotoxicity of thymol, carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde and garlic oil (diallyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide) were tested for the first time. Inhibition of antennal response was measured as a relevant parameter by obtaining relevant toxicity thresholds derived from concentration&#x02012;response curves, such as the IC<sub>50</sub>. All phytochemical compounds tested were demonstrated to be suitable alternative candidates to the highly ecotoxic compound ivermectin, considering their non-toxicity to nontarget organisms. Residues of the phytochemical antiparasitics found in cattle droppings were extremely low, even undetectable in the case of diallyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide. Furthermore, our results showed that none of the phytochemical compounds have ecotoxic effects, even at extremely high concentrations, including those almost 1000 times higher than what is most likely to be found in dung susceptible to ingestion by dung beetles in the field. We can conclude that the four selected phytochemical compounds meet the requirements to be considered reliable alternatives to ecotoxic veterinary medicinal products, such as ivermectin.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

Many current pharmaceutical medicinal products are harmful to invertebrate, fungal, bacterial and even vertebrate species, so their presence can have a negative impact on biological systems [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Studies worldwide, but especially from the Northern Hemisphere, report an alarming decline, both in abundance and diversity, of insect species, especially certain taxa such as dung beetles [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295753.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The main factors related to this decrease in biodiversity are the chemical contamination of nontarget species by pesticides, habitat degradation (i.e., resulting from intensive practices in the livestock sector) and climate change [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Traditional livestock grazing practices that rely on the sustainable use of natural resources constitute key diversifying agents [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] to maintain mosaic landscapes and prevent the loss of biodiversity in agroecosystems [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, traditional grazing systems have been frequently replaced in recent decades by more intensive practices, which use considerable amounts of synthetic anthelmintics as a preventive strategy to control gastrointestinal parasites in livestock.</p><p>Numerous studies have shown that the sustainability of the livestock sector will only be possible if healthy (diverse and abundant) dung decomposer insect communities are preserved because they contribute to crucial ecological activities such as dung decomposition, nutrient recycling, soil bioturbation and aeration, parasite control, plant growth, seed dispersal and changes in soil microbial communities [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], soil carbon sequestration in the soil [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions from dung pats [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295753.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, in Europe, the decline in dung beetle populations since the middle of the 20th century has been associated with the routine use of highly toxic veterinary medical products [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The indiscriminate use of veterinary medicinal products has been identified as the main threat to Mediterranean dung beetles, currently causing 21 endemic species from this region to be listed as threatened on the IUCN Red List [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Neither farmers nor related stakeholders (e.g., veterinarians) are properly informed of the adverse effects of the preventive and routine use of synthetic pharmaceutical anthelmintics on biodiversity, while the necessary alternative strategies are also limited or unknown. The decline in traditional livestock management practices concurred with the progressive loss of traditional ecological knowledge as farmers specialized and became more dependent on external inputs, including synthetic anthelmintics. Before the creation of synthetic anthelmintics in the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, farmers relied on locally available plants to control livestock intestinal parasites [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thus, traditions and their associated knowledge are rapidly disappearing, with a loss of potential long-term alternatives to synthetic pharmaceutical anthelmintics [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Alternative plant-based products have proliferated during the past ten years as parasite resistance to traditional synthetic anthelmintics has increased [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295753.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For example, Dr. Duke&#x02019;s Phytochemical and Ethnobotanical databases from the USDA [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] compile 1,029 plants with 57 different chemical compounds with anthelmintic activity and 549 plants containing 24 chemicals with acaricide properties. Reviews also recorded more than 200 secondary metabolites (from at least ten organic chemical families) with anthelmintic activity [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295753.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Although phytochemical anthelmintics may provide an alternative to ecotoxic synthetic pharmaceutical anthelmintics, there are no data about their possible indirect effects (once they are excreted by livestock) on nontarget organisms such as dung beetles, or even if the effects are concentration dependent.

The practical absence of chemical residues in cattle excrement after the consumption of commercial formulations as a food supplement reinforces the suitability of this type of phytochemical compounds. For THY and CVR, the extremely low concentrations of the residues in cow dung may be due to their rapid elimination through urine. For example, the half-life of THY and CVR in the digestive tract of piglets is approximately two hours due to their fast stomach and proximal intestine absorption and renal excretion [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In rabbits, only trace amounts of THY were detected in feces [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. For CIN, the quantification in this matrix is complex, so the concentrations of CIN obtained in feces may be inaccurate [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, it has been found that CIN is highly biodegradable [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], a result consistent with the low concentrations observed in other studies [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Pharmacokinetics of the major GAO components, DADS and DATS, assessing their concentrations in the stomach, plasma, liver and urine in rats showed that they are eliminated very quickly from the body [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This rapid elimination of the major GAO compounds could explain why no residues were found in the excrement in our experiments. The bioavailability of both major organosulfur compounds of GAO has been improved by entrapping these active compounds in microformulations, including pegylated liposomes and microemulsions [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Similar results were obtained with microcapsules of CIN [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and corncob granules of THY and CVR [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In the case of NEXT ENHANCE<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 150 and NEXT ENHANCE<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 300, a microencapsulation system (NaturCoat<sup>&#x02122;</sup>) is used, ensuring controlled release in the digestive tract for optimal bioavailability of active compounds.</p><p>Here, we highlight that no alternative antiparasitic should be released for organic farming unless previous standardized ecotoxicity tests confirm its safety for nontarget fauna at sublethal and lethal levels, as well as for the concentrations of residues in the excrement. For example, THY and CVR are toxic to the larval stages of the lesser mealworm beetle <italic toggle="yes">Alphitobius diaperinus</italic> (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], the beet armyworm <italic toggle="yes">Spodoptera exigua</italic> (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), and the planthopper <italic toggle="yes">Pochazia shantungensis</italic> (Hemiptera: Ricaniidae) [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. CIN is toxic to the citrus flatid planthopper <italic toggle="yes">Metcalfa pruinosa</italic> (Hemiptera: Flatidae) [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], reduces food consumption and growth in larval stages of the red flour beetle <italic toggle="yes">Tribolium castaneum</italic> (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and has a repellent effect on the maize weevil <italic toggle="yes">Sitophilus zeamais</italic> (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Furthermore, GAO insecticidal activity was described against the pear psyllid <italic toggle="yes">Cacopsylla chinensis</italic> (Hemiptera: Psyllidae) [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and this compound is also toxic to the mealworm beetle <italic toggle="yes">Tenebrio molitor</italic> (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Our results show that none of the phytochemical compounds have ecotoxic effects on the dung beetle <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">cicatricosus</italic>, even at extremely high concentrations, including those almost 1000 times higher than what is most likely to be found in dung susceptible to being ingested by dung beetles. Thus, we can conclude that the four selected phytochemical compounds meet the requirements to be considered reliable alternatives to ecotoxic veterinary medicinal products, such as ivermectin.</p><p>These results are especially relevant given the new Regulation (EU) 2019/6 of the European Union on veterinary medicinal products. The Commission shall make a legislative proposal to introduce a simplified system for registering traditional phytochemical products used to treat animals, including the obligation to carry out pharmacological, toxicological and residue and safety tests of all chemical compounds and the obligation of taking into account scientific recommendations of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to minimize the risk of cross-contamination and dissemination of these products in the environment as well as their unintended administration to nontarget animals [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec020"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings of this study highlight the true potential of phytochemical anthelmintics to revolutionize the livestock sector. By promoting the use of these alternatives, we can significantly reduce the damage at different scales that synthetic pharmaceutical anthelmintics represent, particularly for dung beetles and the general natural balance of extensive livestock systems. Non-toxicity to non-target organisms, high safety margins and low residue levels make phytochemical compounds such as thymol, carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde and garlic oil viable options for sustainable and environmentally responsible parasite control in livestock.</p><p>The results of this study open new avenues for ecological and sustainable practices in the livestock sector, ensuring the well-being of both the industry and the environment.</p><p>Additionally, interdisciplinary studies on the effects of feed additives with new natural plant extracts with anthelmintic properties on parasite ecology and livestock health, diet selection and performance, coupled with prior standardized ecotoxicity tests, are necessary to ensure good livestock practices consistent with the Agrifood systems and the One Health vision [<xref rid="pone.0295753.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the staff of Do&#x000f1;ana Biological Reserve (DBR-ICTS) and Do&#x000f1;ana National Park, especially D.
