This report describes the design of a prospective observational study utilizing the standardized epidemiologic investigation toolkit for healthcare-associated links in transmission of NTM among pwCF.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>This is a parallel multi-site study of pwCF who have infections with respiratory NTM isolates and receive healthcare within a common CF Care Center. Participants have a history of one or more NTM positive airway cultures and have been identified as having NTM infections suggestive of a possible outbreak within a single Center, based on NTM isolate genomic analysis. Participants are enrolled in the study over a 3-year period. Primary endpoints are identification of shared healthcare-associated source(s) among pwCF in a Center, identification of healthcare environmental dust and water biofilm NTM isolates that are genetically highly-related to respiratory isolates, and identification of common home of residence watersheds among pwCF infected with clustered isolates. Secondary endpoints include characterization of healthcare-associated transmission and/or acquisition modes and settings as well as description of incidence and prevalence of healthcare-associated environmental NTM species/subspecies by geographical region.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Discussion</title><p>We hypothesize that genetically highly-related isolates of NTM among pwCF cared for at the same Center may arise from healthcare sources including patient-to-patient transmission and/or acquisition from health-care environmental dust and/or water biofilms. This study design utilizes a published, standardized, evidence-based epidemiologic toolkit to facilitate confidential, independent healthcare-associated NTM outbreak investigations within CF Care Centers. This study will facilitate real-time, rapid detection and mitigation of healthcare-associated NTM outbreaks to reduce NTM risk, inform infection prevention and control guidelines, and characterize the prevalence and origin of NTM outbreaks from healthcare-associated patient-to-patient transmission and/or environmental acquisition. This study will systematically characterize human disease causing NTM isolates from serial collection of healthcare environmental dust and water biofilms and define the most common healthcare environmental sources harboring NTM biofilms.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05686837" ext-link-type="uri">NCT05686837</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

Positive cultures for NTM were recovered in one in five pwCF over a 5-year period [<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, gaps remain in the understanding of cystic fibrosis-specific source(s) of infection, modes of transmission, and exposure risks [<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Pulmonary NTM infections are thought to be primarily acquired from NTM-rich natural environmental sources including soil, water, water supply systems, and from aerosols generated by flowing water [<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Environmental risk and climatic factors have also been associated with NTM infections among pwCF [<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. NTM have been recovered from municipal water systems and healthcare facilities [<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. NTM are found in water and in biofilms formed on pipes, with both being implicated in healthcare-associated outbreaks of infection [<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0291910.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Healthcare-associated environmental acquisition and transmission of NTM among pwCF is also a concern among patients and their care teams [<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

The frequency of healthcare-associated transmission of NTM among pwCF is controversial, with studies confirming patient-to-patient transmission [<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0291910.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], others finding little to no evidence of transmission [<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0291910.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and some finding transmission only among sibling pairs [<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0291910.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. While one study concluded that NTM are globally transferred potentially via person-to-person transmission of fomites and aerosols [<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], a U.S. multicenter NTM prevalence study concluded that transmission among pwCF was not implicated in the healthcare setting [<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Prior to 2021, published CF Care Center NTM outbreak investigations were independently designed and implemented, making direct comparisons of findings and conclusions suboptimal. As a first step towards understanding NTM outbreaks among pwCF, the <underline>H</underline>ealthcare-<underline>a</underline>ssociated <underline>l</underline>inks in <underline>t</underline>ransmission of <underline>NTM</underline> (HALT NTM, NCT04024423) study developed an evidence-based epidemiologic investigation toolkit, linked with environmental sampling, watershed analysis, and integrated pan genomic analysis, to standardize investigations of potential healthcare-associated NTM outbreaks within CF Care Centers [<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The HALT NTM Toolkit tests NTM transmission with whole genome sequencing (WGS) to genetically-match isolates between patients and/or environment with supportive evidence of epidemiologic exposure for potential cross-infection [<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0291910.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0291910.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>The parent HALT NTM study was a retrospective parallel multi-site study of pwCF cared for in a single Center who are identified with highly similar respiratory NTM isolates [<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The Colorado National Resource Centers (CO-NRC) biorepository collected non-standardized, voluntarily submitted respiratory isolates from CF Care Centers throughout the U.S. for the purpose of culture, molecular identification, and whole genome sequencing (WGS). Using phylogenomic analysis of samples banked from 2015&#x02013;2020, the CO-NRC identified clusters of NTM isolates, defined as highly similar strains at the genomic level, cultured from two or more pwCF who were cared for at the same Care Center [<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0291910.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, NTM isolates were voluntarily submitted in a non-systematic fashion and did not include all isolates from all patients who cultured positive for NTM at their site. Due to this lack of standardization of NTM isolate submission and collection, identification of highly-related NTM clusters was likely underestimated and was identified months to years after potential transmission occurred, limiting timely infectious disease control and inhibiting implementation of potential mitigation strategies.</p><p>Herein we describe the <underline>P</underline>rospective <underline>h</underline>ealthcare-<underline>a</underline>ssociated <underline>l</underline>inks in <underline>t</underline>ransmission of <underline>NTM</underline> among people with CF (pHALT NTM, NCT05686837) study protocol, which will systematically screen all respiratory samples collected over a four-year period for NTM in participating CF Care Centers. The scientific premise that forms the basis for the proposed research is that with prospective, longitudinal respiratory and environmental NTM sampling, the timeliness and accuracy of outbreak detection as well as real-time detection of the origins and prevalence of healthcare-associated patient-to-patient transmission and/or acquisition of NTM among pwCF can be determined and appropriate mitigation implemented.

If multiple NTM species or subspecies are recovered from a single respiratory sample from a pwCF, all unique isolates of NTM species or subspecies will be analyzed. The CO-NRC will identify highly similar isolates within Centers by analyzing WGS on all NTM respiratory isolates collected and results will be combined with existing isolate data from each center, if available. The following stepwise process will be utilized: 1) An isolate from each NTM positive respiratory culture from pwCF during the study timeframe will be mailed to the National Jewish Health (NJH) Advanced Diagnostics (ADx) laboratory, where the isolates will be collected by an Honest Broker to de-identify all respiratory NTM isolates received for the study. 2) The de-identified NTM isolates will be cultured, banked, and DNA extracted. 3) The CO-NRC will perform WGS on extracted NTM DNA. Briefly, high quality genomic DNA will be packaged in to sequencing libraries using a tegmentation approach from Illumina, Inc, and MiSeq 600 v 3 kits will be used to generate whole genome data for assembly into 40X coverage genomic assemblies to be used for downstream analysis and comparison. 4) The sequenced DNA will be analyzed at the core genome level to determine relatedness, and respiratory isolates will be considered highly-related and falling into a cluster using a SNP threshold of &#x02264;30 for <italic toggle="yes">M</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">abscessus</italic> subspecies and &#x02264;20 for MAC species as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].

All environmental isolates will be analyzed at the core and accessory genome level to determine relatedness to each other and to respiratory isolates. To assess if common NTM acquisition may have occurred outside the healthcare system and could be attributed to common source water exposure in the home environment, home of residence addresses will be analyzed based on watershed distribution [<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0291910.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Sample size</title><p>All U.S. CF Care Centers are eligible for enrollment.

An &#x0201c;overlap&#x0201d; is defined as a healthcare setting where two or more pwCF identified in the cluster received care in the same setting for any period of time within 24 hours, as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. A point instance of overlap is defined as a specific physical space within the healthcare setting where two or more pwCF identified with clustered NTM infections received care [<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>To evaluate all potential opportunities for healthcare-associated NTM transmission between patients, subjects&#x02019; outpatient and inpatient care encounters along with NTM culture data will be plotted in a timeline overlap analysis as described in the parent study [<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. As previously described, subject 1 will be identified as the subject with the longest known isolation of NTM, Subject 2 will be identified as the subject with the second longest isolation of NTM, and so forth.

The clinical significance of a first positive CF NTM culture among pwCF that develop NTM disease is demonstrated in lower baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) at the time of first positive culture as well as an increased rate of decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> in the year preceding the first positive culture [<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. With this understanding, it is reasonable to infer that NTM acquisition may occur up to two years prior to collection of the first positive culture. The end date for the exposure window is the date of sample collection for the highly-related strain that was isolated from Subject 2. Using this approach, the directionality of possible transmission from Subject 1 to Subject 2 can be established, regardless of how many subjects are identified in the cluster. Utilizing the HALT NTM Toolkit, demographic, patient location, microbiological data, and details regarding Center IP&#x00026;C practices will be collected from the EHR, then assembled and managed using REDCap&#x000ae; electronic data captured tools hosted at NJH [<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0291910.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

Methods involving statistical inference will be limited as the primary scope of the study is to determine ordinal levels of likelihood of transmission of NTM from patient-to-patient and environment-to-patient, for the observed patients. At this point, we do not plan to make inference for larger populations, except where noted below.</p><p>Tests of significance will be conducted to help determine whether observed patterns are likely to have occurred under the assumption of a particular mode of transmission (e.g., patient-to-patient transmission, environmental acquisition); such tests will developed using permutation methods. The number of clusters (parent HALT NTM study vs pHALT NTM study) will be compared using a 2-sample Poisson rate test or analogous permutation test, adjusting counts to rates based on length of time periods used for the pre- and post-periods. The same procedure will be used to compare the average number of subjects per cluster between pre- and post-periods, as well as to compare number of subjects contributing to a particular cluster during pre- and post-periods (adjusting for period lengths).</p><p>A timeline for completion of data collection and analysis for a participating Center is shown in <xref rid="pone.0291910.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>.

Every available CF NTM isolate will be analyzed and included along with the prospective study, thus building on all available NTM isolates. Analysis of the individual center data will be completed using both qualitative and quantitative approaches. We will identify a set of variables used to assess degree of proximity of subjects in time and/or space. The first analysis will involve quantifying exposure windows for patients within clusters at a site based on hospital or clinic visits, and use of graphical techniques to help determine plausible transmission settings and transmission windows based on date of conversion and dates of positive culture. Graphical techniques will first be employed to help determine likelihood of patient-to-patient transmission between all pairs of subjects within each cluster. Separate graphs will also be constructed to better understand evidence for potential point-source environmental transmission, as well as potential watershed transmission. Among subjects who have overlapping clinic visits, the degree of physical closeness will be determined and qualitative measures of proximity will be assessed as described in the parent study [<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Analysis of secondary outcomes</title><p>The secondary endpoints are: 1) Adherence to CF IP&#x00026;C guidelines. 2) Characterization of points of patient overlap. 3) Incidence and prevalence of NTM species/subspecies within healthcare dust and water biofilms. 4) Determine if biofilm isolates are highly related to isolates recovered from patients. As described in the parent study [<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], the incidence and prevalence of NTM species and subspecies within healthcare dust and water biofilms will be characterized and comparisons of environmental NTM biofilm isolates and highly-related patient isolates will be provided.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>Interim analyses</title><p>Interim data analyses review will occur semi-annually.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec025"><title>Discussion</title><p>The parent HALT NTM Toolkit facilitates a structured process by which individual CF Care Centers will conduct a standardized, independent, and confidential NTM epidemiologic outbreak investigation of patients identified by the CO-NRC as having clustered NTM infections [<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The pHALT NTM prospective study design will meet the urgent and significant need to promptly identify, investigate, and mitigate suspected healthcare-associated NTM outbreaks among pwCF. The long-term goals are rapid, real-time detection and mitigation of healthcare-associated NTM outbreaks to reduce NTM risk, inform CF IP&#x00026;C guidelines, and assure pwCF that care at their Center is safe. The secondary goals are to assess the prevalence and origin of NTM outbreaks from patient-to-patient transmission and/or healthcare-associated environmental acquisition.</p><p>Currently there is no clear evidence-based benchmark or threshold of NTM transmission among pwCF. Healthcare-associated patient-to-patient transmission and/or environmental acquisition of NTM may vary among Centers based on variations in the implementation of IP&#x00026;C measures within an individual Center, as well as nuances in the endemic environmental NTM burden and physical layout and design of the healthcare setting that is unique to each institution. Based on published data [<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0291910.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], we are reassured that healthcare-associated NTM acquisition and transmission are very low in Colorado with only one of 11 clusters demonstrating both evidence of epidemiologically plausible opportunity for healthcare-associated transmission and stringent isolated relatedness criteria (&#x02264;10 SNP differences and &#x02265;95% shared accessory genome). In Vermont [<xref rid="pone.0291910.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], healthcare-associated patient-to-patient transmission of NTM, specifically <italic toggle="yes">M</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">chimaera</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">M</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">avium</italic>, was not found. However, this investigation supports healthcare-associated environmental <italic toggle="yes">M</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">chimaera</italic> acquisition based on 8 of 9 clustered respiratory isolates having a genetic match with a hospital water fountain isolate. Data from other enrolled Centers are currently undergoing analysis, but it is clear based on preliminary data, epidemiologic findings, and environmental NTM exposure for healthcare-associated transmission and/or acquisition varies among Centers. The pHALT NTM study will be impactful, even if no healthcare-associated transmission and/or acquisition of NTM is observed among pwCF because negative results would validate the current IP&#x00026;C guidelines. The pHALT NTM study will analyze IP&#x00026;C measures within each healthcare setting, including use of masks, changes directed toward decreasing patient interactions with healthcare setting water sources, and other recommendations for interactions among pwCF in the healthcare setting.</p><p>We recognize that the pHALT NTM study does not include evaluation of free water and soil in the healthcare-associated setting, and also does not include environmental sampling of home and other non-healthcare environmental sources. Although additional healthcare environmental sampling and home environmental sampling are both interesting and may be important, these investigations are beyond the scope of this study. A household-specific study protocol to perform direct dust and water biofilm sampling of homes of pwCF infected with NTM may be an avenue of future research.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We appreciate the support of National Jewish Health, Colorado Adult CF Program and the Respiratory Institute at Saint Joseph Hospital.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0291910.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Qvist</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Pressler</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hoiby</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Katzenstein</surname><given-names>TL</given-names></name>. <article-title>Shifting paradigms of nontuberculous mycobacteria in cystic fibrosis.</article-title>
