Expression of <italic>Glomeris dpp </italic>(<italic>Gm-dpp</italic>) is found at the tip of the trunk legs as well as weakly along the dorsal side of the legs in early stages. Taking data from other arthropods into account, these results may be interpreted in favor of a conserved mode of WG/DPP signaling. Apart from the main PD axis, many arthropod appendages have additional branches (e.g. endites). It is debated whether these extra branches develop their PD axis via the same mechanism as the main PD axis, or whether branch-specific mechanisms exist.

Both genes encode secreted morphogens that generate combinatorial gradients across the developing imaginal leg discs (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]). These gradients form the top level in a PD axis patterning cascade and they control expression of the genes at the next level of the cascade, the leg-gap genes (e.g. <italic>Distal-less </italic>(<italic>Dll</italic>), <italic>dachshund </italic>(<italic>dac</italic>)) (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]). Thus, <italic>wg </italic>and <italic>dpp </italic>are key factors involved in the early events of PD axis formation.</p><p>In recent years several comparative studies in other arthropod species have suggested that the action of the leg-gap genes in PD patterning is evolutionarily conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Tus, the question arose as to whether the regulation of the leg-gap genes by the WG/DPP morphogen gradient is also conserved. The currently available data provide no clear answer. Initially, the expression patterns did not support the conservation of this top level of the PD axis patterning cascade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Other authors, however, have argued in favor of a conservation of WG/DPP morphogen signaling in PD axis formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, many arthropods have appendages with more than one PD axis. It is currently debated whether these multiple axes are all patterned by a cascade involving <italic>wg </italic>and <italic>dpp </italic>at the top level, or whether the different branches are patterned through branch-specific mechanisms.</p><p>The comparative analyses of <italic>wg </italic>and <italic>dpp </italic>expression during appendage formation to date mainly focus on insects (e.g. <italic>Tribolium</italic>, <italic>Gryllus</italic>, <italic>Schistocerca</italic>, <italic>Athalia </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]). Only a few representatives of the crustaceans and chelicerates have been studied from other arthropod classes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Here, I report on results concerning <italic>wg </italic>and <italic>dpp </italic>expression in the appendages of a representative of the fourth extant arthropod class, the myriapod <italic>Glomeris marginata</italic>. The <italic>wg </italic>gene of <italic>Glomeris </italic>is expressed on the ventral side of the appendages compatible with a conserved role in PD axis development. Additionally, Glomeris <italic>wg </italic>may induce expression of the genes <italic>Dll </italic>and <italic>H15 </italic>in the sensory organs of the mouthparts. The results with the <italic>Glomeris dpp </italic>gene are more ambiguous. Although the data can be interpreted in favor of a conservation of the WG/DPP morphogen gradients, clearly more work on the subject is necessary to clarify the evolution of PD axis patterning in arthropod appendages. In particular, it will be necessary to elucidate the mechanisms through which the additional PD axes in multibranched appendages are patterned.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Cloning of <italic>Gm-dpp </italic>cDNA fragments</title><p>A fragment of a <italic>Glomeris </italic>gene that shows sequence similarity to members of the TGF-beta gene family was isolated. In order to establish the orthology of this fragment, I performed a phylogenetic analysis incorporating a selection of TGF-beta proteins from <italic>Drosophila</italic>, other arthropods and a variety of deuterostome taxa. The resulting phylogenetic tree distinguishes two groups of proteins. One group comprises the arthropod <italic>dpp </italic>genes and their deuterostome homologs, the BMP2/4 genes. The second group consists of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>TGF-beta genes <italic>screw </italic>(<italic>scw</italic>) and <italic>glass bottom boat </italic>(<italic>gbb</italic>), and the remaining deuterostome BMP genes with TGF-beta homology, including zebrafish <italic>anti dorsalizing morphogenetic protein </italic>(ADMP). The <italic>Glomeris </italic>fragment resides in the <italic>dpp</italic>/BMP2/4 group and is therefore designated as <italic>Gm-dpp </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The resolution within the <italic>dpp</italic>/BMP2/4 group is low, with many nodes lacking statistical support. The <italic>Glomeris </italic>fragment forms a group together with <italic>dpp </italic>from the two-spotted cricket (<italic>Gryllus bimaculatus</italic>) and BMP2/4 from the yellow acorn worm (<italic>Ptychodera flava</italic>). However, support for this grouping is not statistically significant (reliability value = 27). A higher resolution of the <italic>dpp</italic>/BMP2/4 group may be achieved in the future by the aquisition of additional sequence information.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Phylogenetic analysis of the <italic>Glomeris dpp </italic>fragment.

It is known that the neuroectoderm of each hemisegment is divided into a dorsal, medial and ventral portion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Judging from its expression, it is possible that <italic>Gm-dpp </italic>has a role in the development of the dorsal portion of the neuroectoderm. A role in the developing ventral portion is also possible, since <italic>Gm-dpp </italic>is transiently expressed along the ventral midline (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>; arrows). A further expression domain in the central nervous system is seen in the area of the developing optic centers of the brain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C,2D,2E</xref>; arrows).</p><p>Starting with stage 4, <italic>Gm-dpp </italic>is expressed along the external rim of the germband in tissue that will later form the heart (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D,2E</xref>; arrowheads). Later on, segmentally repeated patches of weak <italic>Gm-dpp </italic>expression appear on the dorsal side of the embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>; arrowheads). These patches are presumably also correlated with the developing heart of the embryos. Finally, expression of <italic>Gm-dpp </italic>is found in the stomodaeum, and very weakly in the proctodaeum.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression profile of <italic>Gm-dpp </italic>during appendage development</title><p>The appendages buds show weak expression of <italic>Gm-dpp </italic>at the very beginning of their formation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,2B</xref>). Later on, different appendages display appendage-specific expression patterns. In the trunk legs, the strongest expression is seen at the leg tips. In early developmental stages the expression fills almost the entire tip, and the border against the ventral portion of the legs (which is devoid of expression) is rather distinct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). There is also expression of <italic>Gm-dpp </italic>along the dorsal side of the trunk legs, but this is visibly weaker than the expression in the leg tips. The expression at the leg tips is clearly confined to the dorsal side of the tip in legs of stage 5 embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>), while the expression along the dorsal side persists, but becomes weaker and diffuse. Finally, expression of <italic>Gm-dpp </italic>in the legs vanishes almost completely at stage 6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3I</xref>). The dorsal expression is virtually undetectable, and only a few cells express <italic>Gm-dpp </italic>at the tip.</p><p>In the maxilla there are two expression domains of <italic>Gm-dpp</italic>, a dorsal and a ventral one (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). The ventral domain is located on the internal side at the base of the maxilla. This domain slowly vanishes during development (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>) and finally disappears around stage 6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3J</xref>). The dorsal expression domain runs along the dorsal edge of the base of the maxilla (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B,3F</xref>). This domain also gradually disappears during development, and at stage 6.1 only a faint dorsal expression is detectable (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3J</xref>).</p><p>In the mandible, a dorsal expression domain that runs along the entire dorsal rim of the appendage is visible (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Later on, however, this expression is restricted to the basal portion of the mandible and has a distinct border against the external lobe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>). Additional expression domains are detectable at later stages within the external lobe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3K</xref>; asterisk) in addition to the internal side of the internal lobe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G,3K</xref>; arrow).</p><p>In the antenna, <italic>Gm-dpp </italic>is expressed in the dorsal half of the appendage with a distinct border against the non-expressing ventral half (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). In addition, a patch of weaker <italic>Gm-dpp </italic>expression is located on the ventral side of the antenna (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>; square). Another patch of <italic>Gm-dpp </italic>expression is visible at the transition between the antennal base and the neuroectoderm of the antennal neuromere (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>; asterisk). The latter two patches of expression disappear during the further course of development. By stage 5 the ventral spot has disappeared completely, and the patch at the antennal base is virtually gone as well (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3H</xref>). Similar to the other appendages at stage 6.1, the level of <italic>Gm-dpp </italic>expression has also significantly decreased, though one can discern three specific expression domains at this stage. There are two groups of cells (at the tip and at the base of the antenna) weakly expressing <italic>Gm-dpp </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3L</xref>; arrow and asterisk, respectively), and a ring of cells at the distal third of the antenna, where <italic>Gm-dpp </italic>expression is even weaker (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3L</xref>; square).</p></sec><sec><title>Expression profile of <italic>Gm-wg </italic>during appendage development</title><p>The expression of <italic>Gm-wg </italic>during germ band segmentation, neurogenesis, and the development of the digestive system has already been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Here, I focus on <italic>Gm-wg </italic>expression during the development of the appendages. Before the onset of limb development, <italic>Gm-wg </italic>is expressed in a stripe in each hemisegment. This stripe is located approximately in the middle of the segment and runs across the neuroectoderm and the presumptive appendage tissue. Comparison to the expression of <italic>engrailed </italic>(<italic>Gm-en</italic>) has shown that the stripe of <italic>Gm-wg </italic>expression abuts the parasegment border and, thus, is located in cells of the anterior segmental compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The buds of the appendages form from the tissue at the external ends of the <italic>Gm-wg </italic>stripes. Preparations of complete hemisegments of stage 3 embryos show, that expression of <italic>Gm-wg </italic>extends more or less contiguously across the neuroectoderm into the forming limb buds in all four different appendage types (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A,4B,4C,4D</xref>). The extent to which the expression reaches into the limb buds varies depending on the appendage type. In the antennal bud the expression of <italic>Gm-wg </italic>is restricted to the ventral side (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). In the maxillary and mandibulary buds expression includes larger areas, approximately two thirds of the buds (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B,4C</xref>). Finally, expression is most extensive in the buds of the trunk legs: almost the entire buds express <italic>Gm-wg </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Expression of <italic>Gm-wg </italic>during appendage development.

The expression is contiguous from the base of the legs to the tips, but the level of expression is somewhat heterogeneous. The strongest expression is seen near the base and in the distal part of the legs, while expression is visibly weaker between these parts. A similar phenomenon is present in the antenna (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4H,4L,4P,4T</xref>), where expression is restricted to the ventral side of the antenna and the level of expression at the distal end is much stronger than in more proximal parts. However, unlike the pattern in the legs, the intensity of expression at the base of the antenna is not increased.</p><p>The maxilla displays a rather dynamic expression profile of <italic>Gm-wg</italic>. Beginning at stage 4 the gene is expressed along the ventral edge of the maxilla (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>). Three domains can be distinguished that are not completely separated. The innermost domain is more diffuse than the other two domains and at stage 5 separates into two separate patches of expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4J,4N,4R</xref>; two-headed arrow). The two other domains remain separate during the development of the maxillary appendage and are reminiscent of the expression pattern of <italic>Gm-Dll </italic>(see below).</p><p>In the mandible, a similar fragmentation of the initial mostly homogeneous expression pattern takes place. In the external lobe the expression is strong throughout and is separated from the expression domain in the internal lobe by an area of very weak expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G,4K,4O,4S</xref>). The expression domain in the internal lobe splits (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4K</xref>), then retracts from the tip of the lobe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4O</xref>) and decreases in expression strength (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4S</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of <italic>Gm-wg </italic>and <italic>Gm-Dll </italic>in the gnathal sensory organs</title><p>As mentioned above, the expression pattern of <italic>Gm-wg </italic>in the maxilla is reminiscent of the pattern described for <italic>Gm-Dll </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and at first glance both patterns appear virtually identical. The <italic>Gm-Dll </italic>gene is expressed in the primordia of the maxillary sensory organs. Expression of the <italic>Gm-wg </italic>gene, however, is at least partially complementary to the pattern of <italic>Gm-Dll</italic>. In older stages, strong expression of <italic>Gm-wg </italic>is not detected within the primordia of the sensory organs, but rather it surrounds the primordia (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4R</xref>). In preparations simultaneously labeled with probes against <italic>Gm-wg </italic>and <italic>Gm-Dll </italic>the composite expression pattern stains the entire internal side of the maxilla (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A,5C</xref>), indicating that both patterns complement each other. However, the maxillary expression of <italic>Gm-wg </italic>in three (later four) domains is more extensive than the more restricted expression pattern of <italic>Gm-Dll </italic>in two (later three) well-defined stripes (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]). Therefore, the expression patterns are certainly not mutually exclusive. The presumed overlap of the two expression patterns, however, cannot be detected with the double labeling technique used here.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>The relation between the expression of <italic>Gm-wg </italic>and <italic>Gm-Dll</italic>.

In preparations of mandibles labeled with a cocktail of probes against both genes no significant difference to the pattern of <italic>Gm-wg </italic>alone is observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B,5D</xref>), indicating that the <italic>Gm-Dll </italic>pattern is entirely included in the <italic>Gm-wg </italic>pattern.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><sec><title>Establishment of the primary PD axis</title><p>In <italic>Drosophila dpp </italic>is expressed in a narrow dorsal sector in the leg imaginal discs, whereas <italic>wg </italic>is expressed in a similar sector on the ventral side (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]). Together these two genes generate morphogen gradients in the developing leg imaginal discs. These gradients are utilized by several genes to guide the development of the PD axis of the leg imaginal discs. Evolutionary developmental studies have shown that the expression of <italic>wg </italic>homologs along the ventral side of the appendages is highly conserved in the arthropods (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]). In contrast, <italic>dpp </italic>expression differs from the expression pattern found in <italic>Drosophila </italic>in all arthropods studied thus far (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]). At early stages expression of arthropod <italic>dpp </italic>homologs is restricted to the leg tip, while at later stages expression rings of unclear significance appear in some species. Despite these differences in expression, it has been argued that the combined action of the WG and DPP morphogen gradients is conserved, and that the differences in expression of <italic>dpp </italic>are correlated with the differences in the mode of leg development between <italic>Drosophila </italic>(via imaginal discs) and most other arthropods (normal leg outgrowth) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The data from <italic>Glomeris </italic>presented here may be interpreted in favor of this hypothesis. The <italic>Gm-wg </italic>gene is expressed along the ventral side in the legs and <italic>Gm-dpp </italic>is expressed most strongly in the leg tips. Taking these expression loci as the sources of <italic>Gm</italic>-WG and <italic>Gm</italic>-DPP protein, the resulting hypothetical protein gradients would facilitate PD patterning events similar to the ones in the <italic>Drosophila </italic>leg discs (see also Fig. 11 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]). However, <italic>Gm-dpp </italic>is weakly expressed along the dorsal leg side. This is similar to the <italic>Drosophila </italic>situation, but is contrary to the predictions of the above hypothesis since <italic>Glomeris </italic>does not develop the legs via flat imaginal discs and therefore should show a <italic>dpp </italic>expression pattern typical of directly developing legs rather than a pattern similar to <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The fact that <italic>Gm-dpp </italic>is also weakly expressed along the dorsal side of the legs may be explained by several possibilities. It may be argued that the dorsal expression is so weak that it has no significant influence on the shape of the <italic>Gm</italic>-DPP protein gradient, which would therefore mainly be dependent on the morphogen source at the tip. It is also possible that the dorsal expression is unrelated to PD axis formation and instead functions during DV axis formation (see below).</p><p>In any case, the picture emerging from the available data on <italic>dpp </italic>expression in arthropods is that the dorsal sector in <italic>Drosophila </italic>seems to be an exception rather than the rule. The hypothesis proposed by Prpic et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] attempts to explain this by the differences in leg architecture between <italic>Drosophila </italic>and most other arthropod species. However, according to their hypothesis, the presence of combinatorial protein gradients is conserved. It should be pointed out in this context that the existence of a DPP gradient (or a WG gradient for that matter) has yet to be demonstrated in an arthropod other than <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Thus, although the expression data may be interpreted as the PD axis patterning using WG/DPP signaling being conserved among arthropods, it is obvious that comparative expression analyses alone cannot answer the question satisfactorily. It must now be considered whether experiments capable of demonstrating WG/DPP signaling during leg development in arthropods other than <italic>Drosophila </italic>may be conceived.</p></sec><sec><title>Establishment of secondary PD axes</title><p>Aside from the primary PD axis, many arthropods have limbs with additional branches (rami). It has been proposed that these additional rami are patterned in the same way as the main branch, simply by duplications of the WG/DPP signaling system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Recent results from the study of insect mouthparts argue against this notion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The insect labium and maxilla have ventral branches (endites) that apparently do not utilize a combinatorial WG/DPP gradient system to guide their outgrowth. A similar conclusion has been reached by a study of the development of crustacean multibranched appendages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The presence of endites in the mouthparts of myriapods is unclear, mainly because of the modified morphology of the adult gnathalia. Certain elements of the centipede mandible and first maxilla are probably derived from endites (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]) and there are attempts to assign parts of the diplopod mandible as homologous to crustacean or insect endites (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]). Indeed, the embryonic mandible and maxilla in <italic>Glomeris </italic>develop ventral lobes that are very reminiscent of the endite lobes of the embryonic mouthparts in insects. The exclusive ventral origin of these lobes is further corroborated by the lack of expression of the dorsal marker <italic>optomotor-blind </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, the <italic>Glomeris </italic>lobes possess <italic>Dll</italic>-positive sensory organs, which is typical of arthropod endites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Thus, although the interpretation of the millipede mouthparts is disputed (see e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]), these ventral lobes are likely homologous to the endites present in insect mouthparts.</p><p>The embryonic <italic>Glomeris </italic>mandible develops two lobes, the internal and external mandibular lobe. Both lobes express <italic>Gm-dpp</italic>, but not at a position suggestive of a role in PD axis formation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). In addition, the expression domain in the external mandibular lobe appears after the lobe has already grown and is therefore unlikely to be involved in PD outgrowth. The development of the maxillae is more complex. They start out as separate appendages, but around stage 6 the left and the right maxilla fuse along their internal sides (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A,6B</xref>). Each maxilla has a single lobe, containing the primordia of three sensory organs that can also be visualized by <italic>Gm-Dll </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The two external sensory organ primordia form the lobus medius and the lobus exterior in the adult (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] for a detailed description of <italic>Glomeris </italic>maxillary morphology). These two sensory structures grow from the internal side of the stipes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). The internal sensory organ primordium is different from the other two in the sense that it will not end up on the stipes, but will form the lobus interior that grows from the lamella lingualis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). The lamellae linguales of the right and left maxilla fuse around stage 6 to form the intermaxillary plate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). The single lobe in the <italic>Glomeris </italic>embryonic maxilla therefore has a rather complex fate in the adult mouthpart (the gnathochilarium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]). The portion of the maxillary lobe that will give rise to the stipes expresses <italic>Gm-dpp </italic>at only later stages when the expression along the dorsal side of the maxillary base is extending weakly into the stipes. The portion forming the lamella lingualis also expresses <italic>Gm-dpp</italic>, but at its internal edge, a location hardly suggesting a role in PD outgrowth of the maxillary lobe.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Possible endite homologs in the mouthparts of <italic>Glomeris</italic>.

Similar results have been obtained recently for the endites in the grasshopper <italic>Schistocerca </italic>and the beetle <italic>Tribolium </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In <italic>Schistocerca </italic>at least one endite (the galea) grows without <italic>dpp </italic>expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>), and in <italic>Tribolium </italic>both maxillary endites lack detectable <italic>dpp </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This indicates that the development of the PD axis of the endites does not generally require the WG/DPP morphogen system.</p></sec><sec><title>Relation of <italic>wingless </italic>and <italic>dpp </italic>expression to DV axis formation</title><p>A second role of <italic>wg </italic>and <italic>dpp </italic>in <italic>Drosophila </italic>is the activation of some factors involved in DV axis formation in the legs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. <italic>wg</italic>, being expressed along the ventral side, is an instructor of ventral fate, whereas <italic>dpp </italic>is expressed on the dorsal side and establishes dorsal fates. The primary factors controlled by <italic>wg </italic>and <italic>dpp </italic>are <italic>H15 </italic>on the ventral side and <italic>omb </italic>on the dorsal side. These factors have been recently studied in <italic>Glomeris </italic>and in a spider (<italic>Cupiennius salei</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The expression patterns suggest that the role of <italic>omb </italic>as dorsal instructor is evolutionarily conserved, but <italic>H15 </italic>does not seem to be a general ventralizing factor in all arthropods. Thus, the dorsal, but not the ventral developmental mechanisms seem to be conserved. It is interesting that the expression data of <italic>wg </italic>and <italic>dpp </italic>suggest that the opposite is true. The <italic>wg </italic>expression on the ventral side is highly conserved among the arthropods, but the <italic>dpp </italic>patterns differ between species and in most part expression is not localized to the entire dorsal side. This paradox clearly demonstrates the limited understanding of the evolution of DV axis formation in arthropod appendages.</p></sec><sec><title>Patterning of appendicular sensory organs</title><p>The maxilla of <italic>Glomeris </italic>has several sensory organs. Recent studies have identified the genes <italic>Dll</italic>, <italic>dac </italic>and <italic>H15</italic>, which show a restricted expression pattern in the primordia of the maxillary sensory organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Two of these genes, <italic>Dll </italic>and <italic>H15</italic>, are known from <italic>Drosophila </italic>to be activated upon signaling through the <italic>wingless </italic>pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. It is interesting to note that expression of <italic>Gm-wg </italic>surrounds the sensory primordia in the <italic>Glomeris </italic>maxilla. It may therefore be the case that cells expressing <italic>Gm-wg </italic>in the surrounding of the primordia signal to their neighbors within the primordia and stimulate them to activate <italic>Gm-Dll </italic>and <italic>Gm-H15</italic>. Minimally the activation of <italic>Dll </italic>appears to be a general feature of appendicular sensory organs in arthropods since <italic>Dll </italic>expression has been observed in appendicular sensory organs in chelicerates, crustaceans, myriapods and insects (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]). Moreover, data from <italic>Drosophila </italic>suggest that <italic>Dll </italic>expression is critically required for sensory organ formation, as mutants lacking <italic>Dll </italic>fail to develop Keilin's organs (the sensory structures of the embryonic leg anlagen) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The expression of <italic>Gm-wg </italic>and <italic>Gm-dpp </italic>during appendage development indicates a role for both genes in guiding this process. Involvement of <italic>wg </italic>and <italic>dpp </italic>in appendage development appears to be conserved among all extant arthropod classes including myriapods. The data from <italic>Glomeris </italic>and other arthropods suggest that the WG/DPP morphogen signaling system as it is known from <italic>Drosophila </italic>leg discs is present in all arthropods. However, this morphogen system apparently functions in only the main branch of the appendages, the so-called telopodite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Limb types with additional branches (e.g. endites) obviously use additional, yet unidentified mechanisms to organize proximal-distal growth of the extra branches. Gene expression in potential endite homologs present in <italic>Glomeris </italic>mouthparts supports this notion. Aside from the role in PD axis formation, the expression profile of <italic>Gm-wg </italic>suggests an additional role for this gene in patterning appendicular sensory organs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animal stocks</title><p>Animals were collected during Spring 2003 in beech forests in the vicinity of Cologne, Germany and near Kranenburg, Germany.

Additional sequence information was gained by RACE PCR. No full-length fragment could be obtained and several artificial clones were encountered, probably representing chimeric products resulting from jumping PCR between different TGF-beta-like cDNAs.
