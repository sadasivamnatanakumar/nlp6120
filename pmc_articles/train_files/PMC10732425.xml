The <italic toggle="yes">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> quorum sensing network consists of multiple interconnected transcriptional regulators, with the transcription factor, RhlR, acting as one of the main drivers of quorum sensing behaviors. RhlR is a LuxR-type transcription factor that regulates its target genes when bound to its cognate autoinducer, C<sub>4</sub>-homoserine lactone, which is synthesized by RhlI. RhlR function is also regulated by the metallo-&#x003b2;-hydrolase enzyme, PqsE. We recently showed that PqsE binds RhlR to alter its affinity for promoter DNA, a new mechanism of quorum-sensing receptor activation. Here, we perform ChIP-seq analyses of RhlR to map the binding of RhlR across the <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aeruginosa</italic> genome, and to determine the impact of C<sub>4</sub>-homoserine lactone and PqsE on RhlR binding to different sites across the <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aeruginosa</italic> genome. We identify 40 RhlR binding sites, all but three of which are associated with genes known to be regulated by RhlR. C<sub>4</sub>-homoserine lactone is required for maximal binding of RhlR to many of its DNA sites. Moreover, C<sub>4</sub>-homoserine lactone is required for maximal RhlR-dependent transcription activation from all sites, regardless of whether it impacts RhlR binding to DNA. PqsE is required for maximal binding of RhlR to many DNA sites, with similar effects on RhlR-dependent transcription activation from those sites. However, the effects of PqsE on RhlR specificity are distinct from those of C<sub>4</sub>-homoserine lactone, and PqsE is sufficient for RhlR binding to some DNA sites in the absence of C<sub>4</sub>-homoserine lactone. Together, C<sub>4</sub>-homoserine lactone and PqsE are required for RhlR binding at the large majority of its DNA sites. Thus, our work reveals three distinct modes of activation by RhlR: i) when RhlR is unbound by autoinducer but bound by PqsE, ii) when RhlR is bound by autoinducer but not bound by PqsE, and iii) when RhlR is bound by both autoinducer and PqsE, establishing a stepwise mechanism for the progression of the RhlR-RhlI-PqsE quorum sensing pathway in <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aeruginosa</italic>.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p><italic toggle="yes">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> represents a serious threat to public health in the United States because of its intrinsic mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance. One of the primary drivers of its antimicrobial resistance profile is biofilm formation. Biofilms are multicellular communities that are formed in an ordered mechanism by the collective. In the case of <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aeruginosa</italic>, biofilm formation is controlled by a cell-cell communication process called quorum sensing. Quorum sensing underpins transcriptional changes in a bacterium, allowing for the transition from individual, planktonic behaviors to group, sessile behaviors. Group behaviors are behaviors that are only beneficial to engage in once a critical threshold of kin population is reached. The transition to group behaviors is mediated by quorum sensing through an interconnected regulatory system, with the transcription factor receptor RhlR regulating the expression of hundreds of genes. RhlR-dependent transcription relies on the detection of a ligand produced by its partner synthase, RhlI, and an accessory binding protein that alters its affinity for promoter DNA, PqsE, resulting in a dual regulatory mechanism that was not previously observed in quorum sensing. The main goal of this study was to determine the molecular basis for promoter selection by RhlR using bacterial genetics and DNA-based sequencing methods for measuring site-specific protein binding. Our approach established the entirety of the RhlR direct regulon and the contributions of each of the known regulators to RhlR-dependent promoter binding and gene regulation.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

Homologous to LasI/R, RhlI synthesizes the AI <italic toggle="yes">N</italic>-butyryl-L-homoserine lactone (C<sub>4</sub>HSL), which binds the transcription factor receptor RhlR. Both systems function in a positive feedback manner with the receptor upregulating the transcription of its partner synthase, thus maximizing the transcriptional response of the system [<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. LasR and RhlR regulate the transcription of hundreds of genes, both directly and indirectly [<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Each transcription factor has its own regulon, with a subset of genes co-regulated by both systems. LasR and RhlR co-regulate a third QS pathway, the <italic toggle="yes">Pseudomonas</italic> quinolone signaling (PQS) system [<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. LasR upregulates the transcription of <italic toggle="yes">pqsR</italic>. PqsR is a LysR transcription factor receptor that binds to the AI 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4(1<italic toggle="yes">H</italic>)-quinolone (PQS), which is produced by the biosynthetic pathway enzymes encoded by the <italic toggle="yes">pqsABCDE</italic> operon and <italic toggle="yes">pqsH</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Similar to the Las and Rhl system, PqsR upregulates the transcription of genes involved in the synthesis of its AI, thereby establishing another positive feedback loop, resulting in a fully activated QS network [<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. RhlR transcriptionally represses the <italic toggle="yes">pqsABCDE</italic> operon, highlighting the interconnected regulatory mechanisms that govern the progression of QS in <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aeruginosa</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. PqsE is a metallo-&#x003b2;-hydrolase enzyme encoded in the <italic toggle="yes">pqsABCDE</italic> operon and is involved in PQS synthesis. Recent work from our group and others has shown that PqsE plays a more nuanced role in QS signaling, outside of its role as an enzyme in the PQS biosynthetic pathway [<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Moreover, PqsE is dispensable for the production of PQS, as the deletion of <italic toggle="yes">pqsE</italic> results in wild-type (WT) levels of PQS [<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>Distinct from its role as an enzyme, PqsE plays an important role in the production of virulence factors; deletion of <italic toggle="yes">pqsE</italic> results in a failure of the strain to produce pyocyanin, an important virulence factor that is produced in a QS-dependent manner via the regulation of the paralogous <italic toggle="yes">phzABCDEFG1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">phzABCDEFG2</italic> operons as well as <italic toggle="yes">phzH</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">phzM</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">phzS</italic> [<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Furthermore, pyocyanin production could not be restored by the addition of PQS, indicating a non-enzymatic role for PqsE in the regulation of pyocyanin production [<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. We recently discovered that PqsE physically interacts with RhlR to regulate the ability of RhlR to bind DNA and, thus, contributes to the regulation of pyocyanin production [<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. More globally, RNA-seq experiments revealed that the PqsE interaction with RhlR and C<sub>4</sub>HSL-bound RhlR contribute to RhlR-dependent gene regulation in an overlapping manner, with a few notable exceptions [<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. For example, the gene encoding rhamnolipid synthase, <italic toggle="yes">rhlA</italic>, is regulated by RhlR in a C<sub>4</sub>HSL-dependent manner, with PqsE exerting only a minor influence on its transcription. Conversely, the gene encoding hydrogen cyanide synthase, <italic toggle="yes">hcnA</italic>, is regulated by RhlR in a PqsE-dependent manner, with C<sub>4</sub>HSL exerting only a minor influence on its transcription. RNA-seq analyses revealed that these two examples occur on the far ends of a wide spectrum of RhlR-dependent regulation. To date, the RhlR regulon has been inferred from gene expression analyses [<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Thus, it is unknown which genes are directly regulated by RhlR promoter binding. Moreover, the dependence of RhlR on PqsE and C<sub>4</sub>HSL for binding different DNA sites has not been determined. Here, we perform ChIP-seq analyses of RhlR in different genetic backgrounds to comprehensively map genes that are directly regulated by RhlR in <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aeruginosa</italic>. We also assess the different and overlapping contributions of C<sub>4</sub>HSL and PqsE to RhlR-dependent regulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Identification of 40 RhlR binding sites across the <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aeruginosa</italic> PA14 genome</title><p>Previous studies identified RhlR-regulated genes but could not determine the direct RhlR-mediated regulation due to the lack of binding data [<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].

To account for the possibility that the antibody binds proteins other than RhlR, we performed a parallel ChIP-seq experiment in a &#x00394;<italic toggle="yes">rhlR</italic> strain. Of the 168 genomic regions enriched in ChIP-seq with the WT strain (<xref rid="pgen.1010900.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>), 40 had decreased enrichment in the &#x00394;<italic toggle="yes">rhlR</italic> strain (<xref rid="pgen.1010900.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). We consider these 40 regions to be true RhlR-bound regions (<xref rid="pgen.1010900.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; see methods for details). We speculate that the other 128 regions are not RhlR-bound. Indeed, many of these 128 regions are known MvaT/U binding sites, suggesting that their enrichment in the RhlR ChIP-seq was due to cross-reactivity of the RhlR antibody with MvaT and/or MvaU [<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p><p>The 40 RhlR-bound regions we identified include many with well-established RhlR regulatory elements, such as <italic toggle="yes">rhlA</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">hcnA</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">phzA1</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1010900.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A&#x02013;1C</xref>) [<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].

We note that neither we, nor others in the field, have purified WT RhlR bound to its native AI. Instead, we solubilized and purified RhlR in the presence of the synthetic agonist meta-bromothiolactone (mBTL), as previously described [<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. mBTL behaves identically to C<sub>4</sub>HSL in cell-based reporter assays [<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].

Our findings are largely consistent with prior studies that focused on RhlR-dependent changes in RNA levels [<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], but our data help to distinguish direct from indirect regulation. Moreover, apparent inconsistencies in RNA-seq data between studies, and the presence of RhlR binding sites upstream of genes without apparent RhlR-dependent changes in RNA levels, suggest that direct regulation of some genes by RhlR is condition-specific, requiring additional factors. Most genes in the direct RhlR regulon have established roles in QS. Direct RhlR regulation of several uncharacterized genes, such as <italic toggle="yes">PA14_59180</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PA14_22090</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">PA14_10360</italic>, strongly suggests a role for these genes in QS. Regarding the role of PqsE, our data are also largely consistent with an RNA-seq study that assessed the effect of RhlR and PqsE on transcript levels genome-wide [<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, the majority of RhlR-regulated and PqsE-regulated genes are likely to be indirectly regulated, highlighting the value of combining RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data.</p><p>Both C<sub>4</sub>HSL and PqsE contribute to RhlR-dependent transcription activation, but to varying degrees depending on the RhlR site. In the absence of both C<sub>4</sub>HSL and PqsE, RhlR binding to DNA was abolished for almost all sites (<xref rid="pgen.1010900.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1010900.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>), resulting in no RhlR-dependent gene activation (<xref rid="pgen.1010900.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref>). We conclude that in most cases, RhlR needs to bind at least one of C<sub>4</sub>HSL or PqsE for maximal activation of gene targets. We speculated that there is an inverse relationship between dependence on C<sub>4</sub>HSL and dependence on PqsE, as appears to be the case for sites associated with <italic toggle="yes">rhlA</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">lasB</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">hcnA</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">lecB</italic> (Figs <xref rid="pgen.1010900.g005" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="pgen.1010900.g006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). However, this is not generally the case, with an R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.08 when comparing RhlR binding dependence on C<sub>4</sub>HSL to RhlR binding dependence on PqsE (<xref rid="pgen.1010900.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>). Moreover, C<sub>4</sub>HSL is required for binding at some sites more than others but is essential for maximal expression everywhere, suggesting that C<sub>4</sub>HSL binding to RhlR imparts substantial conformational changes in RhlR without necessarily impacting the ability of RhlR to bind DNA. These findings indicate that RhlR can be stable without a small molecule ligand in <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aeruginosa</italic>, which is not the case in <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>.<italic toggle="yes">coli</italic> overexpression systems [<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. The prevailing dogma was that this class of LuxR-type receptors folded around their native ligand during complex assembly. However, previous Western blot analyses on RhlR in a &#x00394;<italic toggle="yes">rhlI</italic> strain revealed that RhlR remained in the soluble fraction and was not targeted for degradation; it was unclear if the protein was functional [<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Our results point to a scenario where RhlR is stable without C<sub>4</sub>HSL because of the presence of PqsE. PqsE is required for RhlR binding to some sites more than others, but the ability of RhlR to activate transcription is only weakly affected by loss of <italic toggle="yes">pqsE</italic> at sites that lose a significant amount of RhlR binding when <italic toggle="yes">pqsE</italic> is absent. We speculate that C<sub>4</sub>HSL:RhlR bound to PqsE, while having a higher affinity for promoter DNA than C<sub>4</sub>HSL:RhlR alone, is an overall weaker activator of transcription.</p><fig position="float" id="pgen.1010900.g007"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1010900.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>PqsE and C<sub>4</sub>HSL binding dependencies for RhlR occur on a spectrum.</title><p>Correlation of relative RhlR binding dependencies on both C<sub>4</sub>HSL and PqsE.

Initially, we hypothesized that PqsE could drive RhlR to promoters with a more degenerate binding motif, or promoters without a detectable binding motif. While that appears to be the case with <italic toggle="yes">hcnA</italic>, it is not true for <italic toggle="yes">lecB</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1010900.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We were unable to infer a PqsE-dependent motif because so few binding sites are strongly associated with PqsE for binding. Future experiments involving chimeric binding sites may reveal the molecular basis for PqsE promoter dependency. Additionally, regions surrounding the RhlR-dependent motif could have an effect on binding to the motif sequence in a PqsE-dependent or -independent manner. For example, integration host factor (IHF) in <italic toggle="yes">Vibrio harveyi</italic> regulates LuxR binding and transcription at the <italic toggle="yes">luxC</italic> promoter by binding to regions upstream of the <italic toggle="yes">lux</italic>-box binding motif, bending the DNA, and physically interacting with LuxR [<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Thus, additional regulatory sequences or regulatory elements could alter PqsE-dependency by specifically interacting with PqsE only when it is in complex with RhlR.</p><p>The activation of a transcription factor, in this case, RhlR, via an accessory protein, such as PqsE, is unique in QS. We speculate that the relative abundance of C<sub>4</sub>HSL and PqsE might differ according to different growth conditions, particularly with respect to cell density, and these relative differences affect the timing of RhlR-dependent gene expression. For example, conditions might exist where PqsE concentrations are low, which would result in a higher dependence on C<sub>4</sub>HSL binding and activation, leading to a subset of RhlR-dependent genes being expressed. Given that RhlR represses <italic toggle="yes">pqsE</italic> expression, we speculate that expression of the PqsE-dependent RhlR regulon decreases as C<sub>4</sub>HSL accumulates. Thus, there is likely a window at which the C<sub>4</sub>HSL and PqsE concentrations are &#x0201c;optimal&#x0201d;, where maximal gene expression of both regulons can occur. Further studies are needed to determine whether the timing of RhlR activation for different genes is impacted by the dependence on PqsE.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Materials &#x00026; methods</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>Specific growth conditions for the different strains of <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">aeruginosa</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">E</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">coli</italic> are described below for their corresponding experiments.

Similarly, the absolute difference in RNA levels for <italic toggle="yes">hcnA</italic> between &#x00394;<italic toggle="yes">pqsE</italic> and WT cells is 80% of the difference between &#x00394;<italic toggle="yes">rhlR</italic> and WT cells, despite the fold-change numbers being rather different. Plots of relative ChIP-enrichment and expression were generated using R. Genome browser images were generated using signal map. ChIP-seq data used in the genome browser were normalized to reads/100,000,000 reads. RNA seq data were normalized as part of Rockhopper alignment. To identify MvaT binding detected by RhlR-ChIP, the sequences of sites without a RhlR deletion-associated change in binding were entered into multiblast for PAO1. Previously detected MvaT binding sites in PAO1 were then compared to the artifactual sites [<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pgen.1010900.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The probability of a site being intergenic was calculated using a binomial test, predicting the likelihood of 32 sites being intergenic out of 40 total and testing with the proportion of the genome that is intergenic (non-coding bases/total bases).

</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#x000a0;The pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginsoa regulates hundreds of genes through its interconnected quorum sensing (QS) systems. Of particular importance is the LuxR-type quorum sensing receptor RhlR, which is involved in the regulation of several key virulence factors. To-date, a direct RhlR regulon has been elusive, with evidence for RhlR gene regulation limited to RNA-Seq studies and therefore to genes that are both directly and indirectly regulated by RhlR. Here, the authors use ChIP-Seq to determine regions of DNA directly bound by RhlR and to illuminate three distinct categories of RhlR-bound promoters: 1) those that require the cognate signal, C4-HSL, 2) those that require the protein PqsE, and 3) those that require both C4-HSL and PqsE for binding. The authors go on to correlate RhlR binding at these sites with gene expression in various genetic mutants. The authors should be commended on a well-written and rigorous study of the RhlR regulon and the influence of PqsE on RhlR activity. Notably, the authors perform their experiments in P. aeruginosa PA14 that is WT or has specific genes deleted. Given the known impact of receptor overexpression on both signal sensitivity and signal-independent gene activation, it is significant that the authors conducted their experiments in strains that preserve native regulation of RhlR expression. I have only minor comments on what is sure to be a broadly interesting and important contribution to the fields of cell-cell signaling and gene regulation.</p><p>1) In the abstract (lines 34-35) the authors state RhlR binds PqsE-dependent sites and &#x0201c;regulates transcription from [them] independent of the presence of autoinducer&#x0201d;. This is somewhat misrepresentative of the data presented. Even for genes where C4-HSL does not affect binding, the authors &#x0201c;still observed a substantial requirement for C4-HSL for regulation by RhlR (line 204) and &#x0201c;C4-HSL is required for RhlR to maximally activate transcription&#x0201d; from these genes (line 206). It would be accurate to state RhlR can activate transcription from the genes without C4-HSL, but C4-HSL still plays a role in their regulation.</p><p>2) In the abstract (line 36) the authors state the effect of C4-HSL on binding does not correlate with its role in regulating RhlR-dependent gene expression, but on line 200, the authors state C4-HSL-dependent changes in gene expression correlate positively with C4-HSL dependent changes in RhlR binding. These appear to be opposite conclusions. In figure 3C, the relationship between C4-dependent binding and gene expression seems flat or only weakly positive. The authors should provide a quantitative metric for the correlation (or lack thereof) along with its statistical significance.</p><p>3) Line 137 &#x02013; It would be of interest for the authors to briefly explain how the RhlR binding motif compares to lux-box sequences for other receptors.</p><p>4) Line 197 &#x02013; It would be clearer for the authors to state they compared expression of direct RhlR target genes +/- rhlI to identify C4-dependent changes.</p><p>5) Figure 4C &#x02013; It would be useful to provide a quantitative metric of correlation in PqsE dependence that could be compared to C4-dependencies shown in Fig 3C.</p><p>6) Line 271 &#x02013; The authors state the ChIP-Seq analysis of RhlR in a &#x02206;rhlI&#x02206;pqsE strain results in nearly same decrease in binding occupancy as &#x02206;rhlR and reference Fig 5B, which shows a comparison of &#x02206;rhlI&#x02206;pqsE and WT enrichment. It would be helpful to include a comparison of &#x02206;rhlI&#x02206;pqsE and &#x02206;rhlR to justify the claim that they have &#x0201c;nearly the same decrease in binding occupancy&#x0201d;. This could be a supplemental figure.</p><p>7) It would be helpful for the authors to include statistical analyses of key comparisons, particularly in Fig 5C where some differences in expression level seem minor or have large errors.</p><p>8) In figure 6, the authors use 1 uM C4-HSL to stimulate the activity of RhlR heterologously expressed in E. coli. Is this a sufficient concentration to stimulate maximal activity for each of the reporters? It seems unlikely as published EC50 values for RhlR expressed in E. coli range from 9 - 120 uM (PMID 30114353, 26460240, 30837333). The authors should justify their choice of 1 uM C4-HSL in this experiment and consider repeating the experiment with a higher concentration of C4-HSL.</p><p>Relatedly, is it possible &#x0201c;C4-independent&#x0201d; genes simply require a higher concentration of C4-HSL than provided, or produced in these experiments? This may be true in both the E. coli studies and in P. aeruginosa where C4 production in planktonic culture could be less than that in biofilms or in other environments. Perhaps PqsE stabilizes RhlR at low concentrations of C4-HSL but at higher concentrations, the impact of PqsE is lower or even negligible?</p><p>9) Line 518 &#x02013; What was the OD of the cultures when collected for qPCR? The authors state &#x0201c;until the optimal cell density was achieved&#x0201d; without giving a specific number.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;This study describes a comprehensive Chip-Seq analysis of the regulon of P. aeruginosa quorum sensing regulator RhlR. The study also looks at how the RhlR-binding protein PqsE influence RhlR promoter occupancy from in vivo CHIP-seq studies. The results map the set of gene promoters that RhlR occupies in the presence and absence of its ligand C4-HSL and a regulator protein PqsE.</p><p>Global studies of RhlR binding have not been previously carried out. Thus, the studies provide important new insight into RhlR and P. aeruginosa quorum sensing biology. The finding that RhlR promoter occupancy is altered by interacting with PqsE also represents a newly described mechanism of transcription regulation and is very interesting.</p><p>The paper is very clearly written and has a very appealing systems-level approach. However, there are some issues with clarity of writing and presentation that need to be addressed before the manuscript is ready for publication.</p><p>Major criticisms</p><p>1. The Chip-seq results using natively expressed RhlR show that PqsE alters the promoter occupancy of RhlR but a limitation of this approach is that there are a variety of mechanisms that could alter RhlR promoter occupancy. Care should be taken in drawing conclusions from these results, for example by replacing terms such as &#x0201c;PqsE alters RhlR promoter selection&#x0201d; with &#x0201c;PqsE alters promoter occupancy.&#x0201d;</p><p>2. There are some problems with the figures that need addressed. The figure headings are not informative and in some cases do not reflect what is seen as the main point of the figure. In some cases the figures are also difficult to interpret or lack critical information. See below for specific examples.</p><p>3. The discussion, particularly the first paragraph, needs revision. In particular, many of the statements are not clear and there are some issues with the conclusions being drawn &#x02013; see below for specific examples.</p><p>Specific criticisms</p><p>1. Fig. 2 needs clarification. First, the heading is not accurately describing the data. The data are more related to which genes from the Chip-seq study correlate with the RhlR-regulated genes from RNAseq. Also, it seems you used some sort of cutoff (log2 of 2?) to decide which genes were transcriptionally induced by RhlR and which weren&#x02019;t, where this cutoff is should be indicated on the graph or at least described in the legend.</p><p>2. Fig. 3C &#x02013; this figure is intuitively difficult to understand. Also, the text on lines 200-202 states that there is a positive correlation between C4-dependent changes in gene expression and RhlR binding, but this is not clear from the data, and there is no positive correlation line or statistics to support this statement. Also, based on the rest of description in the results, and looking at the data, it seems that the point is actually that RhlR does not necessarily need C4-HSL for binding but it does need it to activate. That&#x02019;s not really reflective of a positive correlation.</p><p>3. Fig. 4 &#x02013; no correlation line or statistics to support the conclusion that there is a correlation. In addition, the discussion of this data in lines 246-255 seems to be highlighting the variability (although the example on lines 245-247 was difficult to follow), and not the correlation.</p><p>4. Fig. 6A &#x02013; it would be helpful to see these data in their raw form (+ and &#x02013; C4-HSL, so that an evaluation of the relative levels of induction can be taken into consideration. In addition, statistical comparisons are needed to support the conclusions.</p><p>5. Fig. 6B &#x02013; because EMSA experiments cannot be conducted in +/- C4-HSL conditions due to technical limitations, it is unclear whether PqsE is altering the ability of RhlR to respond to C4 or simply increasing its promoter affinity. The data in Fig. 6A do seem to support the idea that it is the former and not the latter (although visualizing the data in its raw form would help with that interpretation). Also, in absence of promoter binding affinity calculations, it is difficult to determine if the promoter affinity is altered in the same way for each of the genes (in which case PqsE would be altering the promoter selectivity and not just affinity). Without the EMSA +/- C4 data and a rigorous study of promoter binding affinities with several different promoters, care should be taken in describing the interpretation of the Chip-Seq data (see major point #1 above and point #6 below).</p><p>6. Lines 154-155. The wording here suggests the RNAseq study used for this analysis was published previously, but upon closer examination of the methods it appears that those experiments were done for this study. This section needs to be rewritten to clarify that where the RNAseq results came from. Also, it appears that at least one other RNAseq study focused on PqsE is in the published literature (ref. 42). A comparison of the approach and differences in results of each study should be discussed either here or in the discussion.</p><p>7. Line 288 &#x02013; the heterologous E. coli reporter system is not equivalent to an in vitro system because it is not in vitro.</p><p>8. How were the DNA probes in the EMSA experiments detected? It appears they were detected by fluorescence. This needs to be clarified in the methods.</p><p>Relatively minor:</p><p>Line 191: it doesn&#x02019;t seem like there should be a dash between &#x0201c;C4-HSL&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;dependent&#x0201d;</p><p>The paragraph starting at line 222 is not clear. I think what it is trying to say is that several new genes have been identified that have robust effects of PqsE, but that is not clear.</p><p>Lines 258-260: please remind the reader where the data are to support this statement &#x02013; (&#x0201c;ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data showed that RhlR binding and RhlR-dependent transcription activation of rhlA and lasB are more dependent on C4HSL than PqsE, whereas the opposite is true for hcnA and lecB.&#x0201d;)</p><p>Specific examples of problems in the discussion that needs addressed (just from the first paragraph) are below -</p><p>- Line 306: &#x0201c;the direct RhlR regulon&#x0201d; is an unclear term</p><p>- Line 307: &#x0201c;RhlR-dependent changes in RNA levels&#x0201d; is also unclear - do you mean RhlR-dependent changes in gene transcription?</p><p>- Line 308: This sentence could be softened &#x02013; perhaps &#x0201c;provides insight into direct vs. indirect regulation&#x0201d;</p><p>- Line 310: This section is unclear. Having RhlR binding sites without evidence of regulation does not necessarily support condition-specific regulation. Perhaps what was meant was that some genes are RhlR regulated only under some conditions?</p><p>- Line 311-312: what is &#x0201c;direct RhlR target genes&#x0201d; &#x02013; is this meant to be &#x0201c;genes directly regulated by RhlR&#x0201d;?</p><p>- Line 314 &#x02013; it is not clear how the RNAseq study in ref. 42 is different or how the results compared with those in this study. Also, why do the prior RNAseq studies suggest that most of the regulon is indirectly controlled by RhlR? Don&#x02019;t your results also suggest this?</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#x000a0;The manuscript entitled &#x0201c;Promoter selectivity of the RhlR quorum-sensing transcription factor receptor in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is coordinated by distinct and overlapping dependencies on C4-homoserine lactone and PqsE&#x0201d; by Keegan and collaborators aims to enlighten the current comprehension of the quorum sensing (QS) network in the bacterium P. aeruginosa. The authors performed ChIP-Seq analyses of the transcriptional regulator RhlR to decipher the role of the cognate autoinducer C4-HSL and PqsE in DNA binding. The significance of this work lies in its ability to unravel the direct contributions of RhlR to the QS network, thereby advancing our understanding of this crucial communication system. Despite the intriguing nature of the provided data, the manuscript suffers from a lack of overall cohesion in its structural organization, hampering the potential of the findings.</p><p>Overall remarks:</p><p>The manuscript contains crucial data for individuals interested in studying gene regulation and quorum sensing of the opportunistic pathogen P. aeruginosa. However, to enhance its impact and clarity, some structural revisions are essential. It is imperative for the authors to establish a primary focus for the manuscript and then reorganize its content accordingly. The current arrangement lacks coherence, leading to confusion even among experts in the field.</p><p>Certain sections have been disproportionately emphasized, such as Figures 5 and 6, while novel findings (ChIP-Seq results in the double rhlI and pqsE mutant), have not received adequate attention. These imbalances should be rectified in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>The Abstract contains a couple of statements that are not in line with the data. By reading it, (1) it is suggested that the binding of PqsE with RhlR changes the affinity of the latter for its binding sites &#x02013; implying a distinct consensus region for the different forms of RhlR. (2) The transcription of these regions is not induced by the presence of C4-HSL. (3) C4-HSL is generally required for the RhlR DNA binding. None of those are supported by the data presented in the manuscript.</p><p>The manuscript is based on multiple analyses of ChIP-Seq. Those were designed to have the parallel analyses in the rhlR mutant as control. In accordance with the experimental design, the authors attribute 40 regions to be true RhlR-bound regions. As also mentioned by the authors, multiple genes coding known transcriptional regulators have associated RhlR binding sites (ln 166-167). Taking the experimental design into consideration, and considering the lack of specificity of the polyclonal antibody anti-RhlR, the authors should address the limitations.</p><p>Overall, there is a lot of confusion in how the manuscript is written and it should be reworked for clarity.</p><p>Ln 211-212: It is stated: &#x0201c;We speculated that PqsE can assist RhlR binding to some sites in the absence of C4HSL, which would explain the variable dependence of different RhlR binding sites for C4HSL.&#x0201d;</p><p>However, this paragraph does not adresse this as it focuses on data in the pqsE mutant in presence of C4HSL. They did perform analyses in the double pqsErhlI mutant but these data are not discussed here.</p><p>Ln 237: &#x0201c;Consistent with our prior study, binding of RhlR in cells expressing pqsE D73A was very similar to that in WT cells (Figure S2A), and binding of RhlR in cells expressing pqsE-NI was very similar to that of &#x00394;pqsE cells (Figure S2B), consistent with the overlapping expression profiles of both pqsE D73A with WT (Figure S2C) and pqsE-NI with &#x00394;pqsE (Figure S2D) [29,47].&#x0201d;</p><p>Very similar in what way? Avoid vague qualification of data. Is the difference significant or not ?</p><p>Ln 281: &#x0201c;To directly assess the role of each of the regulators in gene expression, we compared the effect of C4HSL and PqsE on RhlR-dependent transcription activation of rhlA, lasB, hcnA, and lecB using luciferase reporter fusions in Escherichia coli expressing either rhlR or rhlR and pqsE, +/- C4HSL (Figure 6A) [29,47,59]. &#x0201c;</p><p>The use of each of the regulators here is confusing&#x02026;the only regulator listed here is RhlR.</p><p>Related to Figure 5: Based on the data presented, the authors seem to suggest a complementary role of C4-HSL and PqsE to RhlR functioning. The latter seems to be required for the formation of a DNA binding complex (as PqsE does not greatly alter the transcriptional profile but is required for RhlR binding) whilst the former induces its transcriptional activity (C4-HSL induces the transcription of genes that do not require this AI for binding). Can that assumption be generalized for most of the RhlR binding sites examined in this manuscript? And if so, can the authors propose a model in which RhlR binds to and activates its target genes?</p><p>In line with that, have the authors observed the binding of RhlR to its regulated sites in the absence of both C4-HSL and PqsE? Knowing whether the inactivated RhlR can bind to DNA in the absence of PqsE would help us further understand the steps required for RhlR activation.</p><p>Also, the authors infer three distinct modes of activation by RhlR in the Abstract. One of them states that RhlR can be active when bound to PqsE only. However, although this complex can bind to DNA, the transcription of most targets seems to be C4-HSL-dependent. Considering this, is the complex RhlR:PqsE really active?</p><p>Ln 325-330. The logic used by the authors in this section confuses me. It is stated that C4-HSL is required for efficient transcription activation (thus, probably inducing a conformational change that stabilizes RhlR). However, the conclusion is that RhlR can be stable and functional without the presence of the ligand.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>Ln 85: Pseudomonas should be in italic</p><p>Ln 108: &#x0201c;For example, the rhamnolipid synthase, rhlA,&#x0201d; should be the gene coding for the rhamnolipid synthase or RhlA.</p><p>Ln 110: &#x0201c;Conversely, the hydrogen cyanide synthase, hcnA, Same comment: the synthase refers to the protein and should be written as HcnA.</p><p>Ln 161.

</p><p>Reviewer #1:&#x000a0;This manuscript presents a valuable dataset to the field of bacterial cell-cell signaling and the revisions have significantly improved the clarity of the authors&#x02019; analysis. The authors should consider the following minor revisions to further improve clarity in their discussion of the data.</p><p>1) Line 191 &#x02013; there appears to be a misplaced reference in the middle of the sentence ([59]).</p><p>2) Lines 297-298: The authors state for hcnA and lecB qPCR experiments, &#x0201c;maximal expression was dependent on the presence of PqsE as the &#x02206;rhlI strain had higher expression levels for both genes than the &#x02206;rhlI&#x02206;pqsE strain&#x0201d;. At 25 uM C4-HSL, the strains appear to have similar transcript levels, especially given the error bars. What is the difference in expression level and is it consequential?</p><p>3) Could the authors provide more guidance on interpretation of Table 1? Specifically what does &#x0201c;RhlR expression change, PqsE expression change, etc.&#x0201d; refer to? It would seem it is the RNASeq transcript level in WT compared to the deletion strain, but it is unclear how the numbers in the table translate to analysis in the text.</p><p>a. For example, on line 263, the authors state &#x0201c;the effect of deleting pqsE on the expression of hcnA was similar to the effect of deleting rhlR&#x0201d;. But in Table 1, the expression change for hcnA is 10.2 and 3.6 for RhlR and PqsE, respectively. As such, it appears the effect of deleting rhlR is much greater than the effect of deleting pqsE. This is consistent with the qPCR data in 5A where &#x02206;pqsE has a much higher transcript level than &#x02206;rhlR.</p><p>b. Similarly, on line 270, the authors state &#x0201c;the effect of deleting pqsE on expression of PA14_01490 was only 30% the effect of deleting rhlR&#x0201d;. The values for RhlR expression change and PqsE expression change are 18.4 and 1.4, respectively. How does that translate to the effect of pqsE being 30% that of rhlR?</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;attachment</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#x000a0;The revised manuscript titled "Promoter Selectivity of the RhlR Quorum-Sensing Transcription Factor Receptor in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Is Coordinated by Distinct and Overlapping Dependencies on C4-Homoserine Lactone and PqsE," authored by Keegan and colleagues, represents a significant improvement over the original version.</p><p>The authors have addressed the specific comments raised by the reviewers, including my own, resulting in a notably clearer manuscript that enhances the reader's understanding of the results.</p><p>However, the authors have chosen to retain the original structure of the manuscript. Consequently, despite the improvements, the revised version still exhibits some structural imbalances, as previously noted.</p><p>I still have some minor comments.</p><p>They should address the title to incorporate the term "promoter occupancy," which the authors have adopted. As the core of the manuscript relies on ChIP-Seq analysis, it is also advisable for the authors to address the limitations they themselves have acknowledged regarding the constraints of the technique.</p><p>In the revised version, C4-HSL concentration for figure 6 was changed from 1 &#x000b5;M to 4 (it was also changed in the method section). The authors justified to reviewer 1 that they based their use of 1 &#x000b5;M to what they found in the literature. There is no explanation as why the concentration was changed, and the figures are the same. Which concentration is the right one?</p><p>Figure 5 (A and C) should still show signs of statistical analyses as was requested by reviewers.</p><p>This is only minor but:</p><p>Table S3: even if the WT strain is listed as being PA14 in the table, it should be mentioned for each mutant that PA14 is the background. Also the numbers from the first column don&#x02019;t line up start from 2 ?</p><p>Strain 21 does not have a strain number ?</p><p>**********</p><p>

</p><p>Dear Dr Paczkowski,</p><p>We are pleased to inform you that your manuscript entitled "Promoter selectivity of the RhlR quorum-sensing transcription factor receptor in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is coordinated by distinct and overlapping dependencies on C4-homoserine lactone and&#x000a0;PqsE" has been editorially accepted for publication in PLOS Genetics. Congratulations!</p><p>Before your submission can be formally accepted and sent to production you will need to complete our formatting changes, which you will receive in a follow up email. Please be aware that it may take several days for you to receive this email; during this time no action is required by you. Please note: the accept date on your published article will reflect the date of this provisional acceptance, but your manuscript will not be scheduled for publication until the required changes have been made.</p><p>Once your paper is formally accepted, an uncorrected proof of your manuscript will be published online ahead of the final version, unless you&#x02019;ve already opted out via the online submission form. If, for any reason, you do not want an earlier version of your manuscript published online or are unsure if you have already indicated as such, please let the journal staff know immediately at <email>plosgenetics@plos.org</email>.</p><p>In the meantime, please log into Editorial Manager at <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/pgenetics/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.editorialmanager.com/pgenetics/</ext-link>, click the "Update My Information" link at the top of the page, and update your user information to ensure an efficient production and billing process.&#x000a0;Note that&#x000a0;PLOS requires an ORCID iD for all corresponding authors. Therefore, please ensure that you have an ORCID iD and that it is validated in Editorial Manager. To do this, go to &#x02018;Update my Information&#x02019; (in the upper left-hand corner of the main menu), and click on the Fetch/Validate link next to the ORCID field.&#x000a0; This will take you to the ORCID site and allow you to create a new iD or authenticate a pre-existing iD in Editorial Manager.</p><p>If you have a press-related query, or would like to know about making your underlying data available (as you will be aware, this is required for publication), please see the end of this email. If your institution or institutions have a press office, please notify them about your upcoming article at this point, to enable them to help maximise its impact. Inform journal staff as soon as possible if you are preparing a press release for your article and need a publication date.</p><p>Thank you again for supporting open-access publishing; we are looking forward to publishing your work in PLOS Genetics!</p><p>Yours sincerely,</p><p>Ajai A Dandekar, MD, PhD</p><p>Guest Editor</p><p>PLOS Genetics</p><p>Lotte S&#x000f8;gaard-Andersen</p><p>Section Editor</p><p>PLOS Genetics</p><p>
