Viral evasion is a passive mechanism by which viruses overwhelm host defenses, or invade organs or cells where the host defenses cannot reach them. The ability of a virus to counter host defenses requires an active mechanism to either bypass or disarm the host machinery. Viruses invading vertebrate hosts produce virokines and viroceptors which interact with immune response molecules to inhibit or modulate their anti-viral activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Recent studies have shown many viruses infecting a wide range of eukaryotic hosts encode proteins that suppress the RNA silencing, anti-viral defense response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Silencing suppressors encoded by viruses limit degradation of viral RNAs by the RNA silencing machinery. Among plant viruses, some silencing suppressor proteins also affect symptom development and increase virus titer. The <italic>Cucumber mosaic virus </italic>(CMV) 2b, the <italic>Tobacco etch virus </italic>(TEV) HC-Pro, and the <italic>Tomato bushy stunt virus </italic>(TBSV) P19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] proteins are among the best studied silencing suppressors that are also pathogenicity determinants. The TBSV P19 protein was unique because it affects disease severity in a host specific manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Little is known about the evolution and phylogenetic relationships of silencing suppressor proteins. In particular, viruses belonging to the genera <italic>Furo-, Hordei-, Tobra-, Peclu-, Beny-, Carla</italic>-, and <italic>Pomovirus </italic>encode small cysteine-rich proteins (CRPs) near the 3' ends of their genomes, and some have been identified as both silencing suppressor proteins and pathogenicity factors. For example, the <italic>Barley stripe mosaic virus </italic>(BSMV; a hordeivirus) gamma b protein and the <italic>Peanut clump virus </italic>(PCV; a pecluvirus) 15K protein suppress RNA silencing, modulate symptom severity, and systemic virus accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The <italic>Tobacco rattle virus </italic>(TRV; a tobravirus) 16K CRP has been described as a pathogenicity factor and suppresses RNA silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In complementation studies, the <italic>Soilborne wheat mosaic virus </italic>(SBWMV; a furovirus) 19K CRP, the BSMV gamma b protein, and the CMV 2b (which is not a CRP) protein functionally replaced the 16K CRP of TRV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Since deletion of the TRV 16K CRP ORF reduced virus accumulation in plants, functional replacement by these heterologous viral ORFs indicates that these CRPs share some common function. Characterizing the functional similarities among these CRPs is crucial to understanding their evolutionary relationship. Until now the phylogenetic relationships among these CRPs are unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>This study was undertaken to characterize the SBWMV 19K CRP. SBWMV is a bipartite RNA virus and is the type member for the genus <italic>Furovirus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. RNA1 encodes the viral replicase and putative viral movement protein (MP). The viral replicase is encoded by a single large open reading frame (ORF) and is phylogenetically related to the <italic>Tobacco mosaic virus </italic>(TMV) replicase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The 3' proximal ORF of RNA1 encodes a 37K MP that shares sequence similarity with the dianthovirus MP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. SBWMV RNA2 encodes four proteins. The 5' proximal ORF of RNA2 encodes a 25K protein from a nonAUG start codon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and its role in virus infection is unknown. The coat protein (CP) ORF has an opal translational termination codon and readthrough of this codon produces a large 84K protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The CP readthrough domain (RT) is required for plasmodiophorid transmission of the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The 3' proximal ORF of RNA2 encodes a 19K CRP.</p><p>To gain insight into the role of the SBWMV 19K CRP in virus infection, amino acid sequence comparisons were conducted to determine the relatedness of the SBWMV 19K CRP to other viral CRPs. The <italic>Potato virus X </italic>(PVX) infectious clone was used to express the SBWMV CRP and to study its role in virus pathogenicity and suppressing RNA silencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>SBWMV 19K protein is a conserved CRP</title><p>The Pfam Protein Families Database reports a family of CRPs with similar sequences which includes proteins from BSMV, PSLV, PCV and SBWMV (Pfam 04521.5). Since there are viruses not included in the Pfam report that encode CRPs, this study was undertaken to determine if there is a larger CRP family containing related viral proteins. Further examination in this study reveals that the CRPs encoded by all known hordei-, peclu- and furoviruses share significant sequence similarity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Efforts to find similarity between these proteins and CRPs encoded by pomo-, beny- and potyviruses were not successful. Whether these other plant viral CRPs are also suppressors of silencing can not be concluded at this point for two reasons: insufficient study and only weak sequence similarity relationships. Sequences of CRPs that affect virus replication and are encoded by members of other virus genera were also determined to be unrelated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Amino acid sequence alignment of the CRPs encoded by furo-, peclu-, tobra- and hordeiviruses.

Seven of these Cys residues are conserved in all furovirus proteins and are located in the N-terminal half of the protein. Five of these residues are within the block of sequences designated as protein family Pfam04521.5 and three of the conserved Cys residues are also conserved in the hordeiviral and pecluviral proteins. A selection from this alignment was corrected for several misplacements of short peptide sequences and is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. The alignment represents the entire length of these proteins, although the termini are aligned with less confidence than the core. Examination of the tobraviral CRP sequences revealed sufficient similarity to justify their alignment with the Pfam04521.5 sequences. The alignment resulted in a significance score between 6 and 7, suggesting that the tobraviral proteins belong to this family.</p><p>The multiple sequence alignment of 33 CRPs from furo-, tobra-, peclu-, and hordeiviruses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) revealed three absolutely conserved residues: Cys70, Cys112, and His116 (numbering based on the aligned sequences). Gly113 was conserved in all viruses (except TRV-CAN) and is contained within a Cys-Gly-Xaa-Xaa-His motif in which one of the two Xaa residues is Lys or Arg. There is a Cys residue at position 7, 8 or 9 which is conserved in all except PCV and IPCV (pecluvirus) amino acid sequences. Alignment of the N-terminus is not exact since the PCV and IPCV proteins are N-terminally truncated. Within the N-terminal half, there are additional positions containing Cys residues that are conserved for some but not all viruses. For example, Cys9 is conserved among hordei-, tobra-, and some furoviruses; Cys at position 32 and 33 is conserved among all but pecluviruses; Cys36 is conserved among hordei- and furoviruses; Cys45 is conserved among furo and tobraviruses; Cys76 is conserved among furo and tobraviruses (except for SCSV; the pecluvirus PCV, but not IPCV, also has Cys76); Cys80 is conserved among all viruses except PeRSV and PEBV. Lys at position 52 and Arg at position 54 or 55 (Lys-Xaa-Arg or Lys-Xaa-Xaa-Arg) are conserved among all except PSLV. Gly at position 77 is conserved among all except tobraviruses.</p><p>The secondary structure prediction derived from the multiple sequence alignment is a long helical region extending from or slightly beyond the Cys-Gly-Xaa-Xaa-His motif to within 20 residues of the C-terminus. The furoviral proteins have spacings of conserved Leu residues from positions 89 to 106 consistent with a leucine zipper structure (which was not apparent in the original Pfam 04521.5). The N-terminal halves of the aligned amino acid sequences, containing most of the Cys residues, have a mixture of extended, helical and loop predicted structures.</p><p>The pecluviruses PCV and IPCV, and the hordeiviruses BSMV, LyRSV, and PSLV proteins contain a Ser-Lys-Leu sequence at the C-terminus. This tripeptide was shown for PCV to be a peroxisomal targeting signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This signal is not present in CRPs of furo- or tobraviruses.</p></sec><sec><title>SBWMV 19K CRP aggravates PVX-induced symptoms</title><p>The tobravirus and hordeivirus CRPs have been described as pathogenicity determinants that regulate symptom severity in infected plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].

In this assay, GFP-expression in the 16C transgenic <italic>N. benthamiana </italic>plants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) was silenced by infiltrating young leaves with a suspension of <italic>Agrobacterium </italic>expressing GFP.

Within two weeks, the spread of GFP silencing was viewed systemically (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>) and by three weeks, the only visible fluorescence is red fluorescence due to chlorophyll (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). At this time, the silenced plants were inoculated with PVX.19K. As PVX.19K viruses spread locally and then systemically, there was no change in GFP expression in the inoculated leaves or in the upper leaves (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). However, GFP expression was observed in the emerging leaves (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F &#x02013; H</xref>).

RNA samples collected from non silenced and silenced plants were also tested by Northern analysis to confirm the systemic accumulation of PVX.GUS or PVX.19K (data not shown). Since, GFP expression was restored in plants systemically infected with PVX.19K but remained silenced in plants inoculated with PVX.GUS, it is likely that the SBWMV 19K ORF is a suppressor of RNA silencing.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Many viruses encode proteins that suppress RNA silencing but the phylogenetic relatedness of these proteins is poorly understood. In this study, one class of viral CRPs, which were described as suppressors of RNA silencing and/or viral pathogenicity determinants, were shown to be phylogenetically related. These CRPs have a conserved Cys-Gly-Xaa-Xaa-His motif in which one of the two Xaa residues is Lys or Arg. The N-terminus has several conserved Cys residues that likely comprise a zinc finger motif. In fact, the ability of the gamma b protein of BSMV to bind Zn(II) was recently demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Prior to 1999, SBWMV, BNYVV, PCV, and PMTV belonged to the genus <italic>Furovirus</italic>. As sequence data from different furoviruses have become available, it became clear that there are significant differences in the genome organization of these viruses, and therefore furovirus classification was revised in 1999 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The genus <italic>Furovirus </italic>now consists of viruses similar in genome organization to SBWMV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. These viruses are bipartite and have a single MP that is phylogenetically related to the tobamovirus and dianthovirus MPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. BNYVV, PCV, and PMTV were reclassified into the genera <italic>Benyvirus, Pecluvirus</italic>, and <italic>Pomovirus</italic>, respectively, for two reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. First, the MPs of these viruses are phylogenetically distinct from SBWMV. BNYVV, PCV, and PMTV each possess a cluster of three slightly overlapping ORFs known as the "triple gene block", which has been shown for BNYVV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] to mediate viral cell-to-cell movement. Second, benyviruses and pomoviruses differ from furoviruses in the number of genome segments. BNYVV has four or five genome segments while PMTV has three genome segments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Pecluviruses like furoviruses have two genome segments, thus the primary difference between these virus genera is the MP ORFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. This is significant because the initial amino acid sequence comparisons of CRPs from furo-, hordei-, tobra-, and carlaviruses included BNYVV as the type-member of the genus <italic>Furovirus </italic>and concluded that these small CRPs were unrelated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Reclassification of the BNYVV as a member of the genus <italic>Benyvirus </italic>and inclusion of new members into the genus <italic>Furovirus </italic>led us to reexamine the relatedness of the viral CRPs. Based on the most recently defined taxonomic structure, the current amino acid sequence comparison presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> indicates that the CRPs derived from viruses of the genera <italic>Furo-, Hordei-, Peclu</italic>-, and <italic>Tobravirus </italic>are phylogenetically related. On the other hand, these proteins are so different from CRPs encoded by <italic>Pomo</italic>-, <italic>Beny- </italic>and <italic>Carlaviruses </italic>that the latter ones could not be included in the alignment (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>The present study shows that the SBWMV 19K CRP, when expressed from the PVX genome, functions as a pathogenesis factor and a suppressor of RNA silencing. The SBWMV 19K CRP, when it was expressed from the PVX genome, induced systemic necrosis on <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana, N. clevelandii, C. quinoa</italic>, and <italic>C. amaranticolor</italic>. These symptoms are distinct from the symptoms associated with PVX infection in these hosts, and from symptoms induced by SBWMV in its natural hosts. In systemic hosts, both PVX and SBWMV typically cause mosaic symptoms that range from mild to severe. In <italic>C. quinoa </italic>and <italic>C. amaranticolor </italic>both PVX and SBWMV cause mild chlorosis. Severe necrosis and ultimate collapse of the tissue has been reported for other unrelated viral proteins that are pathogenicity factors and suppressors of RNA silencing. This include the <italic>Poa semilatent virus </italic>(PSLV) gamma b, TBSV P19, <italic>Tobacco etch virus </italic>HC-Pro, and the <italic>Rice yellow mottle virus </italic>P1 proteins[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>When we introduced the SBWMV 19K ORF into the TBSV vector and inoculated it to <italic>N. benthamiama, N. tabacum, C. quinoa</italic>, and <italic>C. amaranticolor </italic>(data not shown) plants, the SBWMV 19K CRP did not have any effect on symptomology (data not shown). However, it was reported previously that protein expression levels from the TBSV vector might be too low to test the effects of heterologous proteins on symptom severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Since an antibody to the SBWMV 19K CRP is unavailable, the levels of protein expression from PVX or TBSV vectors could not be analyzed to determine if gene dosage or protein expression levels contribute to symptom severity.</p><p>In a related study, the SBWMV 19K and the BSMV gamma b CRPs could substitute for the TRV 16K CRP within the TRV genome, promoting virus replication and systemic accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The ability of the SBWMV 19K and the BSMV gamma b CRPs to induce severe symptoms when expressed from the PVX genome is reminiscent of phenomena described in relation to viral synergisms. The best studied viral synergism is between <italic>Tobacco etch virus </italic>(TEV) and PVX in which the TEV HC-Pro protein enhances accumulation and disease severity of PVX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. HC-Pro promotes infection of PVX by suppressing the anti-viral RNA silencing defense mechanism that would normally act on PVX to reduce virus infection. HC-Pro has the ability to increase PVX accumulation in the same way the SBWMV 19K CRP and the BSMV gamma b proteins were shown previously to enhance accumulation of TRV in infected plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The phylogenetic relatedness of the hordei-, peclu-, and furovirus CRPs is further substantiated by evidence that these proteins are all capable of suppressing RNA silencing in emerging leaves. This was demonstrated in the present and related studies using the same reversal of silencing assay used in this study. The SBWMV 19K CRP, the BSMV and PSLV gamma b CRPs, and the PCV 15K CRPs were each unable to change GFP expression in leaves where GFP was silenced prior to virus infection. However in each case, GFP expression occurred in newly emerging leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Thus, members of this family of CRPs similarly act on the RNA silencing machinery to block spread of the silencing signal into newly emerging leaves. In each case, the silencing suppressor activities of these CRPs have been compared to CMV and potyviruses in preventing onset of RNA silencing in new growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. While there is no evidence that the hordei-, peclu- and furovirus CRPs are related to the CMV or potyvirus silencing suppressors, it seems that the mode of action might be conserved among diverse viruses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Amino acid sequence comparisons</title><p>Related protein sequences were identified and retrieved from the NCBI data bank using PSI-BLAST. A PSI-BLAST search was launched with the amino acid sequence of the 19K CRP of <italic>Chinese wheat mosaic virus </italic>(CWMV, a furovirus). A similar search began with the amino acid sequence of BSMV gamma b, a sequence recovered in the CWMV search. Both searches converged at the second iteration and retrieved the same set of 22 sequences. This set contained CRPs derived from furo-, peclu- and hordeiviruses and contained the conserved P18 PFAM domain ("protein family"URL reference <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pfam.wustl.edu/"/>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>A preliminary alignment of the retrieved proteins sequences was performed using the multiple sequence alignment mode of ClustalX. These twenty two furovirus and hordeivirus sequences were aligned using ClustalX alignments suggested in the BLAST outputs and PFAM. The tobraviral CRPs were not recovered by the above procedure, but upon manual inspection, appeared to have Cys residues in a linear arrangement that was similar to the set of 22 proteins. Eleven tobraviral protein sequences, exclusive members of a conserved domain in the Conserved Domain database <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml"/> were aligned using ClustalX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. This tobraviral amino acid sequence alignment and the alignment of the 22 amino acid sequences sequences were assembled by ClustalX in profile mode, followed by manual adjustment. Amino acid sequences of aligned furo- and hordeiviral proteins were aligned with tobraviral amino acid sequences in profile mode of ClustalX (a total of thirty three sequences were aligned). A total of 33 amino acid sequences were aligned. In all cases, adjustments to the alignments were made using Se-Al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].
