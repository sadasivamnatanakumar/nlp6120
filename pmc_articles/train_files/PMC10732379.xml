This study investigated the potential of sewage-derived biofertilizers on the growth and physiology of <italic toggle="yes">Amaranthus cruentus</italic> plants. Various treatments were compared, including control treatments with inorganic fertilizer and treatments with biofertilizers composed of microalgae, biosolids and reclaimed water. The following traits were investigated: photosynthetic pigments, gas exchange, growth, and leaf nutrient concentrations. The results showed that the concentrations of N, P, Cu, Fe Zn and Na nutrients, in the dry microalgae and biosolids, were quite high for the needs of the plants. The wet microalgae presented high concentration of Cu, Fe and Zn nutrients while reclaimed water contained high concentration of N, K, Ca and S. Na and Zn nutrients increased in the leaf of plants treated with dry microalgae and biosolid, respectively. At the beginning of the flowering phase, total chlorophyll and carotenoids contents were lower for plants grown with wet microalgae while for plants grown with higher doses of biosolid or reclaimed water total chlorophyll was increased, and carotenoids were not affected. Lower photosynthetic pigments under wet microalgae resulted in lower photosynthetic rates. On the other hand, amendments with dry microalgae and biosolid increased photosynthetic rates with the biosolid being the most effective. Higher applications of biosolid, wet and dry microalgae produced a considerable increase in shoot biomass of amaranth, with the dry microalgae being the most effective. Additionally, reclaimed water obtained after tertiary treatment of sewage with microalgae and biosolids applied alone showed promising effects on plant growth. Overall, these findings suggest that organic fertilizers derived from sewage treatment have the potential to enhance plant growth and contribute to sustainable agricultural practices.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

Unfortunately, the linear production model in which we are immersed often leads to inefficient use of resources and the generation of waste [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The circular economy proposes a shift in production chains towards closed-loop processes to improve resource efficiency and reduce waste [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295624.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In this context, sewage is no longer considered as a waste, but as a valuable source for nutrient recovery [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295624.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which can be used to restore soil fertility and organic matter. Soil fertilization and the replacement of organic matter is essential due to the depletion of nutrients from the soil over the consecutive seasons, without which it is impossible to meet the food demand for a growing population [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. As a result, exploring alternative sources of fertilizers is of great importance in agriculture due to the high cost and negative environmental impact of inorganic fertilizers. According to the literature, the resources recovered from the treatment of sanitary sewage could potentially meet up to 30% of the agricultural demand for nitrogen (N) [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and 22% of the demand for phosphorus (P) [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295624.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], thereby reducing the need for chemical fertilizers.</p><p>Sewage sludge is a residue rich in organic matter generated during the treatment of sewage in sewage treatment plants (STP). The characteristic of biological sewage sludge depends on the source of sewage which may contain heavy metals in addition to mineral nutrients and organic matter [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, when subjected to additional treatments in order to reduce the water content and/or to stabilize the organic matter and remove pathogens [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, and references therein], it results in a biosolid that is easy to handle for disposal or use as a biofertilizer in agriculture because it has a large amount of nutrients and organic matter [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and additionally, these drying and disinfection processes guarantee the suitability of the biosolids to safety regulations [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Several studies have been conducted in order to verify the benefits of biosolid application on several crops&#x02019; growth and biochemical parameters [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In addition, the application of biosolid in areas undergoing reclamation can effectively improve the performance of introduced vegetation and the tolerance to potentially toxic elements [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] thus serving as a key tool for farm utilization [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The conventional sewage treatment processes have proven effective in managing sewage sludge but often present issues such as high energy consumption and the generation of residual sludge with environmental concerns. There is a growing interest in exploring alternative, sustainable sewage treatment options. The algal-based sewage treatment methods aims not only efficiently treat sewage but also harness the benefits thus contributing to the development of more sustainable and ecologically friendly solutions for sewage management.</p><p>Microalgae-based treatment of sewage is a promising method for nutrient recovery and wastewater treatment. After anaerobic treatment, the remaining effluent is favorable for the cultivation of microalgae as it retains most of the nutrients [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The ability of microalgae to use inorganic compounds such as N and P for their growth makes them efficient at removing nutrients from wastewater, which can reach up to 90% [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295624.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Additionally, microalgae can help in disinfection by varying the pH and improving the quality of the final effluent [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295624.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295624.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The recovery of chemical energy and nutrients from microalgae biomass is also possible. According to [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], 68% of the chemical energy of microalgal biomass can be recovered, in the form of bio-oil (44%) and biogas (23%), in addition to the recovery of 44% of the N content and 91% of the P content of biomass in the form of fertilizer products. The organic matter of microalgae can also be used as a nutritive material with advantageous characteristics for crops and soil. From the organic matter of these microalgae, nutritive material can be obtained with advantageous characteristics for the crops and the soil, depending on the microalgae&#x02019;s ability to improve soil quality, its microflora and increase productivity [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295624.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Studies have shown that organic microalgae fertilizer grown in wastewater can improve soil quality and increase crop productivity [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295624.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295624.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>The reuse of treated domestic sewage in agriculture can provide multiple benefits. Reclaimed water is a valuable alternative to traditional irrigation water sources and can contribute to reducing the pressure on freshwater resources [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The tertiary treatment of sewage with microalgae does not remove 100% of nutrients of the reclaimed water. Therefore, this treated sewage constitutes another by-product that can be destined for agriculture. Fertigation of plants with reclaimed water has proved to be very advantageous in regions where water availability is low [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295624.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition to its value as a source of water, reclaimed water has also been shown to be efficient in increasing the productivity of several crops of economic interest due to the presence of essential nutrients necessary for plant growth despite the presence of some metals [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

The most common studied plants were cereals such as wheat and rice that are C<sub>3</sub> plants, therefore there is a great need to investigate other crops such as C<sub>4</sub> plants which have different nutritional requirements. Amaranth is a C<sub>4</sub> plant of great agronomic importance because of its high nutritional and nutraceutical values which provide health benefits. Manyelo <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] reported higher calcium (Ca), P, magnesium (Mg) and potassium (K) contents (2771.07, 5024.56, 3501.36 and 5101.99 mg/kg, respectively) in the grain and significantly higher trace mineral content for Copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) (5.95, 23.71, 49.97 and 147.01 mg/kg, respectively). In addition, secondary metabolites, specifically anthocyanins, were shown to be abundant in grains (35.92 mg/kg), which reinforces its potential in increasing the immunity. Amaranth grains also have high content of starch (65&#x02013;75%), proteins (15.4&#x02013;16%), lipids (6.98&#x02013;7.22%) and several vitamins [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], besides being gluten free, making it important for celiac patients [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Bearing in mind the importance of recycling the nutrients contained in the sewage, the present study examined the effectiveness of sewage treatment by-products as organic fertilizer in the culture of <italic toggle="yes">Amaranthus cruentus</italic> L. Specifically, the study analyzed the responses of plants to sanitary sewage treatment by-products in terms of growth, shoot biomass production, photosynthetic pigments, leaf gas exchange and leaf nutrients.

above the suitable level, respectively (<xref rid="pone.0295624.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The content of micronutrients Cu, Fe, Zn and Na are above the level found in the plants grown under suitable nutrient supply (70% LA). On the contrary, the content of Mn was lower. In the <xref rid="pone.0295624.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> the chemical analysis of reclaimed water shows that it contains significant amounts of N, K, Ca and S after the wastewater treatment with microalgae but lower amounts of P and Mg. In relation to micronutrients, these are found in significantly lower concentrations.</p><p>As control treatments, we used plants grown under supply of 70% or 20% full strength LA nutrient solution in the absence of microalgae (70% LA and 20% LA). In previous experiments it was observed that desirable plant growth was achieved with the application of the 70% nutrient solution [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Leaves are plant organs that best reflect the nutritional status of the plant. Therefore, they indicate changes in the availability of nutrients in the soil. The chemical analyses of nutrients in the leaves were done 56 days after sowing. Plants grown under 20% LA showed lower levels of almost all nutrients analysed compare to 70% LA (<xref rid="pone.0295624.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The leaf chemical analysis show that of all the doses of dry microalgae used, the best results were found in the dose of 8 g, which showed superior results than the 20% LA for most macronutrients, except for S. The contents of micronutrients boron (B), Cu, Zn and Na were increased under the application of 8 g of dry microalgae compared to 20% LA. It is interesting to note that even the content of Cu, Fe, Zn and Na were higher in the dry microalgae, no excess of this nutrients were found in the leaves of amaranth. There was no clear correlation between the dose of wet microalgae applied and the concentration of nutrients observed in the leaves. Application of 9 g of wet microalgae resulted in higher levels of Ca, Mg, B, Cu, Zn and Na in the leaves of amaranth when compared to 20% LA (<xref rid="pone.0295624.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). When compared to the 70% control, the values for Ca, Mg, B and Zn were higher in plants with 9 g of wet microalgae. On the other hand, the content of K, Fe and Mn were lower than the two controls.</p><p>The content of N, K, B, Cu and Zn in the leaves of amaranth under the addition of 6 and 10 g of biosolid plus 20% LA were increase compare to 20% LA while P and Ca did not change significantly (<xref rid="pone.0295624.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The content of Mg and S were decreased with the increase in the doses of biosolid compared with 20% LA. Although the content of Na was high in the sludge its content was reduced to below the content of 20% LA. The Mn content under 10 g of biosolid with or without LA were reduced. When 10 g of biosolid were applied with tap water, the content o P, K, Mg, B and Mn were decreased while the content of S was increased. The high content of Cu, Fe and Zn in the biosolid resulted in more concentration in the leaves compared with the control 20% LA. Although the supply of Na in the biosolid was high, this did not result in a further increase in the concentration in the amaranth leaves. The leaves under reclaimed water presented contents of N, P, K, Ca and Mg that were higher than in the 20% LA (<xref rid="pone.0295624.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). However, the levels of micronutrients were much lower. Comparing reuse water with 70% LA, the leaves from plants grown under reclaimed water had lower concentrations of N and K but higher concentrations of Ca and Mg.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec021"><title>Discussion</title><p>Various methods to replace chemical fertilization have been explored, including the use of secondary products from different stages of sanitary sewage treatment that provide a rich source of nutrients. This study focuses on the use of sludge generated from anaerobic treatment of sanitary sewage, microalgae biomass as post-treatment of sanitary sewage, and reclaimed water obtained after separating microalgae as alternatives for recovering and using nutrients as fertilizers in amaranth cultivation.</p><p>The generation and appropriate disposal of sludge produced during the treatment of sanitary sewage has been a topic of concern, with efforts to reduce its production [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and to find sustainable reuse options. In Brazil, for instance, the annual production of dry matter from sludge exceeds 150,000 tons [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Fertilization has been identified as a promising destinations found for the sludge, with laws and regulations in place to ensure safety parameters for its application as biosolids [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295624.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The sludge and microalgae are rich sources of nutrients, particularly nitrogen, phosphorus, and micronutrients [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295624.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295624.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Moreover, the application of microalgae in soil can improve soil organic matter, which can enhance plant productivity [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295624.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295624.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Combining microalgae cultivation with sanitary sewage treatment can improve the cost-benefit of both processes [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The treated effluent obtained after the cultivation of microalgae is a crucial aspect of sanitary sewage treatment, and its use in agricultural practices can reduce the use of potable water for irrigation and help to recycle remaining nutrients that would otherwise be released into water bodies.</p><p>The nutrient composition of the organic fertilizers used in this study revealed that they all contained nutrients essential for plant development, albeit at different concentrations depending on the stage of treatment. The anaerobic sludge has lower levels of macronutrients such as N and K, compared to the dry microalgae biomass. However, the N and Ca content of the biosolid were suitable for the requirements of amaranth. The metal analysis showed that due to its high Zn concentration, the biosolid used was classified as class 2 by CONAMA resolution N&#x000ba; 498/2020, which restricts the maximum annual application rate based on the soil&#x02019;s characteristics [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Similar to studies by [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295624.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], the accumulation of Zn in the leaves of plants that received biosolids occurred together with copper accumulation. Zinc toxicity can reduce the leaf nutrient content, particularly for K, Fe and Mg, by inhibiting assimilation and interfering with nutrient translocation to the leaves [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The high Zn concentration in the biosolid might have affected the assimilation and/or translocation of Fe, which was present in high concentrations in the biosolid but did not accumulate in the leaf tissues, it might have also influenced the leaf Mn content that did not exceed 20% the content in the treatment.</p><p>The nutrient composition of microalgae biomass depends on various cultivation conditions, such as temperature, luminosity, and sewage characteristics. These factors influence the composition of microalgae community, and different species of microalgae have different capacities for nutrient removal [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Additionally, the native species of sanitary sewage are well-adapted to that environment, and changes in the community can occur based on different seasons [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295624.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. While microalgae have shown to have nutrients available for the development of amaranth, wet microalgae contains smaller amounts of these nutrients. Despite the high concentration of micronutrients such as Cu, Fe, Zn and Na in the dry microalgae biomass and in the sludge, there was no significant increase in the leaves. This may indicate that the plant has specific mechanisms to limit the absorption of excess nutrients and avoid physiological damage [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] or the presence of interactions between different nutrients [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295624.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. For example, in the plants that received the biosolid, the high concentration of Zn in the microalgae biomass may have interfered with the assimilation and translocation of nutrients such as Mn and Fe, leading to leaf concentrations lower than the 20% control. It is possible that the foliar concentration of Zn was not high in these treatments, but the inhibition could have occurred in the roots, as demonstrated by [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] where Zn and Cu showed a marked accumulation in the roots in relation to the shoot, which represents a plant strategy to mitigate toxicity by these metals.</p><p>Saline stress conditions can induce nutrient deficiencies in leaves, such Fe and Mn [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Additionally, this condition is often accompanied by an increase in foliar Na concentration and a decrease in K and N [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. However, in the present study, with 8 g of dry microalgae and the treatments with wet microalgae showed an elevated concentration of Na in relation to the control treatments.</p><p>There were no other signs of saline stress conditions, indicating that the nutrient deficiencies found in this study may not be related to salt stress conditions. It is noteworthy that Na is considered an essential nutrient in C<sub>4</sub> plants and is involved in various physiological processes, such as the recovery of phosphoenolpyruvate and the synthesis of chlorophyll [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. For a more precise investigation in relation to the stress caused by nutrition, proline analysis could be a good indicator, as it has been observed that an increase in proline production is related to stress situations [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295624.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Another possibility is that the micronutrients may not have been fully released. According to [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], microalgae can be used as a slow-release organic fertilizer, releasing nutrients gradually. However, the mechanism of nutrient release by microalgae requires further investigation.</p><p>Reclaimed water, in turn, due to the efficiency of nutrient removal by microalgae, has a lower nutrient content compared to the other organic fertilizers in this study. The macronutrient content, mainly N and K, is significant and present in higher concentrations than in the 20% nutrient solution, although nutrient values may vary considerably for reuse water depending on environmental characteristics and the treatment the effluent receives. The values found in this study were similar to those obtained by [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295624.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>], who used conventional treatments, and [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>] whose treatment also occurred with the use of microalgae.</p><p>One of the major concerns regarding the application of fertilizers from the treatment of sanitary sewage is the potential presence of contaminants such as pathogens and heavy metals. Different studies demonstrate the efficiency of microalgae in disinfecting the environment by varying the conditions such as pH and oxygen concentration, and by intra-algal competition for nutrients and light [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295624.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295624.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Moreover, exposure to the sunlight and the drying process at temperatures above 55&#x000b0;C inactivate bacteria such as <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> and disinfect the effluent [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], thus ensuring the safety of products derived from sewage treatment for use in agriculture. The sludge generated from domestic sewage tends to have concentrations below the safety standards established by CONAMA [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295624.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>].</p><p>Plant growth is closely related to the availability of nutrients. The amaranth genus is known for its fast growth, with an accelerated growth phase occurring 30 days after emergence, and reaching physiological maturity 90 days after emergence [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In general, plants that received organic fertilizers together with 20% LA solution showed greater growth throughout the experiment, resulting in higher dry mass production. In addition to any mechanism of interaction between the different nutrients or of existing absorption, the accelerated growth may also indicate nutrient depletion from the organic fertilizers, which may not have been sufficient to meet the plant&#x02019;s nutrient requirements during the entire growth cycle, leading to nutrient deficiencies. Although the mineral content of the reclaimed water was lower than that of the 20% LA control solution, the plants that received only the former produced approximately 27% of the dry mass generated by the latter. This suggests that reclaimed water has potential as a biofertilizer Similarly, plants that received only sludge showed the potential to produce dry mass with the nutrients available in the sludge. Our study aligns with other studies that demonstrated the efficiency of using microalgae, biosolid and reclaimed water as biofertilizers for the growth of various crops [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295624.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295624.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295624.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>].</p><p>The low production of dry mass under pure sludge treatment may attributed to the low supply of K by the sludge, as the plants did not receive 20% LA. K plays an essential role in maintaining water status and the translocation and transformation of sugars, which directly impacts plant growth and development [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295624.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. On the other hand, the low production of dry mass in the treatment that exclusively received the reclaimed water, is mainly due to the deficiency of micronutrients, since Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn are below the concentrations of the 20% LA control, while the other nutrients reached the concentrations of the control treatment. As micronutrients play a crucial role in plant growth, development and metabolism, the deficiency of these essential nutrients negatively impacts dry mass production [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>].</p><p>High levels of chlorophyll are essential for normal photosynthesis in plants. The adequate supply of nutrients, particularly N and Mg, is necessary for the synthesis of chlorophyll, as they are part of the molecule. Plants grown under wet microalgae showed a significant reduction in chlorophyll content even with adequate foliar N and Mg content, indicating that a large portion of these nutrients did not contribute to chlorophyll synthesis. When compared to plants grown under dry microalgae, those grown under wet microalgae had much lower foliar Fe content. Chloroplasts have the highest requirement of Fe in plant cells, comprising up to 80% of the cellular Fe in leaf cells [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Fe is essential for the biosynthesis of chlorophyll and its precursors and for the maintenance of the structure and function of chloroplasts [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Hence, the lower concentrations of Fe in the plants grown under wet microalgae could have been responsible for the reduction in chlorophyll content. The lower photosynthetic pigments in this group of plants may be a consequence of rapid initial growth of plants, leading to rapid exhaustion of available nutrients in the wet microalgae with time. Although excessive Cu and Zn concentrations can significantly reduce chlorophyll content in plants [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295624.ref100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>], this was not observed in plants grown under dry microalgae or sludge, which contained higher concentrations of Cu and Zn. The sludge had four times more Fe than in the dry microalgae in its composition, resulting in a higher content of Fe and chlorophyll in the leaves, highlighting the role of Fe in the chlorophyll biosynthesis. Photosynthetic pigments were consistently higher in crops watered with the treated wastewater [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. In our study, plants cultivated with reclaimed water, chlorophyll content was higher than than those watered with 20% LA, possibly due to the increase in N and Mg levels, which are part of the chlorophyll molecule. Additionally, the observed decrease of carotenoids content in the leaves of plants cultivated under wet microalgae can be attributed to the role of Fe in carotenoid biosynthesis [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>].</p><p>Photosynthesis can be limited by stomatal and non-stomatal factors. If CO<sub>2</sub> conductance is the only factor, limiting photosynthesis, <italic toggle="yes">C<sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub></italic> would be expected to decrease due to CO<sub>2</sub> removal from intercellular spaces and decreased resupply through stomata. However, this was not observed in the plants grown under wet microalgae, where <italic toggle="yes">C<sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub></italic> was increased or maintained at the same values as 20% LA control. This suggests that the reduction in photosynthesis was not solely due to stomatal closure but also due to lower levels of photosynthetic pigments and other non-stomatal limitations. Interestingly, despite the lower photosynthetic rate observed after 43 days of sowing, plants grown under wet microalgae showed an increase in shoot dry matter at the end of the experimental period. The effects of metals on photosynthetic capacity depends on their concentration availability. Lower concentrations of Zn have been shown to increase photosynthetic rate, <italic toggle="yes">g<sub><italic toggle="yes">s</italic></sub></italic>, <italic toggle="yes">E</italic> and chlorophyll levels, while higher concentrations decreased them [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0295624.ref105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Copper is an essential micronutrient for various metabolic processes in plants, but high concentrations can have a toxic effect on photosynthetic and biochemical parameters [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. In our study, however, high doses of Cu and Zn from dry microalgae or sludge did not decrease photosynthesis. On the contrary, photosynthesis increased as the doses of dry microalgae and sludge increased. Our findings are consistent with previous reports that application of sewage sludge can increase photosynthesis, chlorophyll content, and Fe acquisition [<xref rid="pone.0295624.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. While plants grown under sludge supply showed lower <italic toggle="yes">g<sub><italic toggle="yes">s</italic></sub></italic>, photosynthesis increased, resulting in lower <italic toggle="yes">C<sub><italic toggle="yes">i</italic></sub></italic>, indicating effective CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation in the substomatal cavity.

The characterization of the organic fertilizer used in this experiment shows that their nutrient content is unbalanced in relation to plant needs. Despite the nutrient deficiencies observed in some treatments, the application of larger doses of these products significantly increased the aerial biomass production, with dry microalgae being the most effective. The partitioning of dry matter in the leaves was greater than in the stem probably due to N content in the biofertilizers used in this study. While the treatments receiving exclusively reclaimed water or sludge did not surpass the 20% control treatment, they demonstrated the potential for biomass production with the available nutrients. Amendments with dry microalgae and biosolid increased photosynthetic rates with the biosolid being the most effective due to the increase in total chlorophyll content. To optimize initial growth, further investigations are needed to determine the appropriate doses and application rates of these products. Additionally, the high concentrations of micronutrients such as Cu, Fe, Zn, and Na in the biosolids and microalgae biomass require careful consideration to avoid potential stress on plants. Overall, our findings suggest that organic fertilizers from domestic sewage treatment can offer a sustainable solution for nutrient cycling by returning them to the soil and promoting plant growth in nutrient-poor soils.</p></sec><sec id="sec023" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0295624.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Physical-Chemical characteristic of digested sewage.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0295624.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pone.0295624.s002" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Heavy metal concentration of digested sewage.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0295624.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the Department of Water and Sewage/Bauru for allowing us to carry out the research.

Definitely these types of studies offer a sustainable solution for nutrient cycling by returning them to the soil and promoting plant growth in nutrient-poor soils. However, there are some suggestions for the improvement of the submitted article</p><p>Major Suggestions:</p><p>1. The research gap has not been highlighted in the need for project section. So it is suggested to add already work done on the similar aspects and what needed</p><p>2. The statistical analysis is not quite clear. There is need to mention how data has been statistically analyzed separate section.</p><p>Minor Suggestions:</p><p>The minor suggestions is mentioned in the attached file</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;The manucript titled Biofertilizers from wastewater treatment as a potential source of mineral nutrients for</p><p>growth of amaranth plants is very interesting. However, the following justifications are much needed for the mansucript:</p><p>1. Why amaranth plants? Did the authors try with any other plants??</p><p>2. Mention the physiochemical composition of the watewater?</p><p>3. Was heavy metal analysis done for the wastewater?</p><p>4. The authors need to justify the reason for utlization of wastewater and address the constraint with the safety regulation related to the usage of wastewater.</p><p>5. The abstract and conclusion need to be improvised as they are too generalised and no information on the key experimental findings of the research.</p><p>Reviewer #3:&#x000a0;The manuscript evaluates the sewage-grown microalgae as potential biofertilizer. The concept and results are provided in meaningful manner which will help in the real-time implementation of proposed biofertilizer. Various aspects of biofertilizers had been evaluated by authors which is good thing, however few recommendations are given below for the improvement of manuscript, prior to its acceptance for PLOS One Journal.</p><p>&#x02022; It would be interesting to present the quantitative biochemical composition of Amaranthus in the introduction section.</p><p>&#x02022; What was the reason of blocking light radiations during algal growth? Generally, higher light is associated with better nutrient removal and biomass growth.</p><p>&#x02022; Please provide the details of the algal strain which is used in this experiment.</p><p>&#x02022; Usually, algal growth is compromised in the presence of sludge or suspended solids. What was the behavior in present study? Which technique was used to obtain algal biomass in murky wastewater?</p><p>&#x02022; Do the authors perform the safety assessment to evaluate the impact of tannin on biofertilizer, as this information is of importance for real-time application of proposed biofertilizer.</p><p>&#x02022; Authors mentioned that 70% LA promotes the plant growth, then why this condition was not selected for the biofertilizer applications?</p><p>&#x02022; Please provide the full form of abbreviation at the first mention of term.</p><p>&#x02022; Why authors didn&#x02019;t check the combination of reclaimed water and algae, as It would be interesting to evaluate their impact.</p><p>**********</p><p><!-- <font color="black"> -->6.
