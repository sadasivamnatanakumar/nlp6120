Single-country or small observational data suggest differences in clinical phenotype between lineages. We present strain lineage and clinical phenotype data from 12,246 patients from 3 low-incidence and 5 high-incidence countries. We used multivariable logistic regression to explore the effect of lineage on site of disease and on cavities on chest radiography, given pulmonary TB; multivariable multinomial logistic regression to investigate types of extra-pulmonary TB, given lineage; and accelerated failure time and Cox proportional-hazards models to explore the effect of lineage on time to smear and culture-conversion. Mediation analyses quantified the direct effects of lineage on outcomes. Pulmonary disease was more likely among patients with lineage(L) 2, L3 or L4, than L1 (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.79, (95% confidence interval 1.49&#x02013;2.15), p&#x0003c;0.001; aOR = 1.40(1.09&#x02013;1.79), p = 0.007; aOR = 2.04(1.65&#x02013;2.53), p&#x0003c;0.001, respectively). Among patients with pulmonary TB, those with L1 had greater risk of cavities on chest radiography versus those with L2 (aOR = 0.69(0.57&#x02013;0.83), p&#x0003c;0.001) and L4 strains (aOR = 0.73(0.59&#x02013;0.90), p = 0.002). L1 strains were more likely to cause osteomyelitis among patients with extra-pulmonary TB, versus L2-4 (p = 0.033, p = 0.008 and p = 0.049 respectively). Patients with L1 strains showed shorter time-to-sputum smear conversion than for L2. Causal mediation analysis showed the effect of lineage in each case was largely direct. The pattern of clinical phenotypes seen with L1 strains differed from modern lineages (L2-4). This has implications for clinical management and could influence clinical trial selection strategies.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

Pulmonary disease is its most common form, but tuberculosis can disseminate throughout the host and manifest anywhere. Nine separate human adapted <italic toggle="yes">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> lineages are described [<xref rid="pgph.0001788.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0001788.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Each lineage has emerged in its own geographical niche with some so-called specialist lineages having adapted to the host population with which they co-evolved, and other more generalist lineages having successfully spread throughout the world [<xref rid="pgph.0001788.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pgph.0001788.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>For the purpose of clinical trials, most diagnostics, and treatment, TB is still considered one disease rather than a family of different but related entities. However, data suggesting genuine differences exist are accumulating. The minimum inhibitory concentrations for pyrazinamide and pretomanid were recently found to be higher for lineage 1 than for other tested lineages [<xref rid="pgph.0001788.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0001788.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Epidemiological studies into the relationship between lineage and clinical phenotype have in the past indicated that lineage 1 in particular is more strongly associated with extra-pulmonary disease than lineages 2&#x02013;4 [<xref rid="pgph.0001788.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Of late an association and proposed mechanism have even been proposed for how lineage 1 is more likely to result in TB osteomyelitis than other lineages [<xref rid="pgph.0001788.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, observational studies are fraught with potential confounders, such as immigration patterns, and only two small studies have so far simultaneously looked at data from both endemic countries and at countries where the majority of patients can be linked to another country of origin [<xref rid="pgph.0001788.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0001788.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>After decades of limited progress, there are now a wealth of new drugs and even vaccines in the pipeline. Were differences between lineages thought to be major, this would need to be considered when designing clinical studies assessing new interventions. Here we present data from eight countries across four continents to explore the effect of <italic toggle="yes">M</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">tuberculosis</italic> lineage on, and risk factors for, clinical manifestations from the focus of disease to radiological markers of severity to treatment response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Sample selection</title><p>We analysed existing datasets from three low-incidence countries where most patients with TB can be linked to another country of origin, and 5 high-incidence countries where immigration patterns are less relevant to local TB patterns. In each case data had originally been generated for other studies, independent of this one. Data from Germany and the UK are from metropolitan population studies, and include isolates from all patients for whom a culture was available and a lineage determinable over defined time periods. In Germany in particular this resulted in enrichment for pulmonary TB (90% vs. 71% background rate in the country [<xref rid="pgph.0001788.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]). Data from Italy were representative of all patients with pulmonary TB attending a clinic in Milan. Data from China were from a national pulmonary TB prevalence study, and those from South Africa were from a surveillance study of bedaquiline resistance among patients with rifampicin resistant pulmonary TB. Data from Peru are from a locally representative observational study on pulmonary TB. Data from Vietnam and Indonesia originated both from observational studies on pulmonary TB, and from clinical trials on TB meningitis.

No further WGS analysis was conducted here. Outcome variables included locus of disease, cavities on chest radiographs (CXR), Timika scores (the higher the score, the more severe the disease on CXR) [<xref rid="pgph.0001788.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and time to smear and culture conversion. These were all obtained from local clinicians, radiologists and laboratories. We included other variables plausibly effecting outcome, including sex, diabetes, HIV infection, age, isoniazid or rifampicin resistance, country of origin of the data and whether the patient was born in that same country or not. <xref rid="pgph.0001788.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref> shows which datasets contained which variables.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>In order to understand which variables should be included as potential confounders, we developed Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) identifying the hypothesized causal relationships between individual variables (<xref rid="pgph.0001788.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A&#x02013;S1C Fig</xref>). Logistic regression was used to relate the exposure (lineage) to (A) pulmonary vs. extra-pulmonary TB, and (B) the presence of pulmonary cavities in patients with pulmonary TB. In each case age, country of data origin, birth in that country, diabetes and HIV infection were included in the model where these variables were available. As not all datasets included all the same variables, we first analysed each country separately to assess risk factors for the outcome, before performing a causal analysis after pooling data from a subset of countries adjusting for covariates. Confidence intervals and p-values were computed based on the likelihood ratio test and result reported with Firth&#x02019;s correction where numbers were small. Age was included in the models using restricted cubic splines with three knots (the knots were chosen at the 10%, 50% and 90% percentile of the values of the variable) to allow for potential non-linear relationships where applicable. Linear regression was used to examine the effect of lineage on Timika CXR score. As the score had a skewed distribution, we used the Box-Cox procedure to find a suitable transformation (i.e. a square root transformation) that makes the outcome variable more symmetrically distributed. Multivariable multinomial logistic regression was used to analyse the association between lineage and different forms of extra-pulmonary TB with a Wald test to obtain confidence intervals and p-values.</p><p>We investigated the effect of lineage on time to smear and culture conversion using an accelerated failure time model under the assumption of a log-logistic baseline distribution based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) of different parametric fitted models including log-logistic (lowest AIC), exponential, Weibull, gamma and log-normal baseline distribution. The nature of the time-to-event data varied by study so these had to be standardised to achieve a lower and upper bound for the window of time in which smear or culture conversion is likely to have occurred. Where only one date&#x02013;that of a first negative sample&#x02013;was available, this was set as the upper bound of the interval and the lower bound set according to the expected monthly sampling date prior to that (day 0, 30, 60, 90 etc.). Where results from multiple sampling dates were available for a patient, the upper bound was defined as the first of the first two consecutive negatives, and the last preceding positive set as the lower bound. Where the first negative sample was also the last sample documented, this was treated as the conversion date because we assume that there were more samples but they were all negative and therefore not reported. See appendix for further details. We analysed the same data using a Cox proportional-hazards model allowing for interval censored data to explore whether the findings were consistent.</p><p>We conducted causal mediation analyses to investigate the key drivers of our selected outcomes. To this end we focussed on pathways of effects from lineage to outcome, quantifying the effect-size attributable to mediators, rather than just assessing the marginal effect of lineage by standard multivariate models alone. Intermediary and confounding variables were pre-determined from the DAGs (<xref rid="pgph.0001788.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A&#x02013;S1C Fig</xref>). Effects of lineage on outcomes were divided into natural direct and indirect effects via the regression-based approach with closed-form parameter function estimation or direct counterfactual imputation estimation or via the g-formula approach where applicable [<xref rid="pgph.0001788.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0001788.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Direct counterfactual imputation estimation was conducted by fitting a model for the outcome conditional on exposure (<italic toggle="yes">A</italic>), mediator (<italic toggle="yes">M</italic>) and covariates (<italic toggle="yes">C</italic>) using the original dataset, <italic toggle="yes">E(Y|A</italic>,<italic toggle="yes">M</italic>,<italic toggle="yes">C)</italic>. We fitted a multinomial regression model for the distribution of the mediator, conditional on exposure and covariates, and simulated the counterfactuals of the mediator for each value of the exposure. We then imputed the counterfactuals of expected outcome for each individual observation conditional on exposure, imputed mediator values and covariates. The average over the individuals was taken to obtain the counterfactual estimate, and causal -, direct -, indirect -, and total-effects were calculated.</p><p>Exposure-mediator interaction was considered. We also assessed the contribution of the effect of lineage on outcome as operating through mediators, using the &#x0201c;proportion mediated&#x0201d; where applicable, i.e. when direct and indirect effects are in the same direction [<xref rid="pgph.0001788.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

In Germany and Vietnam lineages 2 and 4 were more likely than lineage 1 to associate with pulmonary TB after controlling for immigration, and in the case of Germany, HIV infection and diabetes as well (aOR = 4.88 (95% CI 1.41&#x02013;19.8), p = 0.016 and aOR = 3.16 (1.29&#x02013;7.23), p = 0.008 respectively for Germany; aOR = 1.7 (1.38&#x02013;2.09), p&#x0003c;0.001 and aOR = 2.43 (1.66&#x02013;3.63), p&#x0003c;0.001 respectively for Vietnam).

In Germany, Vietnam and Indonesia we saw the same patterns as in the analysis of risk factors.

To combine data from the 4 countries and still control for age, we needed to impute age for the UK patients. We based this on the mean age in Germany, which a sensitivity analysis showed did not bias the results.

In these data lineage 1 is a risk factor for extra-pulmonary TB, with a suggestion that it favours TB osteomyelitis in particular. When lineage 1 does cause pulmonary TB, we find that it is a risk factor for pulmonary cavities.</p><p>Lineage 1 is ancestral to the other 3 lineages assessed in this study [<xref rid="pgph.0001788.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It is most prevalent in south Asia and has been linked to both extra-pulmonary TB and to more severe disease phenotypes [<xref rid="pgph.0001788.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0001788.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0001788.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It is plausible that the modern lineages (2, 3 and 4) are more adapted to manifesting as pulmonary TB, thereby favouring more transmission [<xref rid="pgph.0001788.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This would have implications for the epidemiology of multi-drug resistant TB given that this may be less common in lineage 1 [<xref rid="pgph.0001788.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Indeed, there is evidence from Vietnam and elsewhere that lineage 1 is being out-competed by the other three global lineages [<xref rid="pgph.0001788.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0001788.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

We however know of few other data to support this hypothesis.</p><p>The results of the causal mediation analyses indicate that the effect of lineage on locus of disease and cavity formation is only minimally mediated through drug resistance. That some effect is mediated through cavity is an intuitive finding given that drug resistance could lead to worse disease where it is more difficult to treat. Although we might have expected to find some effect on time to smear and culture conversion mediated through drug resistance and cavity, this was only observed for time to smear, but not for time to culture conversion.</p><p>Results from observational studies on the association between <italic toggle="yes">M</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">tuberculosis</italic> lineage and clinical phenotype must be treated with caution. Other potential confounders, include host susceptibility, co-morbidities, and local socio-economic circumstances. Most previous studies that we are aware of have focussed only on data from single countries [<xref rid="pgph.0001788.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and those that have focussed on more than one country have been small [<xref rid="pgph.0001788.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pgph.0001788.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We have gathered data from 8 countries and over 12,000 patients. Our data represent both endemic settings and countries where the majority of TB is most likely acquired elsewhere. Although we could not control for all potential confounders, controlling for country of data origin may have captured at least some. Indeed, the recent identification of a potential mechanism for the association between lineage 1 and TB osteomyelitis provides support for our approach and findings [<xref rid="pgph.0001788.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Limitations of our study are that our data were derived from a wide range of studies, each primarily designed for another purpose. Our sampling frames ranged from population prevalence studies to clinical trials, and from studies that included all clinical samples over defined periods of time and space to studies that selected only for one manifestation of disease. These intrinsic biases need to be recognised when constructing each of the presented models. However, none of the studies we pooled data from selected on the basis of lineage as such data could not be known until after the isolates had been analysed. As such, the distribution of lineages within each collection should reflect the lineages&#x02019; natural tendency to result in the outcomes in question, and not any extrinsic selection bias.</p><p>Other limitations include heterogeneity of measurement for individual variables. For example, cavities were reported from CXRs by attending physicians or by radiologists in the different countries without centralised, standardised reporting across the study. Time to smear and culture conversion was reported differently for different studies, with some data sets requiring more assumptions to define time intervals than others. We had no data on second generation immigrants from high to low-burden countries so were unable to control for this potential confounder. Also, no data on patient treatment were available to control for whether they were on effective regimens. As all data were gathered from pre-existing studies, there was no opportunity to remedy this. Despite the inevitable noise in our data, the large size of the combined data set will have helped overcome a degree of random error by increasing power.</p><p>As our understanding of the phenotypic differences between <italic toggle="yes">M</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">tuberculosis</italic> lineages increases, we need to keep re-assessing whether to factor differences into study designs [<xref rid="pgph.0001788.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Increased MICs for pyrazinamide and pretomanid for lineage 1 are clearly relevant to clinical trials of those drugs. Whether different clinical phenotypes should be considered as well remains an open question, but it could be of interest if certain lineages are more prone to cavity formation or different durations to smear or culture conversion as these variables could plausibly impact outcome. Multi-centre, multi-country clinical studies are usually designed to capture diversity across host populations, but it may be that incorporating the full genetic diversity of the pathogen in such studies is equally important.</p></sec><sec id="sec013" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pgph.0001788.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) on the causal assumptions underlying the effect of Lineage on (A) Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB); (B) the presence of Cavity; and (C) Time to culture/smear conversion.</title><p>Arrows indicate the direction of the effect.

</p><p>PGPH-D-23-00405</p><p>The effect of M. tuberculosis lineage on clinical phenotype: a retrospective observational study</p><p>PLOS Global Public Health</p><p>Dear Dr. Walker,</p><p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS Global Public Health. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS Global Public Health&#x02019;s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p><p>After several rounds securing reviewers for your manuscript, we finally completed this process. My apologies on this delay.&#x000a0;</p><p>Before your manuscript can be formally accepted you will need to complete some formatting changes, summarized here:&#x000a0;</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>81. The objective of the study is well described, as well as the analytical framework necessary for the data and variables of interest.</p><p>Methods:</p><p>109. Reference is made to the use of the Timika Score for cavitations in chest X-rays. I recommend including an analysis of the disadvantages of this score and citing it. For example, in reference 14 punctuation is described but its disadvantages are not considered. Might consider:&#x000a0;Chakraborthy A, Shivananjaiah AJ, Ramaswamy S, Chikkavenkatappa N. Chest X-ray score (Timika score): a useful adjunct in predicting treatment outcome in tuberculosis. Adv Respir Med. 2018;86(5):205-210. doi: 10.5603/ARM.2018.0032. PMID: 30378646.</p><p>The statistical analyzes look adequate and consider avoiding bias in the interpretation of the results. Especially when considering the role of lineage 1 in the extrapulmonary manifestations of TB and the greater transmissibility associated with pulmonary TB in the other lineages.</p><p>Results:</p><p>204. As mentioned in the introduction, there are other TB lineages identified, however, for reasons also explained by the authors in this section, these lineages have not been included because they are very rare or poorly represented, however, for didactic reasons I recommend naming them and location.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>423. In this section the authors make some interesting conclusions, especially the possibility that lineages 2, 3 and 4 are associated with pulmonary manifestations and therefore with greater transmissibility. I would recommend placing some reference or including a sentence regarding this important fact, especially considering that in other Latin American countries where there is transmission and circulation of MDR-TB, such as Haiti and the Dominican Republic, this could open the possibility of future phylogenetic analysis. of TB and how TB control programs can focus their strategies.</p><p>In general, I congratulate the authors for this work, I hope they can do another work where the genomic characteristics of this lineage and its role in the expression of the disease can be analyzed in depth.</p><p>In addition, please take a look at reviewers&#x000b4;s notes below.&#x000a0;</p><p>Please note that your manuscript will not be scheduled for publication until you have made the required changes, so a swift response is appreciated.</p><p>Please submit your revised manuscript by .

I appreciate the efforts made to explain the rationale behind the pooling of other existing study datasets, including previously published studies from the same authors (e.g. ref 23) that did not investigate this particular manuscript's hypotheses.</p><p>Although using very diverse and not necessarily comparable datasets at first, the authors appropriately tailored their analyses to extract relevant and statistically valid interpretations, and clearly delineated the limitations of their approach and conclusions.</p><p>I have no hesitation to recommend this manuscript for publication. I have a very minor detail to raise, not that it should impact the recommendation: the abstract refers to 8 lineages of MTB sensu stricto but I'm only aware of 6 lineages (1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8), although the authors might be more in-the-know as to the latest lineages discovered in the recent year.</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;Grateful for the opportunity to review the manuscript "The effect of M. tuberculosis lineage on clinical phenotype: a retrospective observational study" (manuscript number PGPH-D-23-00405 ).</p><p>The study was well designed, and the findings were adequately presented and discussed, including the authors doing very well to acknowledge and carefully describe the limitations of the study.</p><p>In general, studies on the association between M. tuberculosis strain and clinical phenotype are important and should be treated with caution. Congratulations to the authors for the excellent work!</p><p>I recommend publishing this manuscript in PLOS Global Public Health.</p><p>**********</p><p><!-- <font color="black"> -->6.

I congratulate the authors on this important piece of work and appreciate the causal inference approach they took. Pooling observational data from diverse settings and countries is challenging and the authors did well in voicing the limitations of this approach.</p><p>I have a few comments below to improve the manuscript:</p><p>1. The authors could comment on the advantages of using causal mediation analysis to quantify effects of mediators as opposed to multivariate models.</p><p>2. Second generation immigration, i.e. where country of birth is UK or Germany but likely frequent travel to the parents&#x02019; country of birth, could also be an important confounder.</p><p>3. Please use larger fonts in figures</p><p>4. Briefly describe on your imputation approach in the methods section</p><p>5. spelling error L288: that &#x02018;it&#x02019; might behave similar</p><p>6. &#x02018;TB osteomyelitis was significantly more likely than non-meningeal foci of extra-pulmonary TB (&#x0201c;other&#x0201d;) for lineage 1 as compared to lineages 2, 3 and 4 (p=0.032, p=0.01, and p=0.049 respectively. This sentence is unclear since TB osteomyelitis is a non-meningeal focus?</p><p>7. These intrinsic biases need to be recognised when constructing each of the presented models. However, none of the studies we pooled data from selected on the basis of lineage as such data could not be known until after the isolates had been analysed. As such each collection had the opportunity to inform on the distribution of lineages within it.</p><p>The authors adequately described the limitations of pooling data from different studies for their purpose, i.e., by presenting effect estimates from country specific models. However, I think their last statement above is incorrect. The different selected studies, i.e. those studying drug resistant or meningeal TB, will be biased towards lineages if the authors assumption is that underlying lineages differ in resistance profiles and disease presentation.</p><p>**********</p><p><!-- <font color="black"> -->7.
