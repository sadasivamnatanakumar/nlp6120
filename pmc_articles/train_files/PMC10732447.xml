Although several scholars have offered multiple scales to measure engagement, their use has been hindered by significant limitations. This study sought to develop a scale to measure academic engagement by unifying and improving existing work and theories that resulted in a three-dimensional measurement model (behavioral, emotional, and cognitive). The items included were validated by a group of experts who ensured that the wording of the items captured the uniqueness of the college experience. A sample of 992 Mexican college students was used to test the fit of a second-order three-dimensional factor model of school engagement. The sample was randomly split in two for model cross-validation. Confirmatory factor analyses confirmed that student engagement is a three-dimensional construct, with evidence that supports the hypothesized second-order engagement factor structure (behavioral, emotional, and cognitive). The stability of these models was confirmed by using an independent sample. Measurement invariance by gender was found in this model. Then, differences in latent factor means were analyzed. Finally, the scale showed discriminant and concurrent validity. These results indicate that the scale is theoretically and psychometrically grounded for measuring college students&#x02019; school engagement.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source>

The academic engagement has risen as a protective factor against these issues [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Although there is no consensus on the definition of student engagement, scholars agree that it refers to the extent of students&#x02019; attitudes and involvement in school-related learning activities [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although the positive effects of academic engagement on performance and attainment have been widely studied [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], what perhaps should call the most attention is its potential as an antidote against dropouts, which can be prevented through interventions by the school community [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Hence, describing and understanding student academic engagement are two crucial goals for researchers and policymakers. However, efforts to do so have been undermined by considerable variations in the conceptualization and measurement of engagement. This condition makes it hard for scholars to choose the most appropriate instrument and evolve the current understanding of the construct [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>An important long-lasting issue is that multiple terms are used interchangeably to name the construct (e.g., student engagement, school engagement, academic engagement, class engagement, and schoolwork engagement). Such inconsistencies lead to multiple conceptualizations of engagement, reflected in various measurement models, avenues for collecting data, assessment focus (school or learning), and variation in the content of items used in each instrument. Moreover, most current scales tend to capture factors that affect school success (e.g., school goals and self-regulation) rather than indicators of engagement per se. Additionally, these scales often need to define the object in which students engage (e.g., school activities, homework, or learning activities). In line with the above, Finn and Zimmer [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] emphasized that most scales include items that blur the lines between engagement, antecedents, and consequences of engagement; that is, they lie outside the limits of the concept.</p><sec id="sec002"><title>Theoretical approach for measurement academic engagement</title><p>Current measurement variations in school engagement are due to falling under various perspectives and serving different purposes [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In the current literature, two overarching theoretical approaches guide most studies in higher education: behavioral and psychological. The following sections analyze students&#x02019; self-reported measures of engagement development based on these perspectives.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Behavioral approach</title><p>The National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE), formerly known as the College Student Engagement Questionnaire (CSEQ), is by far the most popular instrument for measuring academic engagement in higher education students based on the behavioral perspective [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Although several studies confirm the usefulness of the NSSE in measuring the construct, some scholars [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] argue that the questionnaire is open to criticism, alluding to at least three primary problems. First, the NSSE has an overly broad definition of student engagement and lacks a specific theory that justifies items. Then, a broad range of student performance and outcomes should be included in the scale (e.g., working for a pay-off campus, relaxing, and socializing with friends). Second, several scholars [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] have explored the test structure using EFA and CFA, finding that NSSE&#x02019;s structure did not hold in the U.S. and Canadian samples. For example, using the NSEE, scholars have found eight factors [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], whereas others have reported a three-factor internal structure [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Although it is relatively common that the scale&#x02019;s internal structure varies across different samples, its invariance helps compare the results of the studies on the subject. Third, the NSSE needs to be narrower in scope because it assesses many educational experiences, not precisely engagement. Fourth, we do not know of studies that examined the NSSE measurement invariance by sociodemographic variables, such as gender and race.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Psychological approach</title><p>The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] was designed for work settings and adapted for educational purposes through three dimensions: absorption, dedication, and vigor [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This model is aligned with psychological perspectives and portrays engagement as an internal process while individuals carry out job-related activities. Under this model, studying positive-oriented human and psychological resources remains critical for improving work performance. Although current evidence suggests that the UWES-S presents acceptable psychometric properties, even in Latin American populations [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], scholars warn about two potential issues for its usage in the educational context. First, the UWES-S does not collect critical information about school attendance, such as adherence to classroom norms, following rules, and respect for teaching staff [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Second, the items were developed to measure engagement within the work context; therefore, there are concerns about the adequacy of rephrasing items to measure this construct within the university context [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>The affective, behavioral, and cognitive (ABC) model of attitudes [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] confirmed that the consistency of responses toward the three components might be considered an index of the measured attitude and suggest that each component has distinct antecedents and consequences from those of the others. In line with this framework, other scholars [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] proposed a renewed engagement model that focuses on the emotional processes and cognitive and behavioral efforts invested throughout the learning process and participation in school activities.</p><p>Although inconsistencies in the definitions and number of dimensions of engagement under this model persist, an essential commonality throughout the literature is that engagement is a multidimensional construct [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. However, several studies [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] report mixed results about its internal structure. As a result, engagement is often measured as a two, three, or even four-dimensional construct. For some scholars [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], engagement is a two-dimensional model of emotional and behavioral aspects. As for others [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], engagement is a three-dimensional model comprising cognitive, emotional, and behavioral dimensions. On the other hand, Wang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] assert that engagement is a four-dimensional model that includes cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and social engagement.</p><p>The work conducted by these scholars attempts to fill the current gaps in available scales; however, more efforts are needed. Another essential concern is the alignment of the engagement scope and the unique context in which the population is tested [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], given that engagement is both situational and responsive to the environment [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. It arises from the interaction of context and individual; scholars must ensure that the scales capture student engagement within their specific contexts. In other words, scales comprising items may need to be more appropriate, especially if they are interested in exploring how much engagement varies under specific contextual factors. Thus, scale items must be carefully worded to measure engagement in the specific context of higher education [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p><p>Based on research conducted by other scholars [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], we believe that the current scales of student engagement present at least four critical issues. First, they fall under various perspectives and serve different purposes; therefore, items from the current scales might only partially be accurate for testing student engagement in Mexican universities. Second, in addition to lacking theoretical guidance, some items in the current scales capture factors that affect engagement (antecedents and consequences) rather than indicators of engagement per se [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Third, given that engagement is both situational and responsive to the environment [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], there is an urgency in aligning the scope of student engagement with the unique context in which the population is tested. Moreover, disagreement over the dimensionality of the engagement measure persisted.</p><p>Considering the above, as our colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], we believe appropriate instruments to measure student engagement at different levels and contexts are needed, given that even theory-based and well-thought-out scales have complicated this distinction [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Therefore, developing theoretically grounded, culturally sensitive, and robust psychometric scales is necessary to advance current research and inform practitioners and policymakers accurately.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Gender differences in engagement</title><p>Another essential issue that the literature still needs to address is the need to prove that engagement measurements function similarly across males and females. Although prior research indicates that levels of student engagement may vary significantly by gender [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], some research continues to report mixed results. Whereas a group of scholars [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] found that females are equally engaged as their male counterparts, a recent study [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] reported that males participate more in classes than females. Although several factors may explain such mixed results, it is essential to underline that these findings came from studies that did not prove measurement invariance in the scale used. Thus, such analyses make gender comparisons of engagement inaccurate or dubious at best [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Therefore, ensuring scale invariance between both groups is necessary to increase confidence that the levels of engagement can be compared in future research [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Engagement relationships with external variables</title><p>Academic rigor demands that students invest time in their schoolwork and actively learn meaningful content with high-order thinking at an appropriate level of expectation in a given context [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Academic rigor is greater when learners are taken from mere comprehension toward higher-order thinking through academic activities and dynamics. Academic rigor is a variable influencing academic engagement; it is reflected in higher-order activities that encourage student psychological engagement because it encourages student self-regulation over their learning actions [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Therefore, rigorous academic environments are expected to encourage students to take ownership of their learning and build commitment to in-depth learning. Overall, current literature suggests that student engagement can be influenced by rigor embedded in academic-related activities. Some studies [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] have provided evidence that academic rigor significantly predicts student engagement. Likewise, other studies [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] have reported that academic rigor is a mediating factor in student engagement, which deserves further exploration.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>The present study</title><p>We adopted a psychological approach, given that our study is interested in the psychological processes in students&#x02019; minds and what they think and feel. We foresee our work as an effort that goes beyond &#x0201c;what is observable&#x0201d; and what is measurable. This clarity in our study allowed us to consider the psychological over the behavioral perspective. Based on this framework, this study aims to develop and examine the psychometric properties of the University Students&#x02019; Academic Engagement Scale (USAES) from a three-dimensional psychological perspective [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. While the literature review provided the theoretical basis for defining the domain and its dimensions, qualitative techniques allowed us to move from the abstract point to its manifest form. Thus, to ensure that the University Students&#x02019; Academic Engagement Scale (USAES) items effectively capture the lived experiences of Mexican college students, we conducted focus group work. During the item-generation process, we combined inductive and deductive methods [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In order to have a diverse sample of students across the country, we met students and faculty members from three public universities located in the north (Sonora), center (Nayarit), and south (Chiapas) of the country (three groups of students and three groups of teachers from each university) who volunteered to participate. Our meetings with students included 36 (20 female and 16 male) research participants (12 from each university) from the arts and humanities, engineering, and natural sciences. Similarly, our meetings with faculty members included 18 (11 female and 7 male) research participants (six from each state) who teach social science, engineering, and natural sciences.</p><p>Before the focus group discussions, we informed the research participants about the meaning of engagement and its three factors (behavioral, emotional, and cognitive). Research participants discussed four themes: (a) how truly engaged students behave in daily school days; (b) how truly engaged students connect with the academic community, their peers, and teachers, and the institution itself when they feel studying college is an excellent opportunity they should take advantage of; (c) how truly engaged students manage to learn as much as possible when they know such learning will be helpful in real life, and (d) whether a person can get behavioral, emotional, and cognitively engaged? We performed a thematic analysis of the focus group conversations. As a result, 25 indicators of academic engagement among Mexican college students emerged to assess the construct in three dimensions (behavioral, emotional, and cognitive).</p><p>Subsequently, a group of eight Mexican researchers in higher education and engagement was consulted to ensure that the USAES items aligned with the context and reality of Mexican higher education classrooms. The experts were asked to evaluate the relevance of each item for measuring the behavioral, cognitive, and affective dimensions of engagement on a 4-point rating scale (1 = not relevant to 4 = very relevant). Using the content validity index (I-CVI) method, we experienced a considerable reduction in the item pool. 11 of the 25 original items of the USAES were removed; only 14 items accomplished a content validity index (CVI) greater than .80 [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. This process improved theoretical support and the appropriate selection of situations to measure student engagement within the Mexican context, respecting its antecedents and consequences.</p><p>To examine evidence of the validity of the USAES response interpretation, we addressed the following purposes: (a) assessing the fit of a second-order factor model of academic engagement (see <xref rid="pone.0288012.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>); (b) assessing the measurement model replicability in an independent sample (cross-validation); (c) examining the discriminant validity of USAES factors; (d) analyzing the measurement model invariance by sex; (e) comparing latent mean differences across sex, once appropriate measurement invariance is present; and (f) examining the USAES concurrent validity by assessing its associations with a measure of academic rigor.</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0288012.g001"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0288012.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Factor model of academic engagement depicting a second-order factor model.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0288012.g001" position="float"/></fig><p>We hypothesized that: Hypothesis 1 (internal structure): the items used to measure academic engagement display a second-order factor structure that contains three first-order factors: (a) behavioral dimension that includes indicators of positive conduct such as following the rules, adhering to classroom norms, and the absence of disruptive behaviors; (b) cognitive dimension, which includes items reflecting the internal investment of cognitive energy that students exert to attain above the minimal understanding of the course content; and (c) affective dimension, which comprises indicators of involvement by feeling included in the school community as well as feeling the school is a significant part of their own lives. Hypothesis 2 (cross-validation): An independent sample replicates the internal model structure. Hypothesis 3 (discriminant validity): each dimension of student engagement discriminates from the other scale dimensions. Hypothesis 4 (measurement invariance): the scale is an invariant measure across gender. Hypothesis 5 (latent means comparisons): Female students have higher academic engagement levels than male students.

Therefore, we sought to develop and validate a scale that accurately captures the engagement of Mexican students by unifying and improving existing work and theories in the field. The USAES items were validated by a group of experts who ensured that the wording captured the uniqueness of the college experience. Together, the improvements in this new scale have a wide range of possible applications for the instrument, which may contribute to advancing research in the field.

Consistent with previous research [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], we found no significant differences between males and females regarding emotional and cognitive engagement. Regardless of these results, future research should address gender differences using valid-invariant scales. Indeed, such research would shed light on the blurred relationship between gender and school engagement. Research may contribute to a better understanding of the underpinnings of school engagement and its effects on students.</p></sec><sec id="sec032"><title>Evidence of external validity</title><p>Our findings confirm what other scholars [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] have consistently suggested: the academic culture significantly influences students&#x02019; engagement. In addition, the data provide evidence supporting concurrent validity. Specifically, our results suggest a positive association between academic rigor and engagement, a relationship theoretically proposed in the literature yet poorly explored [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Therefore, this finding is relevant because it supports theorists who assert that academic rigor, reflected in higher-order thinking activities, can encourage student engagement.</p></sec><sec id="sec033"><title>Theoretical and practical implications</title><p>These results have substantive methodological implications for scholars interested in school engagement. Similar to other studies [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0288012.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], our results confirm that school engagement is a second-order factor comprising three first-order factors: behavioral, emotional, and cognitive. Even more critically, they confirm the value of the three-dimensional model proposed by Fredericks et al. [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and its replicability across different populations. The study also confirmed the value of using well-focused and contextualized items to assess school engagement. However, future research should be conducted using invariant scales and focus on examining the factors that lead individuals to different types of engagement (behavioral, emotional, and cognitive) and their effects on students in and out of school.</p><p>From a practical perspective, using the USAES, scholars may identify the underpinnings of school engagement, which can be targeted with future school interventions to benefit students. School interventions are supported using the USAES because they provide more accurate and valid inferences. Likewise, it is an instrument that may be used to identify which type of engagement (behavioral, emotional, and cognitive) brings better effects on students, in and out of school, to intervene accordingly. More importantly, the USAES may provide valuable information to administrators and policymakers to implement more effective educational programs.</p></sec><sec id="sec034"><title>Limitations</title><p>Some limitations of this study should be noted. First, the study design (cross-sectional) needs to assess students&#x02019; engagement throughout the college experience. Thus, longitudinal studies are necessary to examine changes in engagement over time. Second, the results rely on self-reported data; personal biases may have influenced students&#x02019; responses. Further studies should explore the relationships between USAES responses with measures that include different data sources (e.g., teachers or peers) and measurement methods (e.g., observation) to expand the scale&#x02019;s usefulness in measuring academic engagement among university students. Moreover, even though we made a considerable effort to replicate the study population&#x02019;s structure to obtain a sample that can be considered representative, we acknowledge a high risk of bias. Third, these findings are specific to different regions of Mexico. It is imperative to acknowledge that students from universities that attend rural and indigenous schools may have different experiences with school engagement. As a result, the conclusions can only be generalized to Mexico&#x02019;s data collection area. Fourth, although we demonstrated measurement invariance by gender, examining the measurement invariance of other sociodemographic variables is necessary to compare other groups. Five, the reported effect size of the relationships of academic engagement&#x000b4;s dimensions and academic rigor is based on Cohen&#x000b4;s guides, but it is arbitrary [<xref rid="pone.0288012.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. These results should be compared with future studies that use similar designs in Mexican adolescent to test more accurately the effect size. Finally, although the USAES was explicitly developed to consider the Mexican context, we suggest cross-cultural studies to assess the replicability of the instrument in other populations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec035"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study provides a theoretical and highly scrutinized instrument with robust validity for assessing school engagement as a second-order factor comprising three first-order factors: behavioral, emotional, and cognitive. The USAES shows improvement in assessing each dimension of engagement, which contributes to identifying the antecedents and consequences of school engagement in students. The USAES is a suitable tool in higher education that should be adapted for use with different Mexican samples of university students and countries. However, such a process requires an examination of scale measurement invariance in these samples.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to express our deep gratitude to the Department of Education of the Technologic Institute of Sonora and the Department of Social Work of the University of California Fresno for their significant support throughout the research process.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0288012.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">

While the authors have provided some explanations about the procedures of the development of the scale, and the decisions about the data-analytic procedures and results, I have some concerns or suggestions about those choices that are shown below. I also have some suggestions about how to justify the development of the scale instead of focusing on their perceived limitations of the existing scales that measure engagement. In addition, the authors should provide more details regarding the theoretical frameworks, conceptual models, and operational definitions of their measured construct.

I believe a common practice for examining scale validation is that researchers would test and examine various factor structures that have been found in previous studies and conclude the one that has the best data fit to their study sample, with the goal to accumulate empirical evidence across replications.</p><p>Line 69: &#x0201c;it assesses many educational experiences not specifically engagement&#x0201d; &#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0e0; --> Give examples to support your view.</p><p>Line 100: &#x0201c;It seems that given engagement is fundamentally situational; it arises from the interaction of context and individual; scholars must ensure that the scales can capture student engagement within their specific contexts. That is, scales comprising items may not be appropriated, especially if they are interested in exploring how much engagement varies under specific contextual factors. Thus, scale items must be carefully worded to measure engagement in the specific context of higher education&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0e0; --> I believe that this argument is over-stated. First, I am not 100% sure whether the existing literature does not offer any scale that measurement &#x0201c;situational engagement within a context&#x0201d; (I believe there should be some). Second, even if no scale is currently available, previous research may focus on measuring &#x0201c;general&#x0201d; engagement that is conceptualized as a general, psychological trait (e.g., extroversion/introversion of a person based on the Big Five personality). Hence, measuring the construct of &#x0201c;general&#x0201d; engagement should not be regarded as a criticism leading to the current study. Third, I found that there are some other places in which the authors argue that most current, widely employed engagement scales (e.g., UWES-S; lines 87 to 95) are less than optimal because of the mixed results regarding their factor structures. Indeed, validating a scale across different samples in different research settings or labs adheres to the principle of accumulating empirical evidence in science, and it is relatively common among different researchers to observe different factor structures of the same scale (e.g., due to many factors such as culture differences, translation of the scale questions, etc.). In a hypothetical scenario, when future researchers intend to test and validate the proposed USAES based on other samples, it is likely that the USAES would also be found with mixed results (e.g., various factor structures). Or, stated differently, the existing literature does not provide any empirical evidence that the USAES has been comprehensively tested and validated (other than the current sample of n = 992 university students in Mexico) to possess more appropriate psychometric properties (e.g., the same factor structure, high reliability, etc.) than most other current scales (e.g., UWES-S).</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0e0; --> In my view, there is no need to criticize &#x0201c;how bad&#x0201d; the current scales are in measuring engagement, and hence, the authors would like to propose and develop a new one. Rather, the tone should be softened, and the authors could directly state that their goal is to develop an engagement scale that measure students&#x02019; engagement within specific contexts based on their theoretical framework and conceptual models. Indeed, their paragraphs under the heading: &#x0201c;Theoretical Framework for Measurement Academic Engagement&#x0201d; is a bit misleading because I anticipate that the authors should state their theoretical framework for engagement. For example, what are the existing psychological theories that conceptualize &#x0201c;engagement in a specific context&#x0201d;? How do those theories explain the behavioral, emotional, and cognitive aspects of engagement? Why does the authors select or focus on one theory (if any) that directs them to develop the proposed USAES? After selecting a particular theoretical framework, what conceptual models do they propose (e.g., a conceptual diagram including all the paths that link the antecedents such as academic rigor; line 137) and outcomes?</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0e0; --> Regarding &#x0201c;academic rigor&#x0201d; (lines 136 &#x02013; 139), this section should be expanded. For example, what is the literature review about academic rigor? Why is only one antecedent or predictor selected in this study to predict engagement?</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0e0; --> In sum, the current literature review focuses on discussing the authors&#x02019; perceived weaknesses of the existing scales that measure engagement without any details (e.g., theoretical frameworks, conceptual models, operational definition, etc.) about their proposed construct. Indeed, I am not 100% sure about the concept or meaning of the proposed construct (should it be &#x0201c;student engagement in specific contexts&#x0201d;? If that is the case, what types of students (e.g., undergraduate, graduate, university students, or others) do they focus on? What &#x0201c;specific contexts&#x0201d; do they refer to?</p><p>Line 124 &#x02013; 125: &#x0201c;Another important issue that has not been addressed in literature is the need to prove that engagement measurement functions similarly across males and females.&#x0201d; &#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0e0; -->This statement assumes that the variable is gender or a dichotomous view of gender with the categories of males and females only. Line 128: &#x0201c;&#x02026;found women are equally engaged as their male counterparts&#x02026;&#x0201d; &#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0e0; --> The word &#x0201c;women&#x0201d; appears that the authors refer to the &#x0201c;biological sex&#x0201d; of participants. There is some confusion about whether the authors refer to gender, e.g., males/females; gender orientation/tendency that is different from biological sex (e.g., men/women).</p><p>Line 146: &#x0201c;members from three public universities located in the north (Sonora)&#x0201d;</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0e0; --> How many public universities are there in Mexico? Does the number of 3 ensure that this is a representative sample? As noted above, there is no need to over-state the representativeness, as no study is perfectly or truly based on random sampling. The authors could directly mention their sampling procedure instead of stating that having "a presentative sample from students all over the country".</p><p>Line 161: &#x0201c;From these focus group conversations, 25 indicators of academic engagement&#x0201d; &#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0e0; --> This part misses the details of the qualitative data analysis. E.g., coding, thematic analysis, inter-coder reliability, etc. Please provide the details.</p><p>Line 162: &#x0201c;Then, a group of eight experts in higher education&#x0201d; &#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0e0; --> What are their background, and who are they?</p><p>Line 167: &#x0201c;The review by experts ensured high quality and the relevance of the USAES items in alignment with the context and reality of Mexican higher education classrooms&#x0201d;. &#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0e0; --> This statement seems to be over-stated without the details of the processes that provide scientific evidence and support regarding why and how the experts could ensure &#x0201c;high quality&#x0201d; of the USAES items. &#x0201c;This process led to a considerable reduction of the item pool. In total, 11 of 25 original items of the USAES were removed; only 14 items accomplished a content validity index (CVI) greater than .80 [57]. &#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0e0; --> Similarly, no evidence has been provided regarding the criteria and processes that delete the 11 items (e.g., based on what approach/method/criteria?)</p><p>Line 213: &#x0201c;I do attend all my classes, labs, practices&#x0201d; &#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0e0; --> Were the items presented in English or Mexican language?</p><p>Line 244: &#x0201c;using robust weighted least squares (DWLS)&#x0201d; Why did the authors use DWLS instead of the default estimator maximum likelihood with robust standard error in MPlus?

Also, .70 is not high, and it is interpreted as marginal to reasonable reliability. This finding may also suggest that the proposed USAES may not necessarily have better reliability than current scales such as USAES. Or the authors should at least provide the reliability coefficients of other current scales for comparison.</p><p>Line 314: &#x0201c;The goodness of fit of second-order factor model (Model B) was not statistically better (&#x00394;SBX2 = 8.54, &#x00394;df = 1, p = .003; &#x00394;BIC = 6.83) than&#x0201d; &#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0e0; --> It states: &#x0201c;was not statistically better&#x0201d;, but the p value is .003 which is significant at the .05 level (or p &#x0003c; .05).</p><p>Reviewer #2:&#x000a0;The manuscript is well written. The author/s clearly outlined the justification for the conducted research (i.e., development of the Academic Engagement Scale in Mexican context). Both the theoretical rationale and the presented results make a valuable contribution: provide a new &#x0201c;theoretically-grounded, culturally sensible, and robust&#x0201d; psychometric tool and explain the context of its use in future research as well as educational practice. The study is well designed, and the statistical analyses properly selected and reported. Please find my few minor comments below.</p><p>1. The author/s defined three facets of an academic engagement, i.e., behavioral, emotional, and cognitive. However, in the theoretical part, they do not refer to the most common model, known as the ABC model of attitudes (see Ostrom, 1969) that includes these three components. Then it is necessary to specify to what extent academic engagement is derived from the theory of attitudes. This clarification may shed more light on the understanding of this phenomenon.</p><p>2. The author/s undertook to study the measurement invariance of the USAES across genders, however, it would be advisable to comment on the equivalence of this tool in the context of its use in different types of schools and in different cultures. Can the developed tool be adapted to other countries in the future? Is it possible to adapt the tool to the conditions of other schools (secondary, primary)? What are the authors' recommendations?</p><p>3. Did the authors use the robust Weighted Least Squares (robust WLS) or DWLS (Diagonally Weighted Least Squares) estimation? I am belief that the choice of the DWLS estimator was not the most optimal one but probably robust WLS was used in the study. A brief justification for the choice of the estimator is needed.</p><p>4. Since the factor structure showed the second-order engagement factor, the general score should be included in the latent means comparison by gender as well as in the correlations between academic engagement dimensions and academic rigor.</p><p>5. The results presented in Table 6 show that affective academic engagement and cognitive academic engagement correlate more strongly with academic rigor than with the behavioral component of academic engagement. Could this have implications for distinguish the three components of the academic engagement.</p><p>Ostrom, T. M. (1969).

You are right. Multiple predictors deserve to be further explored in current and emerging studies; however, unlike other demographic factors (race, parental education, socioeconomic status), gender is a demographic factor that consistently reports mixed studies. Such findings came from studies that did not prove the measurement invariance in the scale used. Therefore, ensuring the scale invariance between both genders is critical to bring higher confidence to future research and, hopefully, some consistency in their results. We included in the Limitation section the need for examined invariance across other groups.</p><p>Please, see </p><p>&#x02022; Kinzie J, Thomas AD, Palmer MM, Umbach PD, Kuh GD.

In a hypothetical scenario, when future researchers intend to test and validate the proposed USAES based on other samples, it is likely that the USAES would also be found with mixed results (e.g., various factor structures). Or, stated differently, the existing literature does not provide any empirical evidence that the USAES has been comprehensively tested and validated (other than the current sample of n = 992 university students in Mexico) to possess more appropriate psychometric properties (e.g., the same factor structure, high reliability, etc.) than most other current scales (e.g., UWES-S).</p><p>&#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0e0; --> In my view, there is no need to criticize &#x0201c;how bad&#x0201d; the current scales are in measuring engagement, and hence, the authors would like to propose and develop a new one. Rather, the tone should be softened, and the authors could directly state that their goal is to develop an engagement scale that measure students&#x02019; engagement within specific contexts based on their theoretical framework and conceptual models. Indeed, their paragraphs under the heading: &#x0201c;Theoretical Framework for Measurement Academic Engagement&#x0201d; is a bit misleading because I anticipate that the authors should state their theoretical framework for engagement. For example, what are the existing psychological theories that conceptualize &#x0201c;engagement in a specific context&#x0201d;? How do those theories explain the behavioral, emotional, and cognitive aspects of engagement? Why does the authors select or focus on one theory (if any) that directs them to develop the proposed USAES? After selecting a particular theoretical framework, what conceptual models do they propose (e.g., a conceptual diagram including all the paths that link the antecedents such as academic rigor; line 137) and outcomes?</p><p>In sum, the current literature review focuses on discussing the authors&#x02019; perceived weaknesses of the existing scales that measure engagement without any details (e.g., theoretical frameworks, conceptual models, operational definition, etc.) about their proposed construct. Indeed, I am not 100% sure about the concept or meaning of the proposed construct (should it be &#x0201c;student engagement in specific contexts&#x0201d;? If that is the case, what types of students (e.g., undergraduate, graduate, university students, or others) do they focus on? What &#x0201c;specific contexts&#x0201d; do they refer to?</p><p>Response</p><p>We rewrote text to attended the reviewer suggestion. Also, we justified the theoretical approach adopted in the study.

Actually, what we try to explain in this paragraph is the item-generation process, which was voluntarily supported not only for three public universities located in the north of the country (in Sonora) but also by research participants from universities located in the center (Nayarit) and the south of the country (Chiapas)&#x02014;12 universities in total. .

</p><p>Reviewer 1 </p><p>Comment</p><p>Lines 113 &#x02013; 115: &#x0201c;Although prior research indicates that levels of student engagement may vary significantly by &#x02018;biological sex&#x02019; [46-48], some research continues to report mixed results. Whereas a group of scholars [49] found that females are equally engaged as their male counterparts&#x0201d;</p><p>Response</p><p>We have addressed the reviewer&#x02019;s suggestion; please see lines 113-115.</p><p>Comment</p><p>Lines 335 &#x02013; 338: &#x0fffd;<!-- &#x0f0e0; --> Which omega coefficient did you report (e.g., omega-total, omega hierarchical, or others; Trizano-Hermosilla et al., 2021)? Please label your symbols more precisely here.</p><p>Response</p><p>We specify that the reported omega is the total omega coefficient (&#x003c9;).</p><p>Comment</p><p>While it is common that researchers use some thresholds (or &#x0201c;t-shirt&#x0201d; sizes) to interpret an effect size, recent studies (e.g., Bakker, et al., 2019) have suggested that this is an inappropriate or inadequate approach (e.g., the criteria for small, medium, and large effect sizes should vary across different disciplines, etc.). I suggest that you should mention this in the limitations section.</p><p>Response</p><p>We acknowledge that there is endless debate on this interpretation. Therefore, we have included this aspect as a limitation in the Discussion section as follows:</p><p>Fifth, the reported effect size of the relationships between academic engagement dimensions and academic rigor is based on Cohen&#x000b4;s guides, but it is arbitrary [85]. These results should be compared with those of future studies that use similar designs in Mexican adolescents to test the effect size more accurately.</p><p>Comment</p><p>Can you provide the citations and discuss the reasons for using .001 as the level of significance for comparing nested models? Using a more stringent .001 (instead of .05) level for testing the differences between two models seem to decrease the likelihood to signal any significant differences of the fit between the two models. In other words, it is more likely to conclude that the two models have the &#x0201c;same&#x0201d; fit (or the two models are identical in terms of their goodness-of-fit levels to your data), unless they have very or super large differences in the population.</p><p>Response</p><p>We agree with you. Therefore, as suggested by the reviewer, we used a .05. However, this value did not change the interpretation that SBX2 is sensitive to sample size, and we relied on the values of other fit indexes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="aggregated-review-documents" id="pone.0288012.r005" specific-use="decision-letter"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0288012.r005</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 2</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mahmoud</surname><given-names>Ali B.</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2023 Ali B.
