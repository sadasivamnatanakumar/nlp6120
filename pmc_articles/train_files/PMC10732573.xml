Current first-line treatment regimens for chronic ITP include corticosteroids or intravenous high-dose immunoglobulins (IVIg) in certain cases to treat patients with a high bleeding risk.<sup>[<xref rid="j_jtim-2023-0106_ref_003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="j_jtim-2023-0106_ref_004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="j_jtim-2023-0106_ref_005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> However, both corticosteroids and IVIg are associated with transient efficacy and obvious toxicity, and relapse after discontinuation is common.[6] In addition, evidence suggests that approximately 30% of patients with ITP treated with corticosteroids do not achieve an initial platelet response, and more than 95% report adverse effects such as hypertension, hyperglycemia, and acute gastric mucosal lesions, and some patients with long-term use of corticosteroids may develop osteoporosis or femoral head necrosis.[7,8] The choice of treatment for patients with ITP requires careful weighing of the benefits and potential risks of these treatment options.</p><p>Our understanding of the pathophysiology and therapeutic approaches for ITP has deepened significantly over the last few decades. Thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) are a novel class of ITP therapeutics that not only promote the production of platelets from existing megakaryocytes but also stimulate megakaryocytosis in the bone marrow, resulting in an increase in platelet count.[9-11] ITP-related national and international guidelines explicitly recommend TPO-RAs as key options for second-line treatment.[3-5] Currently, five TPO-RAs, including eltrombopag, avatrombopag, heterotrombopag, recombinant human thrombopoietin (rhTPO), and romiplostim.[12,13] Among them, romiplostim (Nplate<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), a recombinant thrombopoiesis-stimulating Fc-peptide fusion protein, was the first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved second-generation TPO-RA for the treatment of chronic ITP in adults<sup>[<xref rid="j_jtim-2023-0106_ref_014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> and was approved in China in January 2022. A substantial number of clinical trial results have confirmed that romiplostim administered once weekly through subcutaneous injection induces a durable platelet response with a rapid onset of action and minimal adverse events in adult ITP patients.<sup>[<xref rid="j_jtim-2023-0106_ref_015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="j_jtim-2023-0106_ref_016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="j_jtim-2023-0106_ref_017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="j_jtim-2023-0106_ref_018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="j_jtim-2023-0106_ref_019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="j_jtim-2023-0106_ref_020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup></p><p>QL0911, a recombinant human thrombopoietin-mimetic peptide-Fc fusion protein for injection, is a biosimilar to romiplostim (Nplate<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) developed by Qilu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. for the treatment of chronic ITP in adults and other indications. Preclinical studies of QL0911 revealed that it was highly consistent with licensed romiplostim in terms of structure, physicochemical properties, biological activity, and pharmacokinetics (PK), and that it was well tolerated without severe drug-related toxicity (data submitted for publication). A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation, phase I clinical trial in healthy volunteers demonstrated the safety and tolerability of a single subcutaneous injection of QL0911 at a dose of 0.3&#x02013;2 &#x003bc;g/kg (Table S1 and Figure S1). The dosage regimen in another Ib study was designed as dose escalation (1, 3, and 6 &#x003bc;g/kg), continuous treatment (up to 12 weeks at adjustable doses, up to 10 &#x003bc;g/kg), and treatment expansion (up to 24 weeks at adjustable doses, up to 10 &#x003bc;g/kg) phase. Preliminary results showed that multiple doses of QL0911 were safe and well-tolerated in patients with ITP, and 72.0% (18/25) of the patients had at least one platelet response after receiving QL0911 (data submitted for publication).

The results of this phase III study confirm its safety and efficacy. A durable platelet response was achieved in 89 of the 144 (61.8%) patients treated with QL0911. QL0911 was significantly superior to the placebo at an initial dose of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg once weekly for all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints during the double-blind 24-week treatment period.</p><p>Splenectomy is the second-line treatment for ITP with a high response rate. In clinical practice, splenectomy rates declined with the availability of rituximab and TPO-RAs.<sup>[<xref rid="j_jtim-2023-0106_ref_021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> Consistent with this trend, the proportion of patients who had undergone prior splenectomy was low in this study (9.3%). Although a statistical test was not performed for the subgroups in patients with or without prior splenectomy, QL0911 showed consistent superiority to the placebo in inducing a durable platelet response. Moreover, no difference in the rate of durable platelet response was observed between patients with splenectomized and nonsplenectomized ITP assigned to QL0911.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the efficacy of a romiplostim (Nplate<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) biosimilar in Chinese patients with chronic ITP. Although direct comparison with romiplostim (Nplate<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) was not included in this study, the primary efficacy endpoint, as well as secondary efficacy endpoints used in this study are the same as that used in the phase III study of romiplostim (Nplate<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>). In patients without a previous splenectomy, 61.8% of the QL0911 group achieved durable platelet responses, which were numerically similar to those reported for romiplostim (Nplate<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>). The overall response rate, which was less strictly defined in non-splenectomized patients (84%), was comparable to that of romiplostim (Nplate<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>).[15] The same trend was observed for another secondary efficacy endpoint, including the number of weeks with platelet response, platelet count at each visit, and the proportion of patients receiving rescue therapies. Therefore, QL0911 demonstrated a trend toward clinical equivalence with romiplostim (Nplate<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) in a Chinese patient population with chronic ITP.</p><p>Safety data from the present study demonstrated that QL0911 was well tolerated and no new safety signals were identified. The overall incidence of TEAEs was comparable between the QL0911 and placebo groups (91.7% and 88.9%, respectively). Most events were mild-to-moderate and appeared to be related to the underlying disease. For patients assigned to QL0911, the incidence of severe bleeding events (grade &#x02265; 3) was low (0%&#x02013;2%). Thromboembolic events were not observed during QL0911 treatment, which was also uncommon in patients receiving romiplostim (Nplate<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>).[15]</p><p>In patients with ITP, the goal of treatment is to increase the platelet count to a safe level by minimizing bleeding. However, in clinical practice, patients with ITP do not always respond to first-line treatment with corticosteroids or IVIg. Currently, among the five TPO receptor agonists for the treatment of ITP that have been marketed worldwide, romiplostim, the only peptide TPO-RA, has a peptide domain that binds to the TPO receptor and stimulates platelet production, and the carrier antibody Fc domain can prolong the circulation half-life.[1,14,22] Romiplostim (Nplate<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), a long-acting TPO-RA requiring once-weekly dosing, was approved in China in January 2022. The rise in biosimilars offers exciting opportunities to improve healthcare sustainability and allows patients to benefit from more treatment options.[23] Owing to the superior efficacy and safety of romiplostim in ITP and considering the limited treatment options, there is more interest in Nplate<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> biosimilar, although there are still multiple challenges in the development and adoption of biosimilars.[24,25] To the best of our knowledge, QL0911 is the first Nplate<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> biosimilar in China to undergo a phase III clinical study.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this phase III trial confirmed that QL0911 at a starting dose of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg once weekly was superior to placebo in increasing platelet counts and maintaining a durable platelet response during a 24-week double-blind treatment period in adults with ITP and was well tolerated. QL0911 as a biosimilar of romiplostim (Nplate<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) may be a new treatment option for ITP patients with failure or relapse from first-line treatment in China.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material position="float" content-type="local-data"><caption><p>Supplementary material</p></caption><media xlink:href="jtim-2023-0106_sm.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="j_jtim-2023-0106_ack_001"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the patients and their families for making this study possible, and we thank all participating sites and investigators.
