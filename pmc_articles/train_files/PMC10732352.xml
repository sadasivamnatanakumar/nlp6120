Unfortunately, TB exhibits varied clinical manifestations, making its diagnosis challenging. Occasionally, some patients do not exhibit significant symptoms until they have a substantial disease burden (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). A recent study found that 30% of TB patients diagnosed in the community-basis were completely asymptomatic (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Those patients at risk of delayed diagnosis are also at risk of being a potential source of infection (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In South Korea, screening for TB using chest radiography is regularly performed for health insurance subscribers as part of their health examination (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In addition, new employees of healthcare institutions, schools, and social welfare facilities are required to undergo TB screening tests (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The specific infectivity of subclinical TB is unclear; however, it is contagious and may play a significant role in TB transmission (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of subclinical TB and compare the clinical characteristics and microbiological burden in subclinical and active symptomatic TB patients to better understand the population in the gray zone. Additionally, to enhance comprehension of the disease progression process from asymptomatic to overt symptomatic disease, we attempted to describe the characteristic differences regarding specific TB-related symptoms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Study participants</title><p>In South Korea, all physicians are required to report the diagnosis and treatment of TB at the time of the initial diagnosis, and TB nurse specialists monitor until treatment completion as part of the national public-private mix (PPM) TB control project. We constructed the &#x0201c;Korea TB cohort database,&#x0201d; a prospective observational registry database of the reported TB patients (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Between July 2018 and June 2019, data on patients diagnosed with pulmonary TB were collected from all PPM hospitals. Baseline characteristics were recorded such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking and alcohol consumption history, history of TB, comorbidities, and TB-related symptoms including cough/phlegm, dyspnoea, chest pain, haemoptysis, fever, general weakness, and weight loss. In addition, microbiological test findings, including sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and culture, were collected. AFB culture positivity referred to cases with cultured <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> from respiratory specimens; <italic>non-tuberculous mycobacteria</italic> were excluded. The radiographic findings of presence or absence of cavities and severity of disease were determined using chest radiography or computed tomography.</p></sec><sec><title>Definitions</title><p>Subclinical TB was defined as disease caused by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> without any TB-related symptoms but with detectable abnormalities in radiologic or microbiological assays that could be used to diagnose active TB disease (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Active symptomatic TB was defined as TB with at least one of the following TB-related symptoms: including cough/phlegm, dyspnoea, chest pain, haemoptysis, fever, general weakness, or weight loss with radiological or microbiological evidence of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The presence of symptoms was evaluated by TB nurse specialists and attending physicians. In South Korea, chest radiography is regularly performed for the general population as part of health checkups or pre-employment examinations. If any radiologic abnormalities are detected, additional evaluation including sputum microbiological testing is conducted at the local public health center or referral hospitals. During this process, active TB could be diagnosed even without typical TB-related symptoms, and such cases were categorized as subclinical TB. The subsequent diagnostic pathway after suspicion of TB was not different in subclinical and symptomatic TB groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>This study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The Institutional Review Board of Ilsan Paik Hospital, Inje University approved the study protocol (IRB No. ISPAIK 2021-08-012) and waived the need for informed consent since none of the patients was at risk. The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) is authorized to collect and analyse surveillance data for public health and research purposes. The KDCA approved data use and provided them without personal identification information.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Patient characteristics were presented as mean and standard deviation for continuous variables and relative frequencies for categorical variables. Continuous variables were compared using <italic>t-</italic>tests or analysis of variance, and categorical variables were compared using the chi-square or Fisher's exact test. A correlation network was constructed using Pearson's correlation, wherein each variable was represented by a specific node, and the node size indicated the prevalence. Links between nodes indicated significant associations (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), and the edge thickness represented the strength of correlation (Pearson's R coefficient), with blue and pink indicating positive and negative correlations, respectively. The igraph package was used to visualize the correlation networks. The change in TB-related symptoms with age was fitted by the locally weighted scatterplot smoothing method, a non-parametric strategy for fitting a smooth curve through points in a scatter plot. Multivariable analysis for symptom development was performed using logistic regression. Each model for TB-related symptoms incorporated independent variables such as age, sex, BMI, and significant variables in each univariable analysis at <italic>P</italic> values &#x0003c;0.1. The best model was selected using the backward elimination method. All statistical analyses were performed using R software (version 4.3.1, <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Baseline characteristics</title><p>During the study period, 4,636 patients with pulmonary TB were enrolled.

In our cohort, the prevalence of subclinical TB in South Korea was 37.1 %, with positivity rates of AFB smear and culture of 16.2 and 50.2%, respectively. Subclinical TB patients had a lower proportion of AFB smear and culture positivity than active TB patients; however, considerably high rate of AFB positive results were observed, which emphasizes the need to active search for this population that might be potential sources of infection. For each symptom, demographics, underlying comorbidities, radiographic features, and microbiologic burdens were inter-related, suggesting a mechanism for progression to full-blown disease. The most remarkable finding of our study was that each symptom was not only associated with a microbiological burden as represented by sputum AFB smear grade but also with different demographic characteristics, including age, sex, social factors, and various comorbidities.</p><p>In a multicentre drug-susceptible TB cohort in Korea, Min et al. (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) reported that the positivity of sputum AFB smear and culture were 13.6 and 46.2%, respectively, similar to our results. Moreover, advanced age was a significant factor for development of active TB. A recent large retrospective cohort study in Canada reported that the proportion of patients aged 15&#x02013;64 years was higher in subclinical TB (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The Suzhou study also discovered that the prevalence of subclinical TB decreased substantially with age (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Likewise, we discovered that subclinical TB patients were significantly younger, however, age was found to act differently for each TB-related symptom. The higher probability of early detection of subclinical TB could be attributable to frequent health check-ups at school or work for younger patients. Considering the distinct effect of age, active surveillance is also required to older population for early TB diagnosis.</p><p>Subclinical TB was more prevalent in women in a recent Zambia study (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), whereas Min et al. reported that it was more prevalent in men. We discovered no significant association between subclinical TB and sex; however, the symptoms of cough/phlegm and weight loss were independently associated with the female and male sex, respectively. The association between subclinical TB and sex requires further investigation.</p><p>In a study conducted in Zambia (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), the probability of subclinical TB increased with socioeconomic status. Similarly, the proportion of patients with Medicaid support was lower in the subclinical TB group in our study, suggesting a true association between lower socioeconomic status and active symptomatic TB. Haemoptysis and general weakness were more frequently observed in patients who consumed excessive alcohol. In addition, patients receiving Medicaid support experienced more severe symptoms, such as dyspnoea, fever, and general weakness, reflecting a delayed diagnosis due to poor access to medical facilities. This raises the need to pay attention toward this vulnerable population.</p><p>The incidence of comorbidities, including diabetes and chronic lung and brain diseases, was lower in the subclinical TB group, suggesting the rapid progression to active TB in patients with impaired immunologic response due to underlying comorbidities. However, definite conclusions cannot be drawn. To the best of our knowledge, no data on the association between comorbidities and TB-related symptoms are available. Diabetes and chronic lung disease are known risk factors for developing and progressing to active TB (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Conditions with underlying chronic lung disease were significantly associated with respiratory symptoms, such as cough/phlegm, dyspnoea, and haemoptysis. Additionally, autoimmune diseases were more related to systemic symptoms, such as fever and weight loss. Patients with chronic heart disease complained more frequently of dyspnoea but lesser weight loss, probably due to fluid overload. Since symptoms related to TB or the underlying disease might be confusing due to their overlapping nature, a multilateral approach considering comorbidities is required when evaluating TB-related symptoms.</p><p>The key strength of our study was the large number of reported TB cases collected systemically across the country, which represented the actual burden of subclinical TB in Korea. Therefore, our study could be a reference for planning government healthcare policies.</p><p>Several limitations should be addressed. First, it remains unclear whether the factors associated with active symptomatic TB are related to delayed diagnosis or triggered awareness of the onset of symptoms. Second, our study population was recruited from PPM-affiliated hospitals and excluding patients from non-PPM hospitals could limit generalization. However, approximately 70% of TB patients were treated under the PPM program. Third, we could not analyse laboratory biomarkers because our prospective nationwide cohort registry did not include these variables. Additionally, though sputum AFB culture positivity in subclinical TB patients could reflect infectivity, actual infectivity in this population might be lower due to the absence of cough. Future well-designed prospective studies should be conducted to monitor the clinical, immunological, and transmission outcomes of these patients and their contacts.</p><p>In conclusion, the development of TB-related symptoms was associated with microbiological burden and clinical characteristics, including underlying comorbidities, which should be evaluated and monitored carefully.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The datasets presented in this article are not readily available because the data that supports the findings of this study are available from the KDCA; however, restrictions apply to the availability of such data, which are not publicly available.
