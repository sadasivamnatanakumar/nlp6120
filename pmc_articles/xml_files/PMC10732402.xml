Specifically, the corresponding author informed PLOS that the underlying ChIP-qPCR expression data reported in <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1010655#pgen-1010655-g008" ext-link-type="uri">Fig 8</ext-link> were inappropriately manipulated.</p><p>The University of California, Davis confirmed that author DPW admitted to manipulation of the data underlying the results presented in <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1010655#pgen-1010655-g008" ext-link-type="uri">Fig 8</ext-link>.</p><p><ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1010655#pgen-1010655-g008" ext-link-type="uri">Fig 8</ext-link> of [<xref rid="pgen.1011095.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] should be considered as unreliable. The authors replicated the experiment reported in this figure by re-growing the same plant materials in a growth chamber under the same conditions, performing ChIP assays at the same developmental stage, and re-analyzing the same regions of the <italic toggle="yes">PPD1</italic> promoter and controls with the same primers as reported in [<xref rid="pgen.1011095.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The authors report that they used an improved ChIP protocol [<xref rid="pgen.1011095.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] for the replicate chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis experiments. The protocol used for the repeat experiments is provided here:</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;Kronos PS plants carrying the <italic toggle="yes">elf3</italic> mutation or a combination of this mutation and the UBI::ELF3-HA transgene were grown to the fourth-leaf stage under SD (8h light). Three grams of above-ground seedling tissue for each replicate were harvested at ZT10 and fixed in formaldehyde. Plants were harvested in the dark prior to fixation to avoid degradation of the ELF3 protein in the light. To aid in fixation penetration, harvested tissue was cut into 2&#x02013;4 mm pieces. Tissue was immediately cross linked under vacuum for 20 minutes in buffer containing 400 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris (pH 8), 1% formaldehyde, then the vacuum was turned off and the tissue sat for an additional 5 minutes. To quench the cross-linking reaction 0.25 M glycine was used and the vacuum re-applied for an additional 5 minutes. Tissue was rinsed with milli-q water three times. After fixation, tissue was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until performing the chromatin immunoprecipitation as described before [95]. After extraction and sonication of chromatin, the samples were diluted to one tenth, and 10% of each sample was saved for input control. The remaining samples were pre-cleaned by rotating with 40 &#x003bc;L Dynabeads protein A (Invitrogen, Carlsbad) for 1 h at 4&#x000b0;C. After pre-cleaning, supernatants without beads were transferred to new tubes and incubated with HA-Tag (C29F4) Rabbit mAB (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. The samples were then applied to freshly prepared Dynabeads protein A (Invitrogen, Carlsbad) and rotated for 2 h at 4&#x000b0;C. The beads were washed with 1x low-salt buffer, 1x high-salt buffer, 1x LiCl buffer and 2x TE. Chromatin elution from the beads and cross-linking reversion were performed as described in [95]. The ChIPed DNA was recovered in 80 &#x003bc;L of nuclease-free water by using PCR purification kit (Qiagen), and analyzed by qPCR using primers listed in Table D in <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010655.s001" ext-link-type="uri">S1 Text</ext-link>.&#x0201d;</p></disp-quote><p><xref rid="pgen.1011095.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref> with this notice reports the results of the replicate experiments.

Since both the -313 to -460 and the -796 to -983 regions overlap with the deletion in the promoter of the <italic toggle="yes">Ppd-A1a</italic> photoperiod insensitive allele, the overall conclusions remain unaffected: the results of the repeat experiments support that ELF3 binds to the <italic toggle="yes">PPD1</italic> promoter and that the deletion of the binding sites in the photoperiod insensitive wheats is the likely cause of the altered expression of <italic toggle="yes">PPD1</italic> and the earlier heading under short days.</p><p>In light of these findings, the second paragraph of the ELF3 binds directly to the <italic toggle="yes">PPD1</italic> promoter <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> subsection of the Results should be disregarded and the third paragraph of this subsection is updated to:</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;We did not observe enrichment of ELF3 for the coding region of <italic toggle="yes">PPD1</italic> between +1514 and +1904 bp or the <italic toggle="yes">FRUITFUL 2 (FUL2)</italic> promoter (-1933 to -1750), which do not have any putative LUX binding sites and were included as negative controls (<xref rid="pgen.1011095.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). The largest and most significant enrichment was detected for the -983 to -796 region in the <italic toggle="yes">PPD1</italic> promoter. We observed a marginally significant enrichment in the other promoter and 5&#x02019; UTR regions that are closer to the coding region, but we cannot rule out the possibility that those were caused by their proximity to the -983 to -796 real binding site, as the chromatin fragment sizes in this ChIP assay could be as large as 1000 bp (<xref rid="pgen.1011095.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). Taken together, these experiments confirm that ELF3 acts as a direct transcriptional repressor of <italic toggle="yes">PPD1 in planta</italic> (<xref rid="pgen.1011095.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>), likely as part of the EC.&#x0201d;</p></disp-quote><p>The second paragraph of the Interactions between <italic toggle="yes">ELF3</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PPD1</italic> subsection of the Discussion is updated to:</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;The ELF3 repression of <italic toggle="yes">PPD1</italic> transcription is likely the result of the binding of the EC to LUX binding sites present in the region deleted in the promoter of the <italic toggle="yes">Ppd-A1a</italic> allele. This is supported by the dawn upregulation of <italic toggle="yes">PPD1</italic> in <italic toggle="yes">lux</italic> mutants in barley [31], diploid wheat <italic toggle="yes">T</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">monococcum</italic> [33, 76], and hexaploid wheat with combined mutations in all three <italic toggle="yes">LUX</italic> homoeologs [32]. LUX is a member of the EC that has a specific DNA-binding domain targeting the GATWCG motif and related promoter elements in Arabidopsis [37, 38, 77, 78]. Therefore, the similar effects of <italic toggle="yes">elf3</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">lux</italic> on the transcriptional regulation of <italic toggle="yes">PPD1</italic> suggests that the EC plays an important role in the repression of <italic toggle="yes">PPD1</italic> during the night and at dawn in the temperate grasses. In Arabidopsis, it has been shown that the EC represses the expression of <italic toggle="yes">PRR7</italic> (a close homoeolog of wheat <italic toggle="yes">PPD1)</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PRR9</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">GIGANTEA</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">LUX</italic> itself [37, 38, 77, 78]. Our ChIP-qPCR results confirmed that ELF3 binds to the <italic toggle="yes">PPD1</italic> promoter within the region that is deleted in the <italic toggle="yes">Ppd-A1a</italic> allele (<xref rid="pgen.1011095.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>), providing a possible explanation for the altered expression of <italic toggle="yes">PPD-A1</italic> in the wheat plants carrying this allele, and for their earlier heading under SD.&#x0201d;</p></disp-quote><p>The PLOS Publication Ethics team reviewed this case in collaboration with the <italic toggle="yes">PLOS Genetics</italic> Editors, and carefully considered case details including the confirmed data manipulation, that the data in question comprise a relatively minor portion of the results, and the reliability of the article&#x02019;s main findings as demonstrated by the repeat data and supported by an Editorial Board member.
