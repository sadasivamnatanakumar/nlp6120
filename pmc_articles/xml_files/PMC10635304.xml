exchange saturation transfer (CEST) effect. ML models are typically trained
using either measured data or fully simulated data. However, training with
measured data often lacks sufficient training data, while training with fully
simulated data may introduce bias due to limited simulations pools. This study
introduces a new platform that combines simulated and measured components to
generate partially synthetic CEST data, and to evaluate its feasibility for
training ML models to predict amide proton transfer (APT) effect. Partially
synthetic CEST signals were created using an inverse summation of APT effects
from simulations and the other components from measurements. Training data were
generated by varying APT simulation parameters and applying scaling factors to
adjust the measured components, achieving a balance between simulation
flexibility and fidelity. First, tissue-mimicking CEST signals along with
ground truth information were created using multiple-pool model simulations to
validate this method. Second, an ML model was trained individually on partially
synthetic data, in vivo data, and fully simulated data, to predict APT effect
in rat brains bearing 9L tumors. Experiments on tissue-mimicking data suggest
that the ML method using the partially synthetic data is accurate in predicting
APT. In vivo experiments suggest that our method provides more accurate and
robust prediction than the training using in vivo data and fully synthetic
data. Partially synthetic CEST data can address the challenges in conventional
ML methods.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes notes-type="arxiv-comment"><p>Updated Supporting Information typos</p></notes></front></article>
