The 13th C1-inhibitor Deficiency and Angioedema Workshop, chaired by Professor Henriette Farkas, was again held in Budapest. Nearly 400 participants from 50 countries from all over the world came to Hungary. Since 1999, when the Workshop was held for the first time, the composition of the registrants has been unique, with active and equal participation in the scientific discussions from allergists, immunologists, dermatologists, otorhinolaryngologists, internists, paediatricians and other specialists, as well as from research biologists, biochemists and pharmaceutical researchers, and representatives of the patient organisations involved in the disease. This year 93 speakers delivered presentations in 10 oral and in 2 poster sessions Professor A. P Kaplan summarised the key findings of this year&#x02019;s conference.</p><p>Written by Dr. Allen P. Kaplan</p><p>Professor of Medicine</p><p>The Medical University of South Carolina</p><p>Charleston, SC, USA.</p><p>Our 3-day meeting reflects tremendous progress being made in the pathogenesis and treatment of all forms of Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) as well as acquired C1-inhibitor Deficiency. We have begun an era of genetic approaches to therapy. Among these are CRISPR knockout of the prekallikrein (PK) gene with excellent preliminary results&#x02014;many participants were attack-free at 16 weeks with a PK reduction of 92%. Adenovirus-dependent insertion of C1 INH into hepatocytes has been achieved with steroid enhancement of both uptake and gene expression as well as reduction of inflammation-related side effects including transaminitis. C1 INH synthesis and secretion into the plasma was achieved; the duration of effect is not yet clear. A supporting lecture on CRISPR methodology explained the need for a guide RNA to localize the site of cleavage and insertion of the gene. Another unique approach with donidalorsen digests PK mRNA, decreases blood levels by 70%, and attack rate by 90%. There are also new therapies employing proteins or peptides. A new monoclonal antibody directed to factor XIIa has excellent efficacy and 56% of study patients were free of attacks. While Berotralstat is quite effective for prophylaxis, even in adolescents, a new oral agent sebetralstat at 3 doses/day can be used for short term prophylaxis e.g. for surgery or dental work. Preliminary data of an oral B-2 receptor antagonist with a deuterium atom incorporated has a long half-life of 10 h., inhibits intravenous bradykinin effects including decreased blood pressure within 15 min. and lasts 8 h. In a phase 2, dose ranging study, HAE attacks were successfully treated. In one STAR 0215 study a modified IgG1 monoclonal antibody to kallikrein has a half-life of 117 days and can be given every 3 months.</p><p>We heard about varying treatment options in different countries. Oral agents are generally favored by patients unless there is a large increase in efficacy with parenteral choices. Quality of life (QOL) increases with use of subcutaneous (SC) C1 INH or Lanadelumab in most studies. But there are issues of drug availability in some countries, costs of therapy, or even appropriate use of the drugs we do have, and then QOL decreases as the therapy varies from what seems to be optimal. In all studies there are patients whose response remains suboptimal, emphasizing that there is still a need for new, better agents. Patient anxiety relates most to the unpredictability of the disease and its chronicity; for some fear of asphyxia and shame are separate issues. Surprisingly it has been shown that there are those who do not carry their &#x0201c;on-demand&#x0201d; therapy with them when traveling, preferring treatment at home, or finding it inconvenient, or just forgetting, that requires attention.</p><p>Many reports dealt with acquired C1-inhibitor Deficiency. While rituximab is frequently employed for associated lymphoproliferative disease, there can be continued angioedema attacks. In one study, employing a new oral, bio available B-2 receptor antagonist given daily, symptoms were controlled for 8 weeks. Anti C1 INH can be present in many antibody classes and an unusually high incidence of erythema marginatum was reported which is more typically seen with hereditary rather than acquired disease. Patients with Monoclonal antibodies of unknown significance (MUGUS) had a 70% incidence of anti C1 INH. Tranexamic acid and lanadelumab were both effective treatment agents and evolution to lymphoma was 4% per patient-year. Absence of anti C1 INH can actually be due to all of it being incorporated into immune complexes, so it&#x02019;s best to measure both free and bound antibody.</p><p>There was also a good representation of basic studies. Dr. Bork spoke to the bypass of factor XII and prekallikrein in HAE with mutated plasminogen or plasmin. The mutated protein directly cleaves kininogens to release bradykinin. Based on the literature it is likely that bradykinin is derived from LK as well as HK and with a 3:1 molar ratio favoring LK, LK may be the major source of bradykinin&#x02014;a first in any HAE disorder. We learned that lactoferrin released from neutrophils is cleaved in the stomach to a smaller very positively charged peptide. It is antifibrinolytic and interferes with plasminogen and urokinase binding to cell receptors. It boosts IFN&#x00264; production and affects T and B cell immunity to viruses including protection against COVID entrance into cells. C1 INH deficiency is associated with procoagulant measurements in plasma such as D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT), and prothrombin fragment 1&#x02009;+&#x02009;2. An increase in venous thrombosis is seen clinically, although the percentage is small. Patients have decreased numbers of NK cells, and the T cells are polarized toward Th2. C3 cleavage products are found indicating that complement activation goes beyond C1, C4, and C2. There is monocyte hyperactivity and increased B2 receptor expression on endothelial cells, but an elevated WBC seems to be due to decreased neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells. Moringa Oleifara seed and extracts from it boosts Hep G 2 cells&#x02019; synthesis of C1 INH. An unusual type II mutation of C1 INH circulates disulfide linked to albumin which may relate to increased antigenic C1 INH seen in some with type II HAE. The vasodilatation due to bradykinin is in part due to modulation of claudin 5 and has no effect the glycocalyx. A positive response to lanadelumab reversed abnormalities of cleaved HK, and plasma levels of C4 and C1 INH. A need for a protease inhibitor cocktail and storage of plasma at -80o C was emphasized when drawing blood for bradykinin quantitation. Then it survives freeze-thawing. All components of the plasma contact activation bradykinin-forming cascade were shown to be activated by aggregated A&#x003b2; of Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease; initiation requires factor XII activation and 25 &#x000b5;M zinc is required. The same abnormalities have, in the past few years, been observed in patients with some suggestion that the extent of activation is proportional to memory loss which suggests a trial of agents that block the bradykinin-forming cascade as therapy.</p><p>Finally there was attention to classification of the many types of angioedema. We learned about assisted diagnosis by artificial intelligence, and there is on-going updating of the International Consensus Document regarding the role of genetics in the diagnosis and management of the many new types of HAE. ACARE centers facilitate education and communication world-wide, and registries for rare disease help collect data regarding patients within individual countries.</p><sec id="Sec1"><title>I-01 Lactoferrin&#x02014;the alarmin which knows when is a time to kill and a time to heal</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Vladimir Leksa</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Institute of Molecular Biology SAS, Bratislava, Slovakia</title><p><italic>Allergy, Asthma &#x00026; Clinical Immunology</italic> 2023, <bold>19</bold>(Suppl 1):I-01</p><p id="Par1">Lactoferrin, a Member of the Lactotransferrin Family of Iron-Binding Glycoproteins, Is Present in Most Human Exocrine Fluids, Particularly Mother Milk. Both Human and Bovine Lactoferrin Exhibit a Plethora of Biological Activities, Including an Iron Sequestration, a Blockade of Proteases, Or a Direct Modulation of Immune Cells. Via These Activities Lactoferrin Plays Manifold Roles in Antimicrobial Host Defense. Furthermore, Antitumor Functions Have Also Been Attributed to Lactoferrin. The Ingested Lactoferrin Is Cleaved Upon Digestion in the Gastrointestinal Tract, Yielding Bioactive Peptides Called Lactoferricins and Lactoferrampins, Which Preserve and Even Augment Some Activities of the Intact Protein. Altogether, These Properties Make Lactoferrin a Cheap and Widely Available Candidate for Supplementary Therapy in Management of Infectious Diseases, Including COVID-19. Here, I Will Focus On the Role of Lactoferrin in Regulation of Pericellular Proteolysis and Discuss Its Possible Implication in Pathogenesis of Hereditary Angioedema.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>I-02 Hereditary Angioedema with the plasminogen gene mutation K330E and other types of Hereditary Angioedema with normal C1-INH</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Konrad Bork</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Department of Dermatology, University Medical Center, Mainz, Germany</title><p><italic>Allergy, Asthma &#x00026; Clinical Immunology</italic> 2023, <bold>19</bold>(Suppl 1):I-02</p><p id="Par2">Types of HAE include classical HAE due to the deficiency of functional C1-inhibitor (HAE-C1-INH), and various new types of HAE with normal activity of C1-INH (HAE with normal C1-INH, HAEnCI, HAE type III). By using next-generation sequencing techniques in more-generation families with patients with HAEnCI, various HAE-linked gene mutations were identified. Currently, 6 types of HAEnCI are recognized, based on underlying mutations of factor XII (HAE-FXII), angiopoietin-1 (HAE-ANGPT1), plasminogen (HAE-PLG, Hereditary Angioedema with the plasminogen gene mutation K330E), kininogen 1 (HAE-KNG1), myoferlin (HAE-MYOF), and heparan sulfate-glucosamine 3-O-sulfotransferase 6 (HAE-HS3ST6). In some of the families with HAEnCI patients, the genetic cause of HAEnCI is still unknown. The detection of the different genetic types of HAEnCI provides a more comprehensive insight into clinical and pathogenetic aspects of HAEnCI. Within the last years, a number of clinical differentiators were identified. They include a high frequency of tongue swellings in HAE-PLG which occur more frequently than in other types of HAEnCI. In some patients tongue swellings were the only type of swelling with no other clinical manifestation. Another differentiator is the higher prevalence of female compared to male mutation carriers in the most common types of HAEnCI. In HAE, less male and more female offspring of mutation carriers than expected for autosomal dominant inheritance inherited the familial mutation. In addition, there were less male offspring than expected in HAEnCI indicating selective effects during early embryonic development. In HAEnCI, the various mutation-induced protein changes may affect the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS), fibrinolytic system and other components of the complex mechanisms leading to angioedema formation. In HAE-PLG, there was a clinical response to a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist as an indirect sign for bradykinin involvement. It was unknown whether the KKS pathway or another mechanism is linking the mutant protein to bradykinin overproduction. A recent study showed that plasminogen can directly release bradykinin from kininogens, and more efficiently if carrying the HAE mutation. In a multi-generation HAE-PLG family an additional F12 mutation, resulting in the loss of one F12 allele was identified. There were no differences in the clinical presentation between HAE-PLG patients with and without the additional F12 mutation. It was concluded that the KKS is bypassed in HAE-PLG.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>I-03 CRISPR opens the way to genetic therapy of angioedema</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Despina Sanoudou<sup>1,2</sup></title><sec id="Sec9"><title><sup>1</sup>4th Department of Internal Medicine, &#x0201c;Attikon Hospital&#x0201d;, Medical School, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece; <sup>2</sup>Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens, Greece</title><p><italic>Allergy, Asthma &#x00026; Clinical Immunology</italic> 2023, <bold>19</bold>(Suppl 1):I-03</p><p id="Par3">The vision of modifying the human genome to cure disease has been pursued since the 1980s. It is only recently however, that the fruits of these efforts started to reach clinical practice and transform patient lives. Among the few gene therapies that have obtained FDA approval are HEMGENIX for the treatment of adults with congenital Factor IX deficiency (Hemophilia B), LUXTURNA for the treatment of adults with retinal dystrophy caused by biallelic RPE65 mutations, ZYNGEGLO for the treatment of adults with beta-thalasemia, and ZOLGENSMA for treatment of children less than 2&#x000a0;years with spinal muscular atrophy caused by biallelic SMN1 mutations. These gene therapy approaches are largely based on reengineered viruses and have been focusing mostly on gene replacement.</p><p id="Par4">The advent of the Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) genome editing technology has given the gene therapy field a major boost forward. CRISPR/Cas9 allows the accurate targeting of almost any desired genomic locus for the purpose of correcting disease-causing mutations or silencing genes associated with disease onset, promising safer and more effective therapies in the near future. Tens of thousands of CRISPR-related articles have been published, and the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to those who developed the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing approach. Importantly, several CRISPR-based clinical trials are ongoing with highly encouraging results to date. Among them, the NTLA-2002 treatment against Hereditary Angioedema that is being developed by Intellia Therapeutics was approved by FDA for a Phase 2 clinical trial.</p><p id="Par5">NTLA-2002 is designed to knock out the target gene kallikrein B1 (KLKB1) in hepatocytes. KLKB1 encodes prekallikrein, a precursor of plasma kallikrein, and therefore its knockout permanently reduces plasma kallikrein activity and halts the production of bradykinin to prevent HAE attacks. Preclinical and early clinical studies performed to date have demonstrated significant and sustained reduction in plasma kallikrein levels, as well as significant reduction or complete elimination of HAE attacks. Kallikrein inhibition is a clinically validated strategy for the preventive treatment of HAE attacks. However, current treatment options often include life-long therapies, which may require chronic intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) administration as often as twice per week, or daily oral administration to ensure constant pathway suppression for disease control. NTLA-2002 is the first single-dose investigational treatment in clinical trials for the potential to continuously reduce kallikrein activity and prevent attacks.</p><p id="Par6">Notably, NTLA-2002 has been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of Hereditary Angioedema (HAE). This paradigm-shifting treatment approach opens the way to a new era of Hereditary Angioedema therapies offering new hope to patients and their families.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>O-01 The Bradykinin cascade is activated in patients with Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease and is activated in vitro by aggregated A&#x003b2; protein</title><sec id="Sec11"><title><underline>Allen P.

Both anticholinergics and the recent monoclonal antibodies to the Plaque constituent A&#x003b2; protein have minimal effect on disease progression. We have demonstrated that while A&#x003b2; monomer is inactive, zinc-dependent aggregation produces a &#x0201c;surface&#x0201d; upon which autoactivation of factor XII can proceed followed by conversion of prekallikrein to kallikrein, and cleavage of HK to produce bradykinin.

While reported in 1999, application of those results to patients has only recently been studied. Factor XIIa levels in blood and CSF elevate progressively as the disease worsens, cleaved HK levels correlate with clinical dementia and neuritic plaque scores, and an antibody to HK prevents its cleavage by A&#x003b2;, while an antibody that blocks binding of prekallikrein and factor XI to HK inhibits intrinsic coagulation induced by A&#x003b2;. Further plasma bradykinin levels in Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease patients are elevated while reduced in CSF but binds to CSF A&#x003b2;40/ A&#x003b2;42 and co-localized with A&#x003b2; plaques in post-mortem brains. While similar findings have been reported in a mouse model of Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease. It is generally assumed that such activation is pathogenic for the disease and that its blockade would be beneficial. We have the drugs needed. Conversely one report of transgenic Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease mouse model found that B2 receptor agonists preserved memory and decreased plaque deposition. Nevertheless it is time to assess possible therapeutic agents for Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease that target individual steps of the intrinsic coagulation, bradykinin-forming cascade.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>O-02 C1-inhibitor deficiency is associated with a procoagulant phenotype in both humans and mice</title><sec id="Sec14"><title><underline>Steven P.

This rare disorder contributes to the reduced quality of life, considerable pain and debilitation and can be potentially fatal. Despite several therapeutic strategies for HAE, it remains a disease with substantial physical and economic burden for patients, with no actual cure and several adverse side effects posed from the current treatment options. The current treatments mainly focus on restoring the C1-INH but not upregulating its production. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to maximise the release of C1-INH by exposing the cells responsible for C1-INH secretion to <italic>Moringa Oleifera</italic> in attempt to upregulate its production and subsequent secretion to the extracellular space.</p><p id="Par25">Initial studies investigated the level of secreted C1-INH by ELISA assay. HepG2 and THP-1 cells were stimulated by the addition to the culture medium of varying amounts of <italic>Moringa Oleifera</italic>. Culture supernatant samples were removed and the level of secreted C1-INH was determined. Crude <italic>Moringa Oleifera</italic> seed was extracted using the solvent extraction method. Cell viability was determined for HepG2 and THP-1 cells before and after treatment using the trypan blue exclusion method and MTT assay. The amount and location of C1-INH in HepG2 in the presence and absence of treatment was observed using florescence imaging. In this study, there was a significant difference observed after treatment with 1000&#x000a0;mg/L of <italic>Moringa Oleifera</italic> on HepG2 cells. There was a significant difference shown for both HepG2 and THP-1 cells per day compared with the control irrespective of the concentrations. MTT data confirmed that the HepG2 has a hepatoprotective role after exposure to <italic>Moringa Oleifera</italic>. Trypan blue exclusion method, showed a significant difference in cell viability for both cell lines after treatment with <italic>Moringa Oleifera</italic> compared with control. Overall, it can be concluded that HepG2 secretes a greater amount of C1-INH and for the first time <italic>Moringa Oleifera</italic> showed the maximum C1-INH secretion with maximum concentrations.</p><p id="Par26">

HAE type I is characterized by low antigenic and low functional C1-INH levels, whereas HAE type II patients have often elevated antigenic, but still low functional C1-INH. A common variant causing HAE type II is the one bearing an R444C mutation (or R466C with precursor numbering). We have purified this variant from plasma of a patient by sequential chromatographic steps, and found that it co-purifies with a 66&#x000a0;kDa protein. On non-reducing gels a&#x02009;~&#x02009;170&#x000a0;kDa band appears suggesting that C1-INH-R444C is covalently bound by disulfide bridging to albumin, which also contains an unpaired Cys residue. The&#x02009;~&#x02009;170&#x000a0;kDa C1-inh-R444C-albumin complex seems to be the predominant variant in this patient, as in early chromatographic fractions, which do not discriminate between mutant and wild-type C1-inhibitor, more than 80% complex was observed. Further characterization and quantification of the variant form is underway. Nevertheless, complex formation with albumin might immediately suggest that the elevated level of antigenic C1-INH in patients carrying this mutation is caused by FcRn receptor mediated recycling.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>O-06 Cell&#x02013;cell contacts and the glycocalyx are relevant structures in bradykinin-mediated endothelial barrier injury</title><sec id="Sec29"><title><underline>Robin Lochbaum</underline>, Angelina Gierke, Nevena Dimitrova, Anna Reich, Caroline&#x000a0;Zimmermann, Thomas K.

This causes an increased formation of the tissue hormone bradykinin, which in turn leads to an increased water flow from the intravascular space into the interstitium. The exact underlying mechanism is not fully understood. However, the barrier function of the endothelium seems to play an important role. This is largely provided by the cell&#x02013;cell contacts tight and adherens junctions, as well as the glycocalyx, a thin carbohydrate layer on the apical side of the endothelium. This project investigates the influence of bradykinin on these structures of the endothelial barrier.</p><p id="Par32"><bold>Material and methods:</bold> We cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) as a commonly accepted endothelial cell model on transwell filters. Bradykinin was added and the changes on endothelial barrier function were investigated. For this purpose, transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and apparented permeability factor were determined, transendothelial water flux was measured using the D2O dilution method. Changes in the expression of genes and proteins of the tight and adherens junctions, as well as the glycocalyx, were examined by RT-PCR, western blot and immunocytochemistry. The thickness of the glycocalyx was determined by wheat germ agglutinin assay. To investigate the role of the glycocalyx on the effect of bradykinin in detail, it was previously enzymatically degraded in one group.</p><p id="Par33"><bold>Results:</bold> Addition of bradykinin resulted in a decrease in TEER and an increase in permeability, consistent with disruption of the endothelial barrier. This was accompanied by increased transendothelial water flow. RT-PCR screening experiments showed modulation of cell&#x02013;cell contact genes, particularly the tight junction protein claudin 5. In contrast, bradykinin itself had no significant effect on glycocalyx thickness in the wheat germ agglutinin assay. However, previous degradation of the glycocalyx resulted in an enhanced effect of bradykinin on the endothelial barrier.</p><p id="Par34"><bold>Discussion:</bold> We demonstrated that bradykinin significantly damages the endothelial barrier. This was accompanied by a decreased expression of the tight junction protein claudin 5, which might explain the observed barrier damage. Furthermore, we demonstrated for the first time that the glycocalyx is protective against bradykinin-mediated barrier damage. This could provide further approaches for the understanding of angioedema.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>O-07 Monocytes hyperactivity and endothelial dysfunction in Hereditary Angioedema: the MONOBRAD study</title><sec id="Sec32"><title><underline>Nicolas Ozanne</underline><sup>1</sup>, Jeremy Bellien<sup>2,3</sup>, Mich&#x000e8;le Iacob<sup>2</sup>, Sylvanie Renet<sup>3</sup>, Sylvain Fraineau<sup>3</sup>, Nicolas Perzo<sup>3</sup>, Guillaume Armengol<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec33"><title><sup>1</sup>Department of Internal Medicine, CHU Rouen, Rouen, France; <sup>2</sup>Department of Pharmacology, CHU Rouen, Rouen, France; <sup>3</sup>University of Rouen Normandie, INSERM EnVI UMR 1096, Rouen, France</title><p><italic>Allergy, Asthma &#x00026; Clinical Immunology</italic> 2023, <bold>19</bold>(Suppl 1):O-07</p><p id="Par35"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Hereditary Angioedema is a genetic disorder resulting in an accumulation of bradykinin causing attacks of angioedema, which can be life-threatening when involving upper airways.

Peripheral and central blood pressure, carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), carotid artery dilatolic diameter, intima-media thickness and distensibility, brachial artery endothelium-dependent flow- mediated dilatation (FMD) and glyceryl trinitrate (GTN)-induced endothelium-independent dilatation were evaluated. Blood samples were collected for determination of plasma proinflammatory cytokines (IL1, IL6 and TNF&#x003b1;) and oxidative stress (TBARs) and monocytes were isolated by a negative immunomagnetic selection for determination of mRNA and protein expression of bradykinin receptors B1 and B2 before and after stimulation with specific agonists of each receptor.</p><p id="Par38"><bold>Results:</bold> Brachial FMD was reduced in patients (mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD: 5.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.2 vs. 7.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.8, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04) without difference in GTN-induced dilatation, blood pressures, PWV, carotid artery parameters and plasma biomarkers.

It is linked to diverse entities, hereditary or acquired, with variable clinical manifestations and associated with different chemical mediators and vascular mechanisms [2]. Numerous classifications and terminologies are currently used, complicating the reporting of clinical studies, research collaborations, accurate diagnosis, and patient care. Recently, novel pathogenetic mechanisms and AE-driving mutations have been described [3], and certain medications in everyday use were also implicated with AE. Therefore, a modernized classification of AE is an unmet need. A new taxonomic system should profile all AE types and subtypes and make them suitable for future personalized medicine. For this purpose, a global initiative was conceived to reach a broad consensus on the definition, acronyms, nomenclature, and classification of AE (DANCE).</p><p id="Par46"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> We performed a focused online literature search for definitions, acronyms, and classifications of AE. A steering committee (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;13) debated and agreed on the updated classification and terminology's aims, rationale, and principles. Consented statements and a vocabulary of acronyms were presented to a large group of international AE experts, all accredited and experienced in allergy, immunology, and dermatology. Voting was performed by an online DELPHI process, in which a consensus was defined by reaching&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;75% agreement [4]. The DANCE initiative is supported and endorsed by several global organizations and professional societies.</p><p id="Par47"><bold>Results:</bold> The global poll included 92 experts from 35 countries. It took five rounds of debates to reach a consensus on the statements and terminology by the steering committee members. The online DELPHI voting process by the global experts required three rounds over 16&#x000a0;months (June 2021 to November 2022). The agreement rate across all 19 statements ranged from 83 to 100%. The new classification comprises five subtypes of AE (namely: mast cell, bradykinin, vascular endothelium, drug-induced and unknown). Proposed endotypes had to combine clinical phenotypes with pathophysiology and recognized genetic mutations. The new proposal also includes a revised list of acronyms covering all AEs.</p><p id="Par48"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The global initiative resulted in an international consensus on the classification and terminology of a wide range of AE entities. The new taxonomy is meant to harmonize and facilitate AE research, accurate diagnosis, and better patient care.</p><p id="Par49">We are indebted to all the international voting experts who shared their suggestions with us and for the excellent secretarial work of Ms. Rebekka Locke, the ACARE coordinator.</p><p id="Par50">

BK1-9 is metabolized by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and other peptidases to generate its metabolites, BK1-8, 1&#x02013;7, 1&#x02013;5, and 2&#x02013;9. Accurate measurement of bradykinin and its major metabolites can significantly improve the clinical assessment of angioedema, from diagnosis to therapeutic response.</p><p id="Par56"><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> An LC&#x02013;MS/MS method for quantification of BK1-9, BK1-8, BK1-7, BK1-5, and BK2-9 concentration was established with LLOQ of 0.1&#x000a0;ng/mL for all analytes. Blood samples were collected prospectively from 36 subjects with or without the diagnosis of HAE were obtained from the Institute for Asthma and Allergy using a clinical study protocol approved by a central IRB. To prevent the ex vivo production of bradykinin 1&#x02013;9 and its metabolites, blood samples were immediately transferred to chilled ethanol or proteinase inhibitor cocktail containing tubes. Non-treated serum and plasma samples were used as controls. The LC&#x02013;MS samples were prepared with techniques of protein precipitation and then solid phase extraction.</p><p id="Par57"><bold>Results:</bold> BK1-5 and BK1-8 were two of the most abundant metabolites and were quantifiable in all 36 subjects. BK1-9 levels are low in normal subjects and in HAE patients although the levels increase considerably during an attack. Both ethanol and proteinase inhibitor treated samples demonstrate dramatically lower levels of detectable bradykinin and its metabolites. Using ethanol or proteinase inhibitors during blood collection are critical to prevent the ex vivo generation of bradykinin. Plasma samples had lower levels of bradykinin than those of serum samples. Importantly, HAE patients on long term prophylaxis have much lower baseline bradykinin levels than patients on acute treatment only. Baseline levels of bradykinin metabolites in many HAE patients who are on long term prophylaxis are close to normal subjects.</p><p id="Par58"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Accurate determination of physiologically relevant levels of BK and its metabolites can be achieved by proper sample handling. The finding of this research offers a better understanding of metabolic profile of bradykinin in HAE patients as well as in healthy subjects, indicating LC&#x02013;MS/MS would be a very useful tool for diagnosis and for monitoring therapeutic response.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec45"><title>O-11 Diagnosis of angioedema by Artificial Intelligence</title><sec id="Sec46"><title><underline>Felix Aulenbacher</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, Henriette Farkas<sup>3</sup>, Kinga Vikt&#x000f3;ria K&#x00151;halmi<sup>3</sup>, Emek Kocat&#x000fc;rk<sup>1,2,4</sup>, Emel Ayg&#x000f6;ren-P&#x000fc;rs&#x000fc;n<sup>5</sup>, Ludovic Martin<sup>6</sup>, Hilary Longhurst<sup>7</sup>, Petra Staubach<sup>8</sup>, Andrea&#x000a0;Zanichelli<sup>9</sup>, Werner Aberer<sup>10</sup>, Anette Bygum<sup>11</sup>, Mignon van den Elzen<sup>12</sup>, Janne&#x000a0;Bj&#x000f6;rkander<sup>13</sup>, Marcus Maurer<sup>1,2</sup>, Markus Magerl<sup>1,2</sup></title><sec id="Sec47"><title><sup>1</sup>Angioedema Center of Reference and Excellence (ACARE), Institute of Allergology, Charit&#x000e9;&#x02014;Universit&#x000e4;tsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universit&#x000e4;t Berlin and Humboldt-Universit&#x000e4;t zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany; <sup>2</sup>Fraunhofer Institute for Translational Medicine and Pharmacology ITMP, Allergology and Immunology, Berlin, Germany; <sup>3</sup>Hungarian Angioedema Center of Reference and Excellence, Department of Internal Medicine and Haematology, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary; <sup>4</sup>Ko&#x000e7; University School of Medicine, Department of Dermatology, Istanbul, Turkey; <sup>5</sup>Angioedema Center, Pediatric Clinic, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany; <sup>6</sup>Department of Dermatology, Angers University Hospital, Angers, France; <sup>7</sup>Department of Immunology, Auckland City Hospital and Department of Medicine, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand; <sup>8</sup>Department of Dermatology, University Medical Center Mainz, Mainz, Germany; <sup>9</sup>Department of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences &#x0201c;Luigi Sacco,&#x0201d; Universit&#x000e0; degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy; <sup>10</sup>Department of Dermatology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria; <sup>11</sup>Clinical Institute, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark; <sup>12</sup>Department of Dermatology/Allergology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands; <sup>13</sup>Wetterh&#x000e4;lsan Outpatient Clinic, J&#x000f6;nk&#x000f6;ping and Futurum, Academy of Health and Care, J&#x000f6;nk&#x000f6;ping, Sweden</title><p><italic>Allergy, Asthma &#x00026; Clinical Immunology</italic> 2023, <bold>19</bold>(Suppl 1):O-11</p><p id="Par59"><bold>Background:</bold> The correct diagnosis of recurrent angioedema (RAE) is a major challenge, mainly because there are no reliable and readily accessible biomarkers for most types. Often, the diagnosis is based on the medical history, clinical presentation, response or non-response to various drugs, in combination with other features such as family history. Here, we used machine learning (ML) to diagnose RAE types and subtypes.</p><p id="Par60"><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> A comprehensive literature search was performed to identify clinical features that are typical or atypical for six different RAE types, e.g. mast cell-mediated RAE/chronic urticaria (RAE-CU), bradykinin-mediated RAE including HAE with and without deficiency of C1-inhibitor, RAE due to acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency, ACE inhibitor-induced RAE, and idiopathic RAE. From this, questions were developed and included in a questionnaire that was distributed to patients treated at angioedema clinics in Angers, Berlin, Budapest, Istanbul, London and Mainz. The information obtained from individual patients (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;342) was matched with the diagnosis established by their treating physician.</p><p id="Par61">An R-script was developed to test various ML-models on patient data using the package &#x0201c;caret&#x0201d;. To enable accurate validation, the patient data were divided into training and test datasets, and the model results were verified through the medical diagnosis. The model with the highest accuracy and Kappa value (random forest&#x02014;RF) was subsequently optimized through hyperparameter tuning to further improve prediction accuracy.</p><p id="Par62"><bold>Results:</bold> Density plots were used to weigh the importance of answers across ten questions asked. The final modified ML RF model demonstrated a high degree of agreement between the disease types diagnosed by physicians and ML. Across the six RAE types, an accuracy of 89.2% and a Kappa value of 81.8% were achieved. A very high sensitivity (96% &#x00026; 100%) and specificity (89% &#x00026; 94%) were obtained for RAE/CU and HAE type 1&#x00026;2, respectively. The sensitivity of ML-based diagnosis was linked to the number of patients per RAE type, i.e. it was lower for types with fewer patients affected.</p><p id="Par63"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Based on the answers of RAE patients to 10 questions, ML succeeded in assigning signature patterns to 6 types of angioedema and diagnosed RAE types with high agreement to the diagnoses made by experts. Optimization by self-learning improved accuracy. Further training of the ML algorithm can be expected to further increase diagnostic accuracy for less frequent types of RAE.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec48"><title>O-12 <italic>SERPING1</italic> splicing-affecting variants highly represented in the Czech cohort of HAE-1/HAE-2 patients</title><sec id="Sec49"><title>Hana Grombirikova<sup>1,2</sup>, Viktor Bily<sup>1,2</sup>, Premysl Soucek<sup>1,2</sup>, Michal Kramarek<sup>1,2</sup>, Roman&#x000a0;Hakl<sup>2,3</sup>, Lucie Ballonova<sup>1,2</sup>, Dita Ricna<sup>1</sup>, Marta Sobotkova<sup>4</sup>, Radana&#x000a0;Zachova<sup>4</sup>, Pavel Kuklinek<sup>2,3</sup>, Pavlina Kralickova<sup>5</sup>, Irena Krcmova<sup>5</sup>, Jana Hanzlikov&#x000e1;<sup>6</sup>, Martina&#x000a0;Vachova<sup>6,7</sup>, Olga Krystufkova<sup>8</sup>, Eva Dankova<sup>9</sup>, Milo&#x00161; Je&#x00161;enak<sup>10</sup>, Ji&#x00159;&#x000ed;&#x000a0;Litzman<sup>2,3</sup>, <underline>Tomas Freiberger</underline><sup>1,2</sup></title><sec id="Sec50"><title><sup>1</sup>Centre for Cardiovascular Surgery and Transplantation, Brno, Czech Republic; <sup>2</sup>Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic; <sup>3</sup>Department of Allergology and Clinical Immunology, St. Anne&#x02019;s University Hospital in Brno, Czech Republic; <sup>4</sup>Department of Immunology, 2<sup>nd</sup> Medical School Charles University and University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic; <sup>5</sup>Institute of Clinical Immunology and Allergy, University Hospital Hradec Kralove, Charles University, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic; <sup>6</sup>Department of Immunology and Allergology, University Hospital Pilsen, Czech Republic; <sup>7</sup>Department of Immunology and Allergology, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Charles University, Czech Republic; <sup>8</sup>Institute of Rheumatology and Department of Rheumatology, 1<sup>st</sup> Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic; <sup>9</sup>Immunia, Prague, Czech Republic; <sup>10</sup>National Centre for Hereditary Angioedema, Department of Pediatrics, Department of Pulmonology and Pathophysiology, Department of Clinical Immunology and Allergology, Comenius University in Bratislava, Jessenius Faculty of Medicine, University Teaching Hospital in Martin, Slovakia</title><p><italic>Allergy, Asthma &#x00026; Clinical Immunology</italic> 2023, <bold>19</bold>(Suppl 1):O-12</p><p id="Par64">In general, splicing-affecting variants are responsible for 15&#x02013;50% of Mendelian disorders. Variants located in the acceptor or donor splice site regions mostly impair pre-mRNA splicing when disturbing directly the conserved dinucleotide sequence AG or GT. The effect of other sequence alterations (e.g. those situated in the polypyrimidine tract, inside exons or deeply in introns) is much more difficult to assess. Multiple factors influence determination of the splice site strength, such as intronic AG-dependence, the quality of polypyrimidine tract or the presence of splicing regulatory elements in the neighbouring sequences. This kind of complex regulation makes the predictions of splicing affection very difficult and testing patient&#x02019;s mRNA expression and/or functional analyses are often necessary to prove suspected variant&#x02019;s pathogenicity.</p><p id="Par65">In the Czech national HAE cohort comprising 88 families, we were able to detect a causal <italic>SERPING1</italic> defect in all but one.

Current approaches to prevent HAE attacks include long-term prophylaxis using agents that chronically inhibit uncontrolled plasma kallikrein generation or continuously replace the missing or dysfunctional C1-INH protein. BioMarin has developed BMN&#x000a0;331, an adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 5 vector containing an expression cassette that encodes for the human C1-INH protein. We are investigating whether a single infusion of BMN 331 can result in expression of functional C1-INH protein and provide long-term correction of C1-INH deficiency.</p><p id="Par69"><bold>Methods:</bold> HAErmony-1 (331-201) is a first-in-human, phase I/II, open-label, dose-escalation study to determine the safety, tolerability, and preliminary short- and long-term efficacy of a single IV infusion of BMN&#x000a0;331 in people with HAE due to C1-INH deficiency (Type I or II). A study schema is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;1. An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will assess safety, oversee study conduct, and provide recommendations on dose-escalation and expansion for each of the planned dose cohorts based on safety evaluations in conjunction with C1-INH functional plasma protein levels and HAE attack occurrences. The study is currently enrolling in the USA, and additional study sites are planned in the EU and Australia.<fig position="anchor" id="Figa"><label>Figure 1 (abstract O-13)</label><caption><p>Study schema</p></caption><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="13223_2023_845_Figa_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par71"><bold>Results:</bold> The first study participant received BMN&#x000a0;331 in April 2022 at Washington University in St. Louis, MO, USA.

Since then, a great progress of special interest for the clinical management of the disease has been made in angioedema genetics. The main discoveries refer to the detection of a lot of new <italic>SERPING1</italic> variants (including deep intronic ones) associated with HAE due to C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency as well as of a series of new genes, variants of which are responsible for HAE with normal C1-INH. These findings necessitated an organized effort towards the evaluation and classification of the pathogenicity of variants in genes responsible for HAE. As a result, a Hereditary Angioedema Variant Curation Expert Panel (HAE VCEP) has been assembled as part of the publicly available Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen), a NIH-funded project. These advances must be considered under the light of the expanding use of genomic technologies and the promising perspectives of gene therapy.</p><p id="Par86">To this end, the same as in 2019 international multidisciplinary group of experts was convened expanded with some new members, with the objective to revise the statements of the 2019 consensus.

The returned comments will be presented and discussed with the participants of the 13th C1-inhibitor Deficiency and Angioedema Workshop in order a revised consensus to be developed using again a modified Delphi survey via voting. The revised statements are expected both to guide clinicians and to serve as a framework for future educational and further genetic testing developments as the field of angioedema genetics continues to evolve rapidly.</p><p id="Par87">

This analysis evaluated attack-free status in patients receiving berotralstat 150&#x000a0;mg in APeX-S, an open-label study assessing the long-term safety (primary objective) and effectiveness (secondary objective) of berotralstat. Patients were stratified by baseline age, gender, and prior prophylaxis. Attack-free days were calculated by subtracting the number of days with angioedema symptoms from the duration of the reporting period of interest for each patient.</p><p id="Par91"><bold>Results:</bold> Overall, 287 patients received berotralstat 150&#x000a0;mg for the study duration. Patients who received berotralstat 150&#x000a0;mg in an open-label fashion remained attack-free a total of 94% of days (100,161/106,926) during the 96-week period. When stratified by baseline characteristics, attack-free status was consistently high regardless of age (12&#x02013;17&#x000a0;years, 97% [7,885/8,166]; 18&#x02013;64&#x000a0;years, 93% [88,184/94,573];&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;65&#x000a0;years, 98% [4,092/4,187]) and gender (female, 94% [60,973/65,169]; male, 94% [39,188/41,757]). Similar results were seen regardless of prior HAE prophylaxis treatment (prior androgens, 92% [52,209/56,611]; prior C1-inhibitor, 92% [31,512/34,425]). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (&#x02265;&#x02009;10% of patients receiving berotralstat 150&#x000a0;mg) were nasopharyngitis (20.6%), diarrhoea (14.6%), upper respiratory tract infection (12.5%), headache (11.8%), and abdominal pain (10.1%), which are consistent with previous reports.</p><p id="Par92"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The percentage of attack-free days remained consistently high with berotralstat monotherapy through 96&#x000a0;weeks, irrespective of baseline characteristics, suggesting a durable treatment effect and sustained reduction in disease burden.</p><p id="Par93">

However, recommended STP treatments require parenteral administration, which presents challenges with preparation, venous access, and injection-site pain. Sebetralstat is an investigational oral plasma kallikrein (PKa) inhibitor for the on-demand treatment of HAE attacks. To support the rationale for the STP regimen in KONFIDENT-S, we report pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and safety data from a phase 1 trial which evaluated 3 doses of sebetralstat every 8&#x000a0;h (q8h) compared with dosing every 2&#x000a0;h (q2h) or 4&#x000a0;h (q4h).</p><p id="Par97"><bold>Methods:</bold> Healthy volunteers were assigned to 3 cohorts with q8h, q4h, or q2h dosing schedules and then randomised to receive 3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;600&#x000a0;mg sebetralstat or placebo while fasting. Venous blood was collected for PK measurements at prespecified intervals following the first and third doses, up to 40&#x000a0;h post-dose. In an exploratory PD analysis, PKa enzyme activity was assayed ex vivo to measure inhibition of exogenously activated enzyme. Safety was assessed. Results were analysed descriptively.</p><p id="Par98"><bold>Results:</bold> The geometric mean C<sub>max</sub> of dose 1 and dose 3 was 3916&#x000a0;ng/mL and 8838&#x000a0;ng/mL, respectively, in the q8h cohort (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6), 4412&#x000a0;ng/mL and 7136&#x000a0;ng/mL, respectively, in the q4h cohort (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6), and 5035&#x000a0;ng/mL and 15,627&#x000a0;ng/mL, respectively, in the q2h cohort (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;18). The lowest arithmetic mean plasma concentrations in the q8h cohort were 758.5&#x000a0;ng/mL at 8&#x000a0;h, 749.8&#x000a0;ng/mL at 28&#x000a0;h, and thereafter; for q4h and q2h schedules, plasma sebetralstat remained&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1000&#x000a0;ng/mL between first and third doses. A geometric mean PKa inhibition of&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;90% was achieved within 30&#x000a0;min of dose 1 (all cohorts). For the q8h cohort, geometric mean PKa inhibition was&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;90% for 6&#x000a0;h, then 84% at 8&#x000a0;h (before dose 2); at 16&#x000a0;h (before dose 3), mean inhibition was&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;90%; after dose 3, mean inhibition was maintained at&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;90% through 24&#x000a0;h, then&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;80% through 28&#x000a0;h. Adverse events were mild and comparable between sebetralstat dosing regimens and placebo.</p><p id="Par99"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Three doses of sebetralstat within 24&#x000a0;h were well tolerated and led to drug accumulation. Geometric mean PKa inhibition of&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;80% was maintained for 28&#x000a0;h when dosing sebetralstat q8h. We designed a 2-year, open-label, phase 3 extension trial (KONFIDENT-S, NCT05505916) which will evaluate the safety of sebetralstat while prospectively evaluating the effectiveness and safety of 600&#x000a0;mg sebetralstat approximately every 6&#x000a0;h in the periprocedural STP setting.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec68"><title>O-17 One-year results from an open-label study of donidalorsen in patients with Hereditary Angioedema</title><sec id="Sec69"><title><underline>Laura Bordone</underline><sup>1</sup>, Kenneth B.

In a randomised phase 2 study (ISIS 721744-CS2, NCT04030598), patients with Type I and II HAE who were treated with donidalorsen reported a 90% reduction in HAE attacks and lower adverse event (AE) rates compared with placebo (71% vs 83%). We report data from the year 1 interim analysis of the open-label extension (OLE) study (ISIS 721744-CS3, NCT04307381) including quality-of-life (QoL), 8-week dosing, and pharmacodynamic data.</p><p id="Par101"><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients who completed the randomised ISIS-721744-CS2 study through Week 17 were eligible for enrolment. The on-treatment period consisted of 2 periods: fixed (Weeks 1&#x02013;13, donidalorsen 80&#x000a0;mg subcutaneously every 4&#x000a0;weeks [Q4W]) and flexible (Weeks 17&#x02013;53) treatment. In the flexible period, patients continued 80&#x000a0;mg Q4W or switched to 80&#x000a0;mg every 8&#x000a0;weeks (Q8W) or 100&#x000a0;mg Q4W. Endpoints included incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), monthly HAE attack rate, Angioedema Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (AE-QoL) score, and effects on plasma prekallikrein (PKK) levels.</p><p id="Par102"><bold>Results:</bold> Seventeen patients with HAE-1/HAE-2 (mean age 39&#x000a0;years) were enrolled. No serious AEs or patient discontinuation due to AEs were reported. Across all groups there was a 94.6% mean (100% median) reduction in HAE attacks, with a mean monthly attack rate of 0.08/month. During the flexible period, 8 patients switched to Q8W; 6 remained attack-free and stayed on this regimen; 2 experienced attacks and returned to Q4W. HAE attack rate decreased by a mean of 75.6% (median of 100%) across all 8 patients in the Q8W dosing group, with a mean monthly attack rate of 0.28. Overall AE-QoL total score improved by a mean of 24 points from baseline to Week 53 of treatment. The mean change in AE-QoL total score from baseline to Week 53 improved by 27 points and 20 points among all patients in the Q8W and Q4W dosing groups, respectively. Improvements were observed in all domains. Overall, mean plasma PKK levels decreased 56.9% from baseline to Week 53 (69.8% median). At Week 53, the mean PKK level in patients using donidalorsen Q8W was 6.0&#x000a0;mg/L higher than that in patients dosed Q4W.</p><p id="Par103"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> No safety signals were identified during the 1-year OLE. Sustained reductions in HAE attack rate and improved QoL were observed. Donidalorsen Q8W also was well tolerated and effective in reducing HAE attack rates. These results confirm prior phase 2 study findings and support continued development.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec71"><title>O-18 The EC<sub>85</sub> derived from the oral bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist PHA121 against bradykinin effects in healthy volunteers predicts the onset and duration of its clinical effects in Hereditary Angioedema</title><sec id="Sec72"><title><underline>Marcus Maurer</underline><sup>1,</sup>*, Anne Lesage<sup>2</sup>, Raf Crabb&#x000e9;<sup>3</sup>, Peng Lu<sup>4</sup>, Kees Groen<sup>5</sup>, Monica&#x000a0;Rodriguez<sup>6</sup>, Jochen Knolle<sup>7</sup>, Hartmut Derendorf<sup>8</sup>&#x02020;, Marc Riedl<sup>9</sup></title><sec id="Sec73"><title><sup>1</sup>Institute of Allergology, Charit&#x000e9;&#x02014;Universit&#x000e4;tsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universit&#x000e4;t Berlin and Humboldt-Universit&#x000e4;t zu Berlin, and Fraunhofer Institute for Translational Medicine and Pharmacology ITMP, Allergology and Immunology, Berlin, Germany; <sup>2</sup>GrayMatters Consulting, Schilde, Belgium; <sup>3</sup>RC Consultancy, Bassins, Switzerland; <sup>4</sup>Pharvaris Inc., Lexington, MA, USA; <sup>5</sup>DGr Pharma, Oudenbosch, The Netherlands; <sup>6</sup>Dynakin, S.L., Derio, Spain; <sup>7</sup>JCK Consult, Frankfurt, Germany; <sup>8</sup>University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA; <sup>9</sup>Division of Rheumatology, Allergy and Immunology, University of California San&#x000a0;Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA</title><sec id="Sec74"><title>*<bold>Correspondence:</bold> marcus.maurer@charite.de</title><p><italic>Allergy, Asthma &#x00026; Clinical Immunology</italic> 2023, <bold>19</bold>(Suppl 1):O-18</p><p id="Par104"><bold>Background:</bold> PHA121 is a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist under development for treatment (PHVS416 softgel capsule formulation) and prevention (PHVS719 extended-release tablet) of Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) attacks.

HAE patients with&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;4 HAE attacks in the prior 12&#x000a0;months and not receiving preventative therapy at the time of screening may enter an 8-week run-in period that will establish baseline HAE attack rate.

Treatments targeting kallikrein, a protease encoded by the <italic>KLKB1</italic> gene, significantly reduce attack frequency and improve patient quality of life. NTLA-2002 is an investigational CRISPR/Cas9-based in vivo gene editing therapy targeting <italic>KLKB1</italic> in the liver, with the goal of achieving lifelong control of HAE attacks after a single dose.</p><p id="Par126"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> A first-in-human, phase 1/2 study of NTLA-2002 in adults with HAE is ongoing, with enrollment complete in the phase 1 dose-escalation portion. The primary endpoint is safety/tolerability; secondary and exploratory endpoints include pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical efficacy. Plasma kallikrein protein was determined by immunoassay; kallikrein activity was determined by plasma kallikrein enzymatic assay. NTLA-2002 pharmacokinetics were characterized by quantifying 2 lipid and 2 RNA components of the drug product by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and quantitative reverse transcription PCR, respectively.</p><p id="Par127"><bold>Results:</bold> Three dose cohorts (25&#x000a0;mg, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3; 50&#x000a0;mg, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4; 75&#x000a0;mg, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3) were enrolled. At the time of this interim analysis, median duration of follow-up was 3.8&#x000a0;months (range, 1.0&#x02013;9.6). Across all dose levels, the most frequent adverse events (AEs) were infusion-related reactions and fatigue. All treatment-emergent AEs were Grade 1 or 2 only. No clinically significant laboratory findings, or treatment-emergent serious AEs, were observed. All patients in the 25&#x000a0;mg and 75&#x000a0;mg cohorts completed the 16-week primary observation period and had an ongoing attack-free interval of 2.3&#x02013;10.6&#x000a0;months, with a mean reduction in monthly attack rate of 89% from weeks 5&#x02013;16 vs baseline. Steady-state plasma kallikrein protein reduction was observed in a dose-dependent manner, with mean reductions from baseline of 65%, 81%, and 92% at the 25&#x000a0;mg, 50&#x000a0;mg, and 75&#x000a0;mg doses, respectively. A similar trend in reduction was observed for kallikrein activity. Interim pharmacokinetic data from the 25&#x000a0;mg and 75&#x000a0;mg cohorts demonstrated that ionizable lipid exhibited a rapid decline from peak levels, followed by a secondary peak, and then a log-linear elimination phase. All lipid components declined below the limit of quantitation after day 15 post-infusion in all patients.</p><p id="Par128"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> A single dose of NTLA-2002 was well-tolerated, and led to rapid, robust, dose-dependent, and durable reductions in total plasma kallikrein protein and activity after transient exposure, with clinically significant reduction in attack rate observed in the cohorts analyzed thus far (25&#x000a0;mg and 75&#x000a0;mg). Additional measures of pharmacodynamic responses and dose&#x02013;response analyses will be presented.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec86"><title>O-22 Prototype of a mobile application to record prodromes and attacks of Hereditary Angioedema</title><sec id="Sec87"><title><underline>Iris Leibovich-Nassi</underline><sup>1,2,*</sup>, Avner Reshef<sup>1</sup>, Erez Shalom<sup>3</sup>, Irina Komarova<sup>1</sup>, Yuval Shahar<sup>3</sup></title><sec id="Sec88"><title><sup>1</sup>Angioedema Research Center, Barzilai University Medical Center, Ashkelon, Israel; <sup>2</sup>Barzilai Academic Nursing School, Ashkelon, Israel; <sup>3</sup>Department of Information Systems Engineering, Ben Gurion University, Beer&#x000a0;Sheva, Israel</title><sec id="Sec89"><title>*<bold>Correspondence:</bold> irisl@bmc.gov.il</title><p><italic>Allergy, Asthma &#x00026; Clinical Immunology</italic> 2023, <bold>19</bold>(Suppl 1):O-22</p><p id="Par129"><bold>Background:</bold> Personal mobile applications (Apps) are already integrated into clinical practice and have become a useful clinical and educational instrument for health management [1]. Recognizing early signs and symptoms preceding Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) attacks (prodromes) may help patients to anticipate impending attacks and prepare for self-treatment that may shorten the attacks [2]. A new instrument (HAE-EPA), based on Patient-reported Outcome Measures (PROMs), has been recently developed to assess prodromes and attacks [3]. The tool has shown its robustness and content validity in evaluating prodromes and their usefulness in predicting attacks. It can alert the patients and help them to deploy therapeutic strategies to preempt the attacks. In the modern digital environment, a personal App on a personal cellular phone can become a handy tool, helping patients evaluate a developing attack in real-time. The App should be able to record early prodromal signs and symptoms, monitor an evolving attack, help make clinical decisions, and transmit data to physicians and disease registries.</p><p id="Par130"><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> We designed, developed, and tested a prototype of a mobile application (iHAE-EPA) capable of storing individual patient reports, analysis of data, and monitoring clinical parameters that assist in managing HAE. The App was developed in a "Flutter" cross-platform technology that operates on Android and Apple iOS operating systems. It resides on a network server, is accessible through an HTTPS protocol, and can code data "parcels" between the clients and the server. Personal and health information are securely protected. Each patient was allotted an ID during the registration, and the data was transmitted to a secure MongoDB database. When signs or symptoms of HAE approached, the users could navigate through the app pages, quickly fill out the questionnaires, connect to their physician, and send the coded data for storage on the server.</p><p id="Par131"><bold>Results:</bold> A group of 10 experienced HAE patients tested the App by sending real-time data to the server and their physician. Patients filled out a utility test rating: connectivity (100%), accessibility (97%), ease-of-use (97%), content visibility (97%), messaging clarity (93%), and general satisfaction from the App (95%). Two HAE expert physicians confirmed that the App helped manage and communicate with patients. Most patients affirmed that the App could help them better manage their disease and enhance communication with physicians.</p><p id="Par132"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We developed a cellular-based disease-specific PROM instrument and tested a prototype, demonstrating its high practicality in managing HAE prodromes and attacks.</p><p id="Par133">

HAErmony-1 (331-201) is the first in-human gene transfer study in Type I/ II HAE patients investigating an AAV5 mediated gene therapy that contains the human <italic>SERPING1</italic> gene (BMN 331) for the prevention of HAE attacks. Several immunomodulation approaches, including corticosteroids, have been utilized in previous AAV gene therapy clinical trials to mitigate the risk of transaminitis. Study 331-201 employs a prophylactic corticosteroid course over 14&#x000a0;weeks. The effect of prophylactic corticosteroid on the <italic>SERPING1</italic> transgene expression is not known. This non-human primate study characterized the expression of human (hC1-INH) derived from BMN 331 in the presence or absence of prophylactic corticosteroid treatment.</p><p id="Par149"><bold>Methods:</bold> A study in female cynomolgus monkeys (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;5/group) evaluated BMN 331 at 6E14 vg/kg in animals with or without prophylactic methylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPS) treatment [prior to injection of BMN 331 and then daily for approximately four weeks (IM injection of 10&#x000a0;mg/kg/day for majority of the period) post-BMN 331 dose]. Cynomolgus and human C1-INH protein levels in plasma were determined using a protein digestion and solid phase extraction (SPE) procedure and analysis by UHPLC-MS/MS. Terminal samples were harvested 12&#x000a0;weeks after BMN 331 dose.</p><p id="Par150"><bold>Results:</bold> Total plasma hC1-INH protein concentrations after administration of 6E14 vg/kg BMN 331 were greater with prophylactic corticosteroids than without by approximately fivefold with no difference in time to peak concentration. Analyses of target liver tissues demonstrated that steroid administration at the time of BMN 331 dosing resulted in increased total vector DNA, accessible vector DNA (as determined by ATAC seq), and expression of transgene RNA. Endogenous cynomolgus C1-INH expression was variable but generally consistent over time, and similar with and without corticosteroid treatment. There was no overt impact on the safety endpoints related to the use of corticosteroids. BMN 331-related changes (with or without corticosteroid treatment) in clinical chemistry parameters were limited to a minimal increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) on Day 3, with values that generally trended toward baseline (Day -1) by Day 15.</p><p id="Par151"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This non-human primate study demonstrated that levels of expression of hC1-INH protein derived from BMN 331 were enhanced in animals receiving prophylactic corticosteroids initiated prior to gene therapy. These nonclinical findings support the clinical study design and employed corticosteroid regimen in HAErmony-1 investigating the safety and efficacy of <italic>SERPING1</italic> gene transfer in HAE patients.</p><p id="Par152"><bold>Ethics Approval:</bold> This protocol and any amendment(s) or procedures involving the care and use of animals in this study were reviewed and approved by Charles River&#x02014;Nevada Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) before conduct.

There is an unmet need for effective prophylactic treatment as there are no therapies licensed for this condition. The bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist icatibant is effective in treating angioedema attacks in this patient population, however, due to its relatively short half-life it is unsuitable for prophylaxis. PHA121 is a selective, orally bioavailable, competitive bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist. In this proof-of-concept study, we aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of prophylactic treatment with PHA121 as softgel capsule formulation (PHVS416) for AAE-C1-INH.</p><p id="Par161"><bold>Methods:</bold> A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, cross-over intervention study was conducted in AAE-C1-INH patients that continued to have angioedema attacks after treatment with rituximab.

HAE nC1-INH can be caused by mutations in different genes: Factor 12 gene (F12), plasminogen gene (PLG), angiopoietin gene (ANGPT1), kininogen 1 (KNG1), myoferlin (MYOF) and heparan sulfate (HS)-glucosamine 3-O-sulfotransferase 6 gene (HS3ST6) [4].</p><p id="Par167">Mutations in F12 gene have been associated with familial angioedema and account for up to 25% patients with nC1-INH-HAE [2]. Point mutation (Thr328Lys or Thr328Arg), a large deletion (deletion of 72 base pairs: c.971_1018&#x02009;+&#x02009;24del72*) or an 18-bp duplication in the F12 (FXII) gene are detected in HAE-FXII [3].</p><p id="Par168">We describe a case series of nine HAE nC1-INH patients and Factor FXII mutation from two different families. All affected patients were women with a mean age at diagnosis of 43&#x000a0;years. Four were asymptomatic, while the others reported recurrent episodes of edema with facial and abdominal location. Trigger factors included medication (contraceptives such as drospirenone 3&#x000a0;mg and ethinyl estradiol 0.03&#x000a0;mg), pregnancy, trauma, and stress. The mean time to diagnosis since the first symptom was three years. Both families had Spanish origin.</p><p id="Par169"><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> Serum, citrated plasma, and EDTA-blood were collected from the patients, and antigenic values of C4 and C1-INH were assayed by turbidimetric immunoassays in serum samples. Functional C1-INH activity was assayed by a chromogenic assay in plasma samples, and genetic testing for F12 was assayed by Sanger sequencing of exon 9 and intron&#x02013;exon boundaries.</p><p id="Par170"><bold>Results:</bold> The results of quantitative and qualitative C4, antigenic and functional C1-INH were normal. Genetic testing for F12 gene revealed that the patients were heterozygous for the common missense mutation c.983C&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;A (p.Thr328Lys).

C1-INH-AAE often accompanies lymphoproliferative underlying diseases, which can be the cause of C1-INH-Ab production. Our aim was to measure C1-INH/C1-INH-Ab complexes (CAC) and investigate their connection to clinical symptoms, C1-INH-Ab and the changes in their titer over time.</p><p id="Par200"><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> In the past 30&#x000a0;years, out of the 3938 patients sent to the Hungaria Angioedema Center of Reference and Excellence with angioedema symptoms. All patients were followed-up and complement parameters were measured frequently.</p><p id="Par201"><bold>Results:</bold> 19 patients were diagnosed with C1-INH-AAE in our Center; 79% of them had an underlying disease. Samples were examined with a newly developed in-house complex ELISA method. Patients with high C1-INH-Ab titer had a CAC titer which did not exceed the normal level and the ones with high CAC titer had a C1-INH-Ab titer which did not exceed the normal level. In case of those patients who had C1-INH-Ab and CAC of the same type of immunoglobulin, the increasing titer of C1-INH-Ab went together with the decreasing level of CAC and vice versa.</p><p id="Par202"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> CAC measurements explained the ineffectiveness of long term profilactic treatment and the need of unusually high dose of acute treatment with C1-INH. Free circulating and complex antibodies are in a dynamically changing equilibrium. CAC measurements can help to predict the development of an underlying disease. The efficiency of the treatment for underlying disease can be monitored by the decreasing CAC titers. Our results show that the CAC can be of important additional information besides the complement panel examination in case of C1-INH-AAE. Measurement of CAC is recommended to be done parallelly with C1-INH-Ab, so as to detect both free and bound antibodies.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec120"><title>O-31 Long-term prophylaxis with Lanadelumab for children and adolescents with HAE</title><sec id="Sec121"><title><underline>Ekaterina A.

Thirty-seven patients, 25 females and 44.23 (range 22&#x02013;75) years old, underwent a total of 43 dental, surgical, or medical procedures. Lanadelumab was used in 25 (54%) and SC pd-C1-INH in 20 (41%) of these patients. A STP was administered in 22 (51%) of the procedures, however 14 patients underwent 21 (49%) procedures without a STP. None of them developed HAE attacks during or after the procedure. The interventions performed without STP were 10 exondontias, 2 endodontias, 2 dental implants, 2 dental fillings, 2 esophagogastroduodenoscopies, one lumpectomy, one hemorrhoidectomy and one inguinal herniorrhaphy.

The evaluation of QoL and specific impact of HAE on life could guide the decisions in the personalized management of HAE.</p><p id="Par216"><bold>Patients and Methods</bold>: By the end of 2022, 126 living patients with HAE were identified in Slovakia. During the period 1.7.2022&#x02013;30.9.2022 we performed the online survey among our HAE patients. We were focused on the disease control, quality of life and the impact on mental health using three standardized questionnaires: AE-QoL (Angioedema Quality of Life Questionnaire), AECT (Angioedema Control Test) and HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale).</p><p id="Par217"><bold>Results</bold>: All together, 68 patients (54% of all HAE patients; 42% females) were included and fulfilled the questionnaires. 45 patients (66.18%) were treated with long-term prophylaxis (18 danazol, 8 berotralstat, 4 tranexamic acid, 13 lanadelumab and 2 pdC1-INH concentrate). 9 patients (13.24%) had asymptomatic disease, 21 (30.88%) mild, 36 (52.94%) moderate and 2 (2.94%) severe form of HAE. 13 patients used a rescue therapy during 4&#x000a0;weeks before the survey. Based on AE-QoL&#x02014;7 patients declared decreased QoL. Females showed better functioning in life compared to males. Patients treated with lanadelumab declared the best functioning compared to the other LTP modalities. Patients without LTP yielded better mood and lower fatigue compared to subjects with LTP. Fear and shame were declared by 12 patients. The disease was well controlled in 61 (89.71%) patients. Patients treated with lanadelumab has the best disease control compared to the other LTP tools. Altogether, 13.24% patients declared anxiety and 8.82% depression of various degree. Although patients with lanadelumab showed the highest level of anxiety, the depression prevalence was low and comparable with the patients without LTP.</p><p id="Par218"><bold>Conclusions</bold>: HAE patients in Slovakia are successfully treated and managed according to the international guidelines. Our HAE patients&#x02019; cohort is well controlled and the disease control is even better compared to the published data from the other countries. HAE affects significantly selected domains of QoL. However, modern tools of LTP&#x02014;especially lanadelumab, could significantly improve various aspects of QoL and prevent the negative impact on mental health of the affected patients.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec130"><title>O-34 Effectiveness of an adapted treatment schedule for long-term prophylaxis in patients with HAE-C1-INH</title><sec id="Sec131"><title><underline>Johana Gil-Serrano</underline><sup>1</sup>, Anna Sala-Cunill<sup>1,2</sup>, Moises Labrador-Horrillo, Paula&#x000a0;Galvan&#x000a0;Blasco<sup>1,2</sup>, Victoria&#x000a0;Cardona<sup>1,2</sup>, Olga Luengo<sup>1,2</sup>, Javier Pereira, Mar&#x000a0;Guilarte<sup>1,2,</sup>*</title><sec id="Sec132"><title><sup>1</sup>Allergy Section, Internal Medicine Department, Hospital Universitari Vall d&#x02019;Hebron, Barcelona, Spain; <sup>2</sup>HAE Spanish Reference Center (CSUR); <sup>3</sup>Allergy Research Unit, Vall d&#x02019;Hebron Research Institute (VHIR), Barcelona, Spain</title><sec id="Sec133"><title>*<bold>Correspondence:</bold> mar.guilarte@vallhebron.cat</title><p><italic>Allergy, Asthma &#x00026; Clinical Immunology</italic> 2023, <bold>19</bold>(Suppl 1):O-34</p><p id="Par219"><bold>Background:</bold> Hereditary Angioedema due to deficient C1-inhibitor (HAE-C1-INH) is a rare disease in which the AE episodes are due to the activation of the contact system and the secondary production of bradykinin. Current prophylactict approach is focused either on the replacement of the C1-inhibitor or interfering in the cascade of the production of the bradykinin. The aim of this study is to describe our experience in a single center with new available prophylactic therapies and the use of a modified regimen treatment with Berinert 2000UI and Lanadelumab in a single hospital.</p><p id="Par220"><bold>Material and methods:</bold> We performed a retrospective study from January 2020 until January 2023 in which we included all patients HAE-C1-INH that were under long-term-prophylaxis treatment with SC pdC1-INH and/or lanadelumab. Demographics, comorbidities, adapted regimen treatment and disease control/quality of life (HAE-QoL, AAS, AECT, AE-QoL) was assessed. Our adapted treatment schedule was: lanadelumab was started at doses of 300&#x000a0;mg every 15&#x000a0;days during 3&#x000a0;months (6 doses), then 300&#x000a0;mg every 3&#x000a0;weeks (2 doses) and finally maintenance dose of 300&#x000a0;mg every 4&#x000a0;weeks and SC pdC1-INH was administered on a fixed dose of 2000UI twice a week (following the GEAB (Spanish Group for the Study of Angioedema Mediated by bradykinin) protocol.</p><p id="Par221"><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 14 patients were under a long term prophylaxis with both SC pdC1NH (57%) or lanadelumab (43%). Eleven patients (79%) were women with a mean age of 41.4 (range 24&#x02013;61&#x000a0;years). Patients with HAE-C1-INH type 1 represent 93% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;13) and HAE-C1-INH type 2 the 7% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1). Those patients receiving SC pdC1-INH, 5 achieved complete disease control with the regimen (4000Ui/week) and in 3 of them required a dose increase (6000Ui/week). Nevertheless, these increase was not enough and a switch to lanadelumab was required. In all patients receiving lanadelumab, a complete control of disease was obtained in 8/9 patients after the first administration. Lanadelumab adapted protocol was possible in all except 1 of the patients.</p><p id="Par222"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The use of an adapted treatment schedule in patients with HAE-C1-INH with lanadelumab and/or Sc pdC1-INH is effective to achieve a complete control of the disease in most of the cases. This can be a useful to minimize hospital visits, treatment costs and to improve patient&#x02019;s quality of life.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec134"><title>O-35 Lanadelumab effectiveness and safety regardless of dosing and dosing changes in patients with Hereditary Angioedema from the United States and Canada: Real-world evidence from the EMPOWER Study</title><sec id="Sec135"><title><underline>Stephen Betschel</underline><sup>1,</sup>*, Paula J.

Guidelines recommend that all patients have sufficient medication for on&#x02010;demand treatment of at least two attacks and carry on&#x02010;demand medication at all times. This survey investigated the frequency with which HAE-C1-INH patients carry their on-demand treatment with them when away from home and the reasons for their decisions.</p><p id="Par230"><bold>Methods:</bold> People living with HAE-C1-INH were recruited by the US Hereditary Angioedema Association (HAEA) to complete a 20-min, self-reported, online survey between September 6 and October 19, 2022.</p><p id="Par231"><bold>Results:</bold> Respondents included 107 people with HAE; 80% female, 98% adults (&#x02265;&#x02009;18&#x000a0;years). Attack management included on-demand therapy only (50%, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;53) or prophylaxis with on-demand therapy (50%, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;54). Only one-third (36%) always carry their on-demand treatment with them when they leave home as part of their day-to-day life, a finding consistent amongst those taking on-demand treatment only (38%) and those on prophylaxis (35%). Overall, patients would travel 3.5&#x000a0;h (mean) from home without on-demand treatment, which included 2.5&#x000a0;h for those on prophylaxis and interestingly, those using on-demand treatment only (not on prophylaxis) would travel even further, 4.5&#x000a0;h, with 21% reporting travel&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;6&#x000a0;h. When asked to provide reasons for not taking on-demand treatment with them, 72%, &#x02018;prefer to administer treatment at home.&#x02019; Other reasons included, &#x02018;on-demand treatment is bulky,&#x02019; (32%), &#x02018;could trigger a security check,&#x02019; (29%), and is &#x02018;embarrassing to carry,&#x02019; (13%). Overall, 44% reported they prefer to avoid potential attack triggers rather than carry on-demand treatment with them. While 77% of patients on prophylaxis state they are confident they will not have an attack and therefore do not carry their on-demand treatment when away from home, 43% also avoid potential attack triggers.</p><p id="Par232"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results highlight that the majority of HAE patients often choose not to carry on-demand treatment with them when they are away from home, missing the opportunity to treat attacks early and optimize treatment outcomes. Given current on-demand treatment options, HAE patients prefer to avoid triggers and treat at home rather than carry on-demand treatment with them. Interestingly, this was also true for patients on modern prophylactic treatment. The promise of self-administered, on-demand therapy, leading to better attack management, has not been fulfilled. New treatment options are necessary to enable better management of attacks and encourage compliance in carrying on-demand treatment when, as part of day-to-day life, patients are away from home.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec142"><title>O-37 The ACARE network&#x02014;An update on global angioedema projects and initiatives</title><sec id="Sec143"><title>Marcus Maurer<sup>1,2</sup>, on behalf of the GA2LEN/HAEi network of Angioedema Centers of Reference and Excellence (ACARE)</title><sec id="Sec144"><title><sup>1</sup>Angioedema Center of Reference and Excellence (ACARE), Institute of Allergology, Charit&#x000e9;&#x02014;Universit&#x000e4;tsmedizin Berlin, corporate member of Freie Universit&#x000e4;t Berlin and Humboldt-Universit&#x000e4;t zu Berlin, Berlin, Germany; <sup>2</sup>Fraunhofer Institute for Translational Medicine and Pharmacology ITMP, Allergology and Immunology, Berlin, Germany</title><p><italic>Allergy, Asthma &#x00026; Clinical Immunology</italic> 2023, <bold>19</bold>(Suppl 1):O-37</p><p id="Par233">The ACARE program is a joint initiative by GA<sup>2</sup>LEN (Global Allergy and Asthma European Network) and HAEi (Hereditary Angioedema International) with the aim of developing and accrediting an interactive network of centers of reference and excellence in angioedema management.

An Italian Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) registry was established in 2015 and formed the embryo for the development, in 2017, of the HAE Global registry (HGR). Unfortunately, the initiative proved to be economically unsustainable and HGR closed in December 2020.</p><p id="Par241"><bold>Objectives and methods:</bold> After the closure of HGR the Italian Network for Hereditary and Acquired Angioedema (ITACA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.angioedemaitaca.org">www.angioedemaitaca.org</ext-link>) decided to take over its original registry and chose as technical partner Burning Flame, which had developed the informatic tool at the beginning. The new project is based on BIF (Business Innovation Framework), Burning Flame&#x02019;s proprietary framework created using PHP, Laravel and Javascript technologies and designed to guarantee high performance and safety standards. The database is hosted on cloud servers managed and monitored by the same IT company.</p><p id="Par242"><bold>Results:</bold> The ITACA HAE registry, active again from February 2023, allows physicians to collect demographics and data on type of angioedema, comorbidities, frequency, characteristics and treatment of acute attacks, Emergency Room admissions, administration of short term prophylaxis, long-term prophylaxis regimen and many other clinical details. Patients can directly enter data on angioedema episodes and periodically fill out questionnaires related to the overall burden of the disease, including AE-Qol, BIS-11, SF-36. To verify the quality of the collected data, patients and authorized staff of the referral centers receive alerts at regular intervals asking them to check whether all clinical events in that period have been entered and verified. Each reference center has access to information on its cohort, and multiple centers can agree to share their data in an anonymized manner for scientific and epidemiological purposes.</p><p id="Par243"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The HAE ITACA registry allows to follow-up patients in real time, even during periods like the one just past when patient access to hospitals and direct contact with referring physicians were severely hampered by the Covid-19 pandemic. The Italian registry gives patients the feeling that they are always in close contact with HAE specialists, as indeed it is, and enables them to have an objective vision of how their situation is progressing over time. Finally, as ITACA owns the software and source code there is the possibility of providing this tool to other countries with quite affordable costs.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec148"><title>O-39 The impact of puberty on C1-INH-HAE course: a survey from the Italian Network for Hereditary and Acquired Angioedema (ITACA)</title><sec id="Sec149"><title><underline>Riccardo Senter</underline><sup>1</sup>, Maria Domenica Guarino<sup>2</sup>, Caterina Colangelo<sup>3</sup>, Marica Giliberti<sup>4</sup>, Luisa Brussino<sup>5</sup>, Donatella Bignardi<sup>6</sup>, Oliviero Rossi<sup>7</sup>, Davide Firinu<sup>8</sup>, Isabella&#x000a0;Del&#x000a0;Corso<sup>9</sup>, Paola Triggianese<sup>10</sup>, Mauro Cancian<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec150"><title><sup>1</sup>Azienda Ospedale, Universit&#x000e0; di Padova, Italy; <sup>2</sup>Presidio Ospedaliero di Civitanova Marche, Italy; <sup>3</sup>Ospedale Spirito Santo di Pescara, Italy; <sup>4</sup>Azienda Ospedaliero, Universitaria di Bari, Italy; <sup>5</sup>Azienda Ospedaliera Ordine Mauriziano di Torino, Italy; <sup>6</sup>IRCCS San Martino, Genova, Italy; <sup>7</sup>AOU Careggi, Firenze, Italy; <sup>8</sup>AUO Cagliari, Italy; <sup>9</sup>AOU Pisana, Italy; <sup>10</sup>Policlinico Tor Vergata, Roma, Italy</title><p><italic>Allergy, Asthma &#x00026; Clinical Immunology</italic> 2023, <bold>19</bold>(Suppl 1):O-39</p><p id="Par244"><bold>Background:</bold> Sex hormones are thought to play a significant role in the pathophysiology of C1-INH-HAE.

In the last decades, the growing expenditure on health has raised concerns about better management of resources destined for this purpose. Among the factors related to the increase in health costs, changes in morbidity and mortality patterns in contemporary societies are evident, which can be explained by the reduction in infectious and contagious diseases and the increase in chronic degenerative ones. Hereditary Angioedema is a chronic disease that requires regular medical follow-up and treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the direct and indirect costs of Hereditary Angioedema with C1-inhibitor deficiency (C1-INH-HAE) treatment in specialized centers in Brazil.</p><p id="Par254"><bold>Methods:</bold> The present study is part of the National Network for Rare Diseases. It has a prospective and retrospective design that aims to understand and measure the Care Value Journey (CVJ) of patients with C1-INH-HAE in Brazil. It was carried out in 116 patients of 7 reference centers. Questionnaires were applied to patients/caregivers, one retrospective and one prospective (v1), containing general data about the patient; diagnosis, treatment, productivity, costs and evolution of the disease. In addition, interviews were conducted with nurses, doctors and administrators allocated in the centers to understand the reality of the resources used within the protocols used for management of C1-INH-HAE in each institution.</p><p id="Par255"><bold>Results:</bold> The most frequently used drug for long-term prophylaxis was oxandrolone [25/116; 21,5%], followed by danazol [14/116; 12.6%] and tranexamic acid [14/116; 12.06%]. The average monthly cost of oxandrolone was US$ 19.94; danazol, US$ 24.05 and tranexamic acid, US$ 8.61. Icatibant Acetate was the most commonly used medication for on demand treatment [14/116; 12.06%], with a mean use of 3 shots every 4&#x000a0;months for each patient. This drug was obtained through lawsuit and the cost per application was US$ 1,416.26. The total cost of this patient's care journey, including medical appointments, exams and medications was US$ 23,391.31 per year. Loss of productivity at work, which is an indirect cost, must also be taken into account in a pharmacoeconomic study. The time spent in a 1-year follow-up of a patient with C1-INH-HAE, taking into account medical appointments and exams, was 372.5&#x000a0;min. This time can reflect on absenteeism at work and school. The assessment of productivity loss, assessed using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment&#x02014;General Health (WPAI-GH) questionnaire, was answered by 7 caregivers and 87 patients. Of these, 46 patients and 4 caregivers answered that they were employed. The percentage of commitment during work (presenteeism) was 32.4% and the absenteeism (time lost from work) was 17.2%.</p><p id="Par256"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The direct and indirect costs that patients with C1-INH-HAE have with the treatment of the disease are excessively high considering the socioeconomic level of Brazilian population. However, the need of better access to therapy is essential. More investments in pharmacoeconomic studies are needed to think of strategies that minimize these costs.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec157"><title>O-42 Management of Hereditary Angioedema with normal C1-INH: About a series of 149 French cases</title><sec id="Sec158"><title><underline>Laurence Bouillet</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, Aur&#x000e9;lie Du Than<sup>2</sup>, Delphine Gobert<sup>2</sup>, Isabelle Boccon-Gibod<sup>2</sup>, Laurent Sailler<sup>2</sup>, St&#x000e9;phane Gayet<sup>2</sup>, Pierre Yves Jeandel<sup>2</sup>, Marie Caroline Taquet<sup>2</sup>, Sophie Debord<sup>2</sup>, Catherine Mansard<sup>2</sup>, David Launay<sup>2</sup></title><sec id="Sec159"><title><sup>1</sup>French National Reference Center for Angioedema, Grenoble University Hospital, Grenoble, France; <sup>2</sup>CREAK, France</title><p><italic>Allergy, Asthma &#x00026; Clinical Immunology</italic> 2023, <bold>19</bold>(Suppl 1):O-42</p><p id="Par257"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Hereditary Angioedema with normal C1-INH (HAE-nC1-INH) are very rare diseases. The diagnosis is genetic. The two most frequent mutations are FXII and PLG. The KNG mutation is rarer. Their management is similar to that of AEH with C1-INH deficiency but without evidence based medicine. CREAK has identified all cases of AEH in order to evaluate their therapeutic management.</p><p id="Par258"><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> This is a national retrospective study conducted in the CREAK network. Any patient identified with an FXII, PLG and KNG mutation was included.</p><p id="Par259"><bold>Results:</bold> 149 patients were included, 27% with the PLG mutation and one case with the KNG mutation. 81,4% were women. The average age of the first symptom is 23&#x000a0;years. In 54% of cases, the pill or pregnancy was the revealing factor. 50% of women who have had a pregnancy have seen their disease worsen. At least one laryngeal crisis occurred in 43% of patients. 39% of women received C1-INH concentrate as attack treatment during pregnancy: the treatment was effective and well tolerated in all of them. 27 patients used icatibant for at least one attack: the treatment was effective and well tolerated in all patients. 35 patients required long-term treatment: 62.5% received tranexamic acid, which was effective in 50% of cases; 7 received lanadelumab, fully effective in 83% of the cases; 1 patient improved with berotralstat. For contraception: 27 women were taking a microprogestin pill; 7 an intra uterin advice.</p><p id="Par260"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This is an important French series. The evaluation of the management shows that treatments targeting the kallikrein kinin pathway (C1-INH concentrate, ictibant) are effective and safe.

There are evidences that increased levels of bradykinin have an important role in the pathophysiology of some of these AE. These ACEi- AE are very severe and life threatening. Spontaneous mast cell angioedema (MC-AE) are like spontaneous urticaria common in the general population and can occur in patients taking an ACEi. MC-AE are not very severe and rarely endanger the vital prognosis. Spontaneous MC-AE and ACEi-AE do not have the same prognosis nor the same impact, i.e. the definitive contraindication of ACEi. Indeed, If ACE inhibitors are not withdrawn, ACEi-AE recurrences tend to increase both in frequency and in severity. Our center has been receiving patients with suspected ACEi-induced BK-AE for several years. Through our national hotline, we ask emergency physicians that any patient suspected of ACEi-AE be re-evaluated by a CREAK specialist. Indeed, a significant proportion of patients labeled as ACEi-AE in the emergency room are in fact spontaneous MC-AE that often become chronic. In this study, we propose to compare ACEi-AE with spontaneous MC- AE initially reported to ACEi and then to propose diagnostic criteria for ACEi-AE.</p><p id="Par262"><bold>Materials, methods:</bold> It is a multicenter retrospective study from 2019 to 2022 conducted in two CREAK centers (Grenoble and Reunion Island). We included every patients addressed for suspicion of ACEi&#x02013;AE with a follow-up of at least 12&#x000a0;months. Diagnostic of spontaneous MC-AE was excluded if AE frequency does not improved with anti-histamines long-term prophylaxis. C1-INH assays have been performed for every patient. In some cases, PLG mutations was also researched.</p><p id="Par263"><bold>Results:</bold> 126 patients were addressed for suspicion of ACEi-AE. Of these, 99 could be included in the study. The diagnosis of ACEi-AE was retained in 49 patients and of spontaneous MC-AE in 50. One acquired C1-INH deficiency and one HAE-PLG were identified.</p><p id="Par264"><bold>ACEi-AE:</bold> The median age of patients at the date of the consultation was 71&#x000a0;years old. 4% have a history of AE before ACEi start. The median time between the start of treatment and the first attack is 1095&#x000a0;days (3&#x000a0;years). The main AE localization were tongue (60.4%) and larynx (18.75%). The median duration of ACEi-AE was 27&#x000a0;h. 85% of ACEi-AE patients went to emergency room for an attack. 23,4% were hospitalized in intensive care unit. Three patients were intubated. One patient died. ACEi was stopped for every patients. Thee patients (6%) have an attack after ACEi disruption. It was a single attack within less than 3&#x000a0;months of ACEi stopping. ACE inhibitors were reintroduced in 2 patients: in both cases, the patients experienced AE again. After 3&#x000a0;months without ACEi, no patients relapsed with a median follow up of 12&#x000a0;months.</p><p id="Par265"><bold>Spontaneous MC-AE:</bold> Patients with MC-AE have a median age of 53,5&#x000a0;years old. 22.5% of them have a history of AE before ACEi start. The ACEi was prescribed since 1267,5&#x000a0;days (3.5&#x000a0;years) when the first attack occurred. Tongue AE occurred in 55% of patients. The median duration of MC-AE was 18&#x000a0;h. ACEi was stopped for every patients and during all the follow up (median duration: 24&#x000a0;months). 30,6% had hives in the same period as AE and 12.24% during the follow up. 47% of patients have had many AE attacks after ACEi disruption. Every patients improved with anti-histamines long-term prophylaxis.</p><p id="Par266"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Based on the characteristics of these angioedema, we can propose diagnostic criteria for AE with IEC.</p><p id="Par267">The main ones are: the absence of angioedema before starting an ACEi, and the absence of relapse after 3&#x000a0;months of stopping the ACEi.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec163"><title>O-44 Autoimmune disorders in C1-INH-Hereditary Angioedema: preliminary data of a prospective study from an&#x000a0;ITACA&#x000a0;cohort</title><sec id="Sec164"><title>Paola Triggianese, Francesco Cellupica, Stella Modica, Elisabetta Greco, Alberto&#x000a0;Bergamini, <underline>Mauro Cancian</underline></title><sec id="Sec165"><title>Department of System Medicine, Tor Vergata University Hospital, Rome, Italy</title><p><italic>Allergy, Asthma &#x00026; Clinical Immunology</italic> 2023, <bold>19</bold>(Suppl 1):O-44</p><p id="Par268"><bold>Background:</bold> In Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) resulting from the deficiency of C1-inhibitor (C1-INH-HAE), the potential inadequate clearance of immune-complexes in the presence of reduced levels of complement components may result in inflammatory damage and release of autoantigens triggering autoimmune responses.

That matter is even bigger in which concern to rare diseases as Hereditary Angioedema. Lack of information, difficult access to treatment and diagnosis delays are proporcional to the burden in patients quality of life.</p><p id="Par284">With that in mind, this study aim to measure the impacts in quality of life of Hereditary Angioedema with C1-inhibitor deficiency (C1-INH-HAE) in specialized treatment centers in Brazil.</p><p id="Par285"><bold>Methods:</bold> The present study is part of the National Network for Rare Diseases project. It has a prospective and retrospective design that aims to understand and measure quality of life of patients/caregivers with C1-INH-HAE in Brazil. It was carried out in 7 reference centers and with 116 patients which 91 of those answered. Two different questionnaires were applied for these patients/caregivers. AE-QoL, where higher scores indicate higher impairment and SF-36, where higher scores indicate better quality of life.</p><p id="Par286"><bold>Results:</bold> Analyzing SF-36, which is divided in 8 domains (Physical functioning, physical role limitations, bodily pain, general health perceptions, energy/vitality, social functioning, emotional role limitations and mental health) the most affected domains were bodily pain (41,26), physical role limitations (42,68) and emotional role functioning (43,95) scored out of 100. General health perceptions had 55,16 out of 100. Physical functioning was the less impaired domain (73,00) The average was 52,20 out of 100. In AE-QoL, which is divided in 4 domains (food, fears/shame, fatigue/mood and functioning) the most affected domain was fears/shame (61,62 out of 100). Food was the less impaired domain (28,24 out of 100) and the average was 42,48 out 100.</p><p id="Par287"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Studying the results, both questionnaires are in agreement since emotional aspects at SF-36 and fears/shame at AE-QoL were the most impaired domains. Thoughts like fear of asphyxia and death or not knowing when the next attack would occur are key reasons to increase the burden of the disease. Added to that, physical questions like severe pain when there is recurrence of crisis also decreased the total average in both questionnaires.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec172"><title>O-47 Real-world effectiveness data on lanadelumab in HAE long term prophylaxis in Slovakia</title><sec id="Sec173"><title>Milo&#x00161; Je&#x00161;enak<sup>1,2,3</sup>, <underline>Anna Bobcakova</underline><sup>2,</sup>*, Katar&#x000ed;na Hrubiskova<sup>4</sup>, Veronika Urdova<sup>2,3,5</sup>, Otilia Petrovicova<sup>1</sup>, Eva Malicherova Jurkova<sup>1</sup>, Branislav Slenker<sup>1</sup>, Peter Banovcin<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec174"><title><sup>1</sup>National Centre for Hereditary Angioedema, Department of Paediatrics, Jessenius Faculty of Medicine in Martin, Comenius University in Bratislava, University Teaching Hospital in Martin, Slovakia; <sup>2</sup>National Centre for Hereditary Angioedema, Department of Pulmonology and Phthisiology, Jessenius Faculty of Medicine in Martin, Comenius University in Bratislava, University Teaching Hospital in Martin, Slovakia; <sup>3</sup>Department of Clinical Immunology and Allergology, University Teaching Hospital in Martin, Slovakia; <sup>4</sup>National Centre for Hereditary Angioedema, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Comenius University in Bratislava, University Teaching Hospital in Bratislava, Slovakia; <sup>5</sup>Department of Internal Medicine, F.D.Roosevelt Teaching Hospital, Banska&#x000a0;Bystrica, Slovakia</title><sec id="Sec175"><title>*<bold>Correspondence:</bold> abobcakova@gmail.com</title><p><italic>Allergy, Asthma &#x00026; Clinical Immunology</italic> 2023, <bold>19</bold>(Suppl 1):O-47</p><p id="Par288"><bold>Background:</bold> The main goal of HAE management is the achievement of full control over the disease activity. In the recent years, an arrival of innovative molecules was noticed in the field of long-term prophylaxis (LTP) for HAE. Among them, lanadelumab (LAN) represents the first monoclonal antibody registered for the HAE. Its efficacy and safety were confirmed by several clinical trials. However, real-world evidence (RWE) data are essential to confirm these results in the daily clinical practice.</p><p id="Par289"><bold>Patients and Methods:</bold> Currently, 126 living patients with HAE were identified in Slovakia (prevalence 1:43 000) and are detailly monitored in the National HAE Registry. LAN was registered in Slovakia in 2021. All the patients with at least 1 HAE attack per months within the last 12&#x000a0;months can be indicated for this therapy. We analysed the clinical effectiveness and tolerability of LAN in the prevention of HAE attacks in a cohort of Slovak HAE patients. We assessed the changes in attacks&#x02019; frequency and their severity and the safety of this therapy.</p><p id="Par290"><bold>Results:</bold> Till January 2023, 17 HAE patients (aged 21.24&#x000a0;years, range 24&#x02013;66&#x000a0;years; 14 females, 82%) are treated with LAN (13.5% of all HAE patients). All these patients fulfilled the indication criteria for LAN. Three treated males were switched from berotralstat due to loss of its efficacy and the rest of the patients were treated with tranexamic acid, attenuated androgens or intravenous C1-INH concentrate. The mean duration of LAN treatment was 11.5&#x000a0;months (range 0&#x02013;19&#x000a0;months). The average number of HAE attacks within the 12&#x000a0;months before the initiation of LAN was 26.06/12&#x000a0;months (range 16&#x02013;47) and during the treatment this number decreased to 1.44 (range 0&#x02013;7). In half of the patients, no attack emerged during the LAN treatment. For the next analysis, we evaluated only 6 patients with the duration of the LAN treatment longer than 12&#x000a0;months. The mean number of HAE attacks decreased from 29.83 (range 22&#x02013;40) to 2 (range 0&#x02013;5) during the 12&#x000a0;months before of during the treatment. We didn&#x02019;t notice any systemic or moderate-to-severe local side effects. All the patients were trained for auto-application at home facilities and their concordance was excellent.</p><p id="Par291"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> RWE data from Slovakia clearly confirm the effectiveness and good tolerability of lanadelumab in the long-term prophylaxis of HAE attacks. This molecule can help to achieve the full control over the disease, even in the most severe symptomatic patients. Lanadelumab presents the breakthrough strategy in the long-term prevention of HAE attacks.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec176"><title>O-48 Understanding the impact of HAE attacks on patient reported quality-of-life&#x02014;analysis of real-world patient data</title><sec id="Sec177"><title><underline>David R.

HAE affects patients&#x02019; activities of daily living and overall health-related quality-of-life (HR-QoL). Real-world research quantifying the effect of HAE attacks on HR-QoL is limited.</p><p id="Par293"><bold>Methods:</bold> Data were drawn from the Adelphi HAE Disease Specific Programme&#x02122;, a real-world point-in-time survey of physicians and HAE patients in the United States. Physicians recorded patient demographics, clinical history, current treatment, and recent attack history for their HAE patients seen between July-November 2021. These patients were invited to provide self-reported data on their attack history and HR-QoL using the Angioedema Quality-of-Life (AE-QoL) tool. In this analysis, AE-QoL results, along with patient characteristics, were described among adult patients with HAE type I or II who had self-reported data stratified based on patient report of any vs. no attacks in the previous month (recall period for AE-QoL).</p><p id="Par294"><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 108 patients in the analysis, 25 (23.1%) reported an attack in the previous month. Demographics of patients who reported or did not report an attack in the previous month were generally similar: 52.0% vs. 45.8% female, mean age 35.2 vs. 30.0&#x000a0;years, mean time since HAE diagnosis 5.6 vs. 4.4&#x000a0;years, respectively. Those who reported an attack in the previous month also experienced more attacks in the last 12-months: mean (SD) attacks in the last 12&#x000a0;months 5.3 (4.7), n&#x02009;=&#x02009;25 vs. 2.3 (1.6), n&#x02009;=&#x02009;83. 96.0% of those reporting an attack in the previous month were on long-term prophylaxis at the time of data collection (i.e., AE-QoL completion) vs. 83.2% not reporting an attack. Patients who reported an attack in the past month had higher mean AE-QoL scores, indicating more adverse impact on HR-QoL, than those who did not report an attack, as measured by total score (mean [SD] 39.8 [16.14] vs. 24.4 [13.36]) and domain scores (functioning, 39.2 [14.27] vs. 19.1 [15.88]; fatigue/mood, 35.8 [18.62] vs. 21.0 [14.24]; fears/shame, 46.1 [20.59] vs. 33.9 [18.50]; nutrition: 35.5 [21.55] vs. 15.1 [13.49]).</p><p id="Par295"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> HAE patients who experienced an attack in the previous month reported worse HR-QoL with the greatest impact regarding fears/shame followed by functional impacts. This suggests that anxiety and fear of experiencing an attack, along with functional impacts, are driving factors in overall HR-QoL for HAE patients on current therapies. Further research is required to understand how attack characteristics affect HR-QoL, along with incorporating these observations into the holistic impact of HAE for patients.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec180"><title>P-01 One-year epidemiologic data from Angioedema Center Vienna, Austria</title><sec id="Sec181"><title>Tamar Kinaciyan</title><sec id="Sec182"><title>Department of Dermatology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria</title><p><italic>Allergy, Asthma &#x00026; Clinical Immunology</italic> 2023, <bold>19</bold>(Suppl 1):P-01</p><p id="Par296"><bold>Background:</bold> In Austria, around 145 people are currently known to suffer from C1-esterase inhibitor deficiency-associated Hereditary Angioedema type I/II (C1-INH-HAE). Moreover, 6 other HAE-types with normal C1-INH values (nC1-INH-HAE) have been identified in recent years. Epidemiological data on these are widely missing yet. While around 450 individuals with F-XII mutation are estimated worldwide, other forms have been identified in 4&#x02013;5 individuals in 1&#x02013;2 families each.

Additional three (3,7%) patients suffered from autoimmune diseases, one had sialadenitis-related unilateral facial swelling, and one patient reported globus sensations due to silent reflux. Another thirty (36%) people suffered from histaminergic angioedema of unknown cause. Among the remaining twenty-six (32%) patients, we identified one patient with C1-INH-HAE type I and an 80-year-old man with decreased C1-INH levels without underlying hematologic disease.

To accurately compare these new therapies, it is pivotal to use uniform outcome measures. Fijen et al. showed there is extensive heterogeneity in outcome measures used to assess efficacy of on demand treatment for HAE [1] leading to a currently ongoing consensus project to create a core outcomes set for studies investigating on demand treatment. In this study, we assessed if a similar variety in primary and secondary efficacy outcome measures is present in randomized controlled trials investigating prophylactic treatment for HAE.</p><p id="Par301"><bold>Methods:</bold> MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central were systematically searched from their commencements until November 2022. Title and abstract and subsequent full report screening was performed by two researchers independently. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. Articles of randomized controlled trials examining patients with HAE due to C1-inhibitor deficiency of all ages that reported at least one outcome parameter and were published in English were included.</p><p id="Par302"><bold>Results:</bold> From a total of 2951 publications, 25 eligible articles were included, reporting results from 22 different studies, including two open label extension (OLE) trials that randomized participants between different doses. All outcomes were extracted verbatim and translated to standardized outcome measures. 80% (16/20) of the non-OLE studies reported the standardized outcome measure <italic>&#x02018;time-normalized angioedema attack frequency&#x02019;</italic> as their primary efficacy outcome. All studies that reported a different primary efficacy endpoint were published before 2003. Still, there were differences observed in the time period used to measure efficacy and the adjudication of angioedema attacks. 75% of the studies measured attack frequency during the complete treatment period, and 25% measured attack frequency during effective dosing period. Angioedema attacks were adjudicated by the patient themselves, the investigator, an expert adjudication panel, and an independent expert, in 43%, 31%, 19%, and 6% of the studies, respectively. There was considerable heterogeneity in secondary endpoints, as there were 43 different standardized outcome measures reported and none of these were reported in all 22 studies.</p><p id="Par303"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This systematic literature review shows that while there is some homogeneity in primary efficacy outcome measures in trials with prophylactic treatment in HAE, these outcome measures are still not completely comparable. Moreover, there is a wide variation in secondary outcome measures. We thus argue that a core outcome set for future trials would enhance comparison between the various prophylactic agents.</p><p id="Par304">

HAE related to C1-esterase inhibitor deficiency (C1-INH) is caused by mutations in the <italic>SERPING1</italic> gene and has an estimated prevalence of 1:50,000 in the general population [2]. Dental procedures can trigger angioedema attacks with critical consequences [3]. The study aimed to assess the frequency of dental procedure-associated angioedema attacks, the type of medications administered to prevent or treat such attacks, and whether the perceived risk of a dental procedure-related angioedema attack may discourage patients from asking and dental professionals from offering appropriate dental care.</p><p id="Par332"><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> The observational study included all the eligible adults from the Romanian Hereditary Angioedema Registry who provided informed consent. The impact of dental procedures on angioedema attacks was measured using a structured questionnaire including 20 questions administered via telephone. Absolute and relative frequencies of the categorical variables, the mean values, and the standard deviations of the numerical variables were computed.</p><p id="Par333"><bold>Results:</bold> The study sample included 94 patients (66% females, 34% males; 88.3% with HAE type I, and 11.7% with HAE type II or III). Patients experienced dental procedure-related symptoms suggestive of HAE both before (47.6%) and after their condition was diagnosed (51.9%). Before the HAE diagnosis, 86.2% of the patients received glucocorticoids and antihistamines for post-procedural swelling. After diagnosis, 85.3% of the patients were given Icatibant and C1-INH. Preventive medication in the case of dental interventions was consistently administered to 8% of the respondents. More than half (55.3%) of the patients reported not demanding dental interventions because of fear of Hereditary Angioedema attacks or anticipation of refusal, and 24.7% of them declared they were denied dental care by dental health professionals at least once.</p><p id="Par334"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Swelling related to dental procedures was common among the studied HAE patient. Unwarranted medications used before HAE diagnosis for dental post-procedural symptoms were replaced by adequate specific medications in most patients with known HAE diagnosis. Few patients benefited from short-term prophylaxis. Many patients avoided dental interventions due to fear of Hereditary Angioedema attacks and some were denied dental care by dental health professionals.</p><p id="Par335">

Activated products of the kallikrein-kinin system might also play a role in the inflammatory processes in COVID-19. The common final pathway in HAE patients with COVID-19 is a plausible additional alteration of vascular permeability. The autonomic nervous system is one of the modulators of the vascular tone that could be investigated by means of the analysis of the Systolic Arterial Pressure (SAP) variability thus providing indices of sympathetic branch of vascular neural control.</p><p id="Par365"><bold>Case description</bold>: a 58 y-old female HAE patient underwent an head-up-tilt-test the day before the onset of fever due to COVID-19 infection (PRE) and one month after the negative nasopharyngeal swab (POST).

One of these factors could be the elevated neutrophil granulocyte (NG) count, which is associated with increased NG activation in C1-INH-HAE patients; however, their origin has not been elucidated so far. Here, we aimed to investigate whether the excess of NGs results from a disturbed maturation, biased circulating/marginated pool equilibrium or decreased elimination.</p><p id="Par381"><bold>Methods:</bold> We enrolled 20 attack-free C1-INH-HAE patients together with 21 healthy controls, and collected blood samples. We compared cell surface maturation markers, adhesion molecules, cytokine receptors, and Ca-mobilization of NG by flow cytometry, activation markers by ELISA and NG/endothelial cell adhesion by automated pipetting system.</p><p id="Par382"><bold>Results:</bold> Cell surface markers showed normal maturation of NGs in C1-INH-HAE patients. Adhesion of NGs to endothelial cells pretreated with lipopolysaccharide or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was significantly weaker in samples from C1-INH-HAE patients, and bradykinin had no effect on the adhesion. NGs from C1-INH-HAE patients were in a more activated state when assessed by soluble activation markers without any stimulation.</p><p id="Par383"><bold>Discussion:</bold> Our data support that the maturation of NGs in C1-INH-HAE patients is normal, whereas adhesion properties are weakly disturbed, indicating a bias between the pool of circulating and marginated NGs. Bradykinin may not be responsible for the disturbed adhesion characteristics.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec224"><title>P-14 Psychodynamic factors impacting the degree of trust in the relationship between a doctor and a HAE patient</title><sec id="Sec225"><title>Ekaterina Shutkova*</title><sec id="Sec226"><title>Department of Clinical Psychology, Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center Of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russian Federation</title><sec id="Sec227"><title>*Correspondence: eshutkova@gmail.com</title><p><italic>Allergy, Asthma &#x00026; Clinical Immunology</italic> 2023, <bold>19</bold>(Suppl 1):P-14 </p><p id="Par384">The HAE diagnosis and a recurrent edema can cause a certain psychological burden.

Many patients, before they get a correct diagnosis, suffer from a misdiagnosis and mistreatment which either has no effect or even has a negative effect on their health (as in case of a surgery on the abdominal edema or the prescription of various diets and antihistamines).</p><p id="Par390">This leads to high dependance on and expectations of doctors and medications, while at the same time many patients have frustrating experiences with healthcare staff and treatment.</p><p id="Par391">The patient&#x02019;s dependance on the doctor (as well as on healthcare officials responsible for the provision of necessary and often expensive medications) creates a breeding ground for the development of a regressive relationship on the part of the patient, the patient perceives a doctor as a parental figure, and himself as a child who needs care and support. That, in turn, results in the developing transference of the patient&#x02019;s internal parent&#x02013;child relationship representations towards the doctor (as well as other staff involved in the treatment). Both negative and positive experiences gained by the patient in the childhood as part the child-parent relationship are involved in the transference, impacting the degree of trust and the establishment of a working alliance between the patient and the healthcare staff. Psychological working through the child-parent relationship representations involved in the transference to the healthcare staff helps to remove the distorted perception of the current experience of the interaction with the healthcare staff and establish a more constructive interaction between the patient and the staff.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec228"><title>P-15 Targeted sequencing panel for the diagnosis of Hereditary Angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency</title><sec id="Sec229"><title><underline>Matija Rijavec</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, Jerneja Debeljak<sup>1</sup>, Nina Rupar<sup>1</sup>, Julij &#x00160;elb<sup>1,3</sup>, Peter Koro&#x00161;ec<sup>1,4</sup></title><sec id="Sec230"><title><sup>1</sup>University Clinic of Respiratory and Allergic Diseases Golnik, Golnik, Slovenia; <sup>2</sup>Biotechnical Faculty, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia; <sup>3</sup>Faculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia; <sup>4</sup>Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia</title><p><italic>Allergy, Asthma &#x00026; Clinical Immunology</italic> 2023, <bold>19</bold>(Suppl 1):P-15</p><p id="Par392">Hereditary Angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency (C1-INH-HAE) is caused by pathogenic variants in the <italic>SERPING1</italic> gene, located on chromosome 11q12-q13.1.

All currently approved HAE on-demand treatments must be administered parenterally, which results in significant treatment burden. The objectives of this qualitative study were to understand patients&#x02019; treated attack experiences and route of administration (ROA) preferences for on-demand treatment.</p><p id="Par397"><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> We interviewed adolescents and adults with type 1/type 2 HAE, recruited through the US HAE Association, who had&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1 HAE attack in the past 6&#x000a0;months and were presently utilizing on-demand treatment with or without long-term prophylaxis (LTP), to characterize their most recent treated attack experiences and assess ROA preferences. To understand trade-offs that participants were willing to make when choosing the ROA, hypothetical self-administered injection and oral on-demand treatments were initially presented with similar efficacy and safety profiles, that were then made better/worse depending upon participants&#x02019; initial treatment choice. Profiles were based on-demand injection treatments&#x02019; US package inserts and clinical trial data for oral on-demand treatment in development.</p><p id="Par398"><bold>Results:</bold> Ten adolescents (mean age 15.5&#x000a0;years, 50% female, 80% on LTP) and 10 adults (mean age 36.7&#x000a0;years, 60% female, 50% on LTP) were interviewed. Adolescents primarily used IV pdC1-INH/rhC1-INH (60%) for their most recent attack and adults used icatibant (80%). Participants&#x02019; most favorable attribute of their on-demand treatment was effectiveness (adolescents: 50%, adults: 80%), while the least favorable attributes, were pain/burning (adolescents: 40%, adults: 30%), delayed response (adolescents: 20%, adults: 30%), and burden of administration (adolescents: 20%, adults: 30%). When presented with hypothetical on-demand treatments with similar efficacy and safety profiles, 100% of participants chose oral over injection treatment. When profiles were varied, most participants (adolescents: 90%, adults: 80%) preferred injection treatment only in a hypothetical scenario where much better efficacy versus oral treatment was demonstrated within the same timeframe. Most adolescents (80%) and adults (70%) changed their preference from oral to injection treatment, only when tolerability/mild side-effects risk was&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;50% with oral treatment.</p><p id="Par399"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> All participants preferred oral over self-administered injection on-demand treatment when efficacy and safety profiles were similar. Most participants (adolescents and adults alike) preferred injection treatment only if it offered much better efficacy, and most changed their preference from oral to injection treatment, only if the oral treatment had substantively worse tolerability and/or safety profile than observed in available clinical studies. Quantitative analyses in a larger cohort are warranted to better refine on-demand treatment preferences.</p><p id="Par400">

In Europe a starting dose of 300&#x000a0;mg every 2&#x000a0;weeks (Q2W) is recommended. If the patient remains attack free with the Q2W dose, the physician can reduce the frequency to once every 4&#x000a0;weeks (Q4W). The study aimed to assess the effectiveness of lanadelumab (attack free rate [AFR]) and dose adjustment in preventing HAE attacks in a real-world setting.</p><p id="Par409"><bold>Methods:</bold> This retrospective cohort chart review study was conducted in Europe (Germany, France, Austria, Greece), in patients&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;12&#x000a0;years old with HAE type I or II who initiated LTP with lanadelumab from 14&#x000a0;November 2017&#x02014;31 October 2021. Data were collected from lanadelumab initiation (index event) to earliest of discontinuation, death, loss to follow-up, or chart abstraction initiation. Patient and treatment history were collected 12&#x000a0;months pre-index. Attacks were documented in the medical chart and/or diary.</p><p id="Par410"><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 198 patients included, mean (SD) age was 43.4 (15.7) years, 61.6% were female, 91.9% had type I HAE and 30.8% had history of life-threatening attacks. In the 12&#x000a0;months before starting lanadelumab (pre-index), 59.6% of patients received LTP, 99.0% used on-demand treatment and 7.5% experienced&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1 life-threatening attack. Most common reason for initiating lanadelumab was lack of/incomplete response to prior HAE prophylactic therapy (41.4%). Median lanadelumab treatment duration was 28.8&#x000a0;months (IQR: 20.4&#x02013;35.7); 96% of patients were still treated at the end of data collection. Increases in intervals of administration from Q2W to any titration occurred in 72.7% of patients. On average, the first increase occurred 8.1 (SD: 6.3) months after index (range 0.54 to 33.64&#x000a0;months). HAE attacks were experienced by all patient&#x02019;s pre-index and 60.6% patient&#x02019;s post-index.

The study objective was to understand the real-world burden of HAE and to obtain HAE patients&#x02019; perspective on their health-related quality of life (HRQoL).</p><p id="Par422"><bold>Methods:</bold> The observational retrospective cohort study was conducted in Europe, Israel and Canada in patients&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;12&#x000a0;years with inadequately controlled HAE type I or II. Patients using lanadelumab as long-term prophylaxis (LTP) were excluded. Medical chart data were abstracted over a 12-month observation period, backward-looking from a qualifying event (QE, the patients&#x02019; last documented HAE attack within the eligibility period). In addition, a one-time cross-sectional patient-reported HRQoL survey was distributed after enrollment. All data were collected between 05 April 2022 and 30 November 2022. Analyses were descriptive.</p><p id="Par423"><bold>Results:</bold> Overall, 214 patients were enrolled from 32 HAE centers in 20 countries. Among patients, 58.9% were females, and had a mean (SD) age of 43 (16) at the QE. The majority (94.4%) of patients were&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;18&#x000a0;years. Most patients (81.8%) had family history of HAE, and had been diagnosed with HAE an average of 16.4&#x000a0;years before the QE. During the 12-month observation period, the average number of attacks was 9.9, attacks lasted 1.9&#x000a0;days on average and mostly affected the extremities (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;153, 71.5%) and abdomen (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;149, 69.6%). Laryngeal/pharyngeal attacks occurred in 22.0% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;47) of patients. Patients&#x02019; attacks were reported as mild (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;137, 64.0%), moderate (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;164, 76.6%), severe (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;97,45.3%) and life-threatening (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;21, 9.8%). Nearly all patients (95.4%) had awareness of their attack trigger factors. Ninety-one (42.5%) patients used LTP, and 185 (86.4%) used on-demand treatment with or without LTP. Five (2.3%) patients needed HAE-specific hospitalization and 47 (21.5%) had an emergency room visit. The angioedema quality of life (AE-QoL) questionnaire was completed by 132 patients&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;18&#x000a0;years to assess patients&#x02019; experiences with angioedema attacks over a 4&#x000a0;week recall period. On a scale of 0 to 100 (higher scores indicating worse QoL), mean (SD) total AE-QoL scores were higher among patients with a higher number of attacks, ranging from 41.1 (23) among patients who reported&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1 attack per month (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;97) to 69.6 (21) among patients who reported&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;3 attacks/month (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;7).</p><p id="Par424"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This burden of illness study shows that patients with uncontrolled HAE experience debilitating mild to severe attacks, and have impaired HRQoL. Novel, effective and safe LTP could be beneficial to further reduce HAE burden and optimize patients&#x02019; HRQoL.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec251"><title>Disclosures:</title><p id="Par425">HF reports receiving research grants from CSL Behring, Shire/Takeda and Pharming and consultancy/speaker fees and honoraria from BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc., CSL Behring, Pharming Group NV, KalVista and Shire HGT/Takeda and serves as an advisor and principal investigator for clinical trials/registries for BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc., CSL Behring, Pharming, KalVista and Shire/Takeda.

These drugs have hepatic metabolism and can cause hepatotoxicity as an adverse effect, and so abdominal ultrasound and blood liver enzymes tests are performed to detect adverse events. We therefore decided to compare the prevalence of NASH in patients with HAE-C1-INH who had previously received LTP with AAs, in comparison to those who had not received them.</p><p id="Par444"><bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective study approved by the Ethics Committee (PI-4598). We included 65 adult patients with confirmed HAE-C1-INH who had at least one abdominal ultrasound with a written report from an echographist available to identify the presence or absence of NASH and had anthropometric data available to calculate their body mass index (BMI). Additionally, we reviewed their clinical history to verify if they had previously received LTP with AAs.</p><p id="Par445"><bold>Results:</bold> Twenty-seven patients (37.5%) had NASH in at least one abdominal ultrasound. Seventy per cent of the patients with NASH had not previously received LTP with AAs, whereas only 48% of those without NASH had not received this therapy (Table 1). X&#x000ba;Additionally patients with NASH presented a higher BMI median in comparison to those without NASH.</p><p id="Par446"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Although there are many other factors that contribute to the development of NASH, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that LTP with attenuated androgens is not a determinant factor that leads to NASH in patients with HAE-C1-INH.</p><p id="Par447">Some limitations of this study are its retrospective design and a possible skew in the prescription of AAs in those patients with NASH, as we considered it a relative contraindication for LTP with attenuated androgens.</p><p id="Par448">

The patient initially experienced abdominal symptoms (recurrent vomiting and abdominal pain) in 2012 and then developed swellings of hands and legs in 2013. Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) type 1 was suspected in 2013. C4 and C1-inhibitor levels were found to be variably low. HAE was confirmed by genetic testing with a disease-causing mutation in the <italic>SERPING1</italic> gene c.536C&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;T, p.Thr179Ile identified in 2014. The patient has never had laryngeal swellings.</p><p id="Par450">The patient developed at least weekly abdominal swellings. Peripheral swellings were infrequent. The family, professionals and clinical psychologists agreed that there was a functional component to the pain and that stress and anxiety worsen the symptoms and can also trigger swellings. School attendance dropped significantly to 25% due to swellings. Various prophylactic interventions were tried, including tranexamic acid (2013&#x02014;ineffective), regular C1-inhibitor infusions (2016 gradual increasing dose, but still poor control and school attendance) and lanadelumab (2020 with initial improvement in school attendance).</p><p id="Par451">Despite lanadelumab swellings continued requiring treatment with on demand C1-inhibitor concentrate, and therefore lanadelumab was stopped. Confidence with the treating team was impacted by the progress and the patient was transitioned to adult services.</p><p id="Par452">At transition the swelling pattern was one to two swellings per week; 70&#x02013;80% abdominal; 20&#x02013;30% predominantly the feet and the hands. The patient recognises the abdominal swellings as being part of HAE rather than an alternative pathology as occasionally there is a rash with the swellings. Treatment response is within two to twenty-four hours dependant on how quickly treatment is used. Response is often quicker for peripheral swellings as they are treated quicker.</p><p id="Par453">The patient completed GCSE examinations and received the required results to progress to college for the preferred course.

The most common form of HAE is caused by the deficiency of the C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) protein. One of the targeted long-term prophylactic treatment options is the substitution of the lacking protein with plasma-derived C1-INH administered subcutaneously twice weekly (sc-pd-C1-INH).</p><p id="Par457"><bold>Objectives:</bold> In our study we aimed to summarise the medical history of four Hungarian patients receiving sc-pd-C1-INH and to assess the effectiveness and safety of the therapy after eight months of follow-up.</p><p id="Par458"><bold>Methods:</bold> Blood and urine tests were taken from all our patients right before the first dose, at one month and at five months of treatment. All four patients filled out an AE-QoL questionnaire right before the first dose and once every month since then. We examined the occurrence of HAE attacks, the number of rescue medications used and the longest attack-free intervals in the eight months before and the eight months since the introduction of therapy. The potential side-effects were also monitored.</p><p id="Par459"><bold>Results:</bold> In our patients (two females (F, aged 33 and 43&#x000a0;years) and two males (M, aged 47 and 61&#x000a0;years)), the complement parameters normalised after the initiation of treatment. None of them experienced any drug-related side effects. In the first month after initiation of treatment, only one patient experienced significant improvement of their quality of life. However, from the second month three out of four patients experienced the same. Two patients (33 y/o F, 47 y/o M), who has had 50 and 23 HAE attacks respectively in the previous 8&#x000a0;months, did not experience any HAE attacks since the introduction of sc-pd-C1-INH. The number of HAE attacks in the other two patients (43 y/o F, 61 y/o M) was reduced to one-fifth during the treatment period (10 instead of 50 and 7 instead of 35, respectively). The two symptom-free patients did not need any rescue medication, while the other two patients needed one-fifth of the previous amount (23 instead of 130 and 8 instead of 39).

PHA121 is a potent and selective bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist under development for on-demand and prophylactic treatment of HAE.</p><p id="Par463"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> RAPIDe-1 was a phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over, dose-ranging trial of PHVS416, oral softgel capsule formulation of PHA121, for treatment of attacks in HAE due to C1INH deficiency. The Mean Symptom Complex Severity (MSCS) score is a measure of attacks&#x02019; symptom severity incorporating the body sites affected and patient-reported symptom severity at each site. The Treatment Outcome Score (TOS) assesses patient-reported response to therapy based on body sites, baseline severity, and response post-treatment dosing. Change in MSCS [minimally important difference (MID): &#x02212;&#x000a0;0.30] score from pre-treatment to 4&#x000a0;h (h) post-treatment and TOS (MID: 30) at 4&#x000a0;h post-treatment were secondary endpoints of RAPIDe-1 trial.</p><p id="Par464"><bold>Results:</bold> Seventy-four participants were enrolled and 62 of them treated 147 qualifying HAE attacks with study drug (PHVS416 10, 20, 30&#x000a0;mg or placebo) at the time of the primary analysis. MSCS (score decreased) and TOS (score increased) improved during the first 4&#x000a0;h after administration of PHVS416 (all 3 doses) whereas they did not significantly change in placebo-treated attacks. At 4&#x000a0;h, the least squares mean differences of change in MSCS and TOS scores in PHVS416 (10, 20, 30&#x000a0;mg)- and placebo-treated attacks were &#x02212;&#x000a0;0.79 (nominal p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001), &#x02212;&#x000a0;0.61 (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0008), and &#x02212;&#x000a0;0.39 (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0291) and 64.13 (nominal p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001), 62.69 (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001), and 71.06 (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001), respectively. Estimated median time for patients to achieve improvement (&#x0201c;a little better&#x0201d;) for all body sites involved by the attacks at 2 consecutive time points on TOS was 1.89, 2.15, and 1.98&#x000a0;h for PHVS416-treated attacks vs. 7.62&#x000a0;h for placebo-treated attacks. Median time to achieve a status of &#x0201c;a lot better or resolved&#x0201d; at all body sites involved was 4.02, 5.93, and 4.12&#x000a0;h for attacks treated with the 3 doses of PHVS416 vs. 23.28&#x000a0;h for placebo-treated attacks.</p><p id="Par465"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In RAPIDe-1 placebo-controlled trial, treatment with PHVS416 led to more rapid symptom relief and resolution of HAE attacks assessed through the MSCS and TOS, consistently with the outcomes of primary and other secondary endpoints measured through the VAS-3.</p><p>

The study was approved by the Ethics Committee (PI-4598). Demographic and clinical data were collected. HRQoL was assessed with HAE-QoL and disease activity with HAE-AS. The first (T1) and last (T2) questionnaires available for each patient were selected, separated by at least 1&#x000a0;year.</p><p id="Par468"><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 76 patients were included, predominantly female (56.6%). The median age at T1 was 41.5&#x000a0;years (P25&#x02013;75: 35.0&#x02013;55.0) and at T2 46.5&#x000a0;years (P25&#x02013;75: 39.0&#x02013;59.75).</p><p id="Par469">The number of patients that used Long-term prophylaxis (LTP) between T1 and T2 increased (38,2% versus 43.4%). In T1 6.6% used tranexamic acid, 25% attenuated androgens and 6.6% IV plasma derived C1-INH (IV pdC1-INH). In T2 new treatments were available, only 1.3% used tranexamic acid, 21.1% attenuated androgens, 2.6% IV plasma derived C1-INH (IV pdC1-INH), 10% SC pdC1-INH, 6.6% Lanadelumab and 1.3% Berotralstat.</p><p id="Par470">18.4% of the patients started or stopped LTP between T1 and T2. 31.6% changed type of LTP between T1 and T2. 21.1% of the patients had begun to use the new available treatments at T2.</p><p id="Par471">The rescue treatments used in the last 6&#x000a0;months before T1 and T2 were the following: in T1 40.8% used icatibant acetate, 18.4% IV pdC1-INH, 11.8% both and 28.9% none. In T2 51.3% used icatibant acetate, 10.5% IV pdC1-INH, 5.3% both and 32.9% none.</p><p id="Par472">The median total HAE-QoL score was 102.5 (P25&#x02013;75: 84.0&#x02013;120) and HAE-AS score was 6 (P25&#x02013;75: 3.25&#x02013;8) at T1. The median total HAE-QoL score was 109 (P25&#x02013;75: 89.25&#x02013;125) and HAE-AS score was 5.5 (P25&#x02013;75:3&#x02013;8) at T2.</p><p id="Par473">HRQoL (HAE-QoL) improved significantly in T2 compared to T1 (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.028).

Recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor (rhC1-INH; Ruconest) is approved in multiple countries for the on-demand (acute) treatment of HAE attacks. An ongoing treatment registry for multiple European countries has been examining the efficacy and safety of rhC1-INH.</p><p id="Par484"><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients with C1-INH-HAE were enrolled following a decision to treat with rhC1-INH and acquisition of written informed consent. Medical history and baseline HAE information were obtained at screening. Treatment decisions were at the discretion of the health care providers (HCPs) involved in the patients&#x02019; care, according to the HCPs&#x02019; standards for the management of C1-INH-HAE, and in line with the approved rhC1-INH summary of product characteristics. Using a web-based questionnaire, HCPs entered data on HAE attacks, response to therapy, and adverse events (AEs) following treatment.</p><p id="Par485"><bold>Results:</bold> From 01 July 2011 through 01 January 2023, 92 patients with C1-INH-HAE (37 male/55 female; current mean age, 51&#x000a0;years; current age range, 18&#x02013;82&#x000a0;years) in 9 countries reported 3599 HAE attacks and were treated with rhC1-INH within the registry. The mean age at HAE diagnosis was 27&#x000a0;years (range, 3&#x02013;78&#x000a0;years). Before registry enrolment, patients, including 26 (28.3%) who were on maintenance therapy/prophylaxis at registry enrolment, experienced a mean of 30 HAE attacks the previous year. Since enrolment there have been 1544 (42.9%) abdominal, 1294 (36.0%) peripheral, 498 (13.8%) oro-facial-pharyngeal, 229 (6.4%) urogenital, and 181 (5.0%) laryngeal HAE attacks; of these, 133 attacks involved 2 locations and 7 involved 3 locations. The mean rhC1-INH dose was 3417 U (43.8 U/kg). Patients reported resolution of 97.8% of HAE attacks (3520/3599) with rhC1-INH within 4&#x000a0;h; most HAE attacks (99.8%; 3593/3599) required only 1 dose of rhC1-INH. Six HAE attacks were treated with a second dose (total rhC1-INH administered to treat attack, 4200 U). No hypersensitivity or thrombotic/thromboembolic events or drug-related serious AEs were reported.</p><p id="Par486"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This rhC1-INH treatment registry continues to provide real-world data on the on-demand (acute) treatment of HAE attacks and supports the efficacy and safety of rhC1-INH across multiple HAE attack locations in individuals with C1-INH-HAE.</p><p id="Par487">

Much rarer than HAE are angioedemas caused by increased consumption of C1-INH, e.g. in the context of lymphatic or autoimmune diseases, called acquired C1-INH-deficiency (C1-INH-AAE). There is currently no approved treatment for C1-INH-AAE, so off-label treatment is based on HAE therapy.</p><p id="Par510">We present the successful off-label use of C1-INH s.c. for long-term prophylaxis (LTP) in a patient with C1-INH-AAE.</p><p id="Par511"><bold>Methods:</bold> The frequency and localisation of attacks were recorded using the attack diary for 6&#x000a0;months during on-demand therapy (ODT) with Icatibant 30&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;s.c. (M0), as well as 1 and 6&#x000a0;months (M1, M6) after initiation of LTP with C1-INH s.c.. In addition, treatment control and quality of life were assessed using the validated questionnaires AECT and AE-QoL at M0, M1 and M6.</p><p id="Par512"><bold>Results:</bold> A 68-year-old female patient suffered from recurrent swellings since 2014. Blood tests showed decreased C1-INH concentration and activity and C1q. The initial diagnosis of C1-INH-AEE was made in 2015 and a mutation in the <italic>SERPING1</italic> gene was excluded. Repeated (haemato-)oncological investigations showed no abnormalities. Since 2014, an ODT with Icatibant 30&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;s.c. was established. In 2021, the attack frequency had increased significantly to 5 attacks/month. The patient showed a highly impaired quality of life (AE-QoL 98.53) and low therapy control (AECT 2), so LTP was indicated. Because of concomitant medication with tricyclic antidepressants, therapy with C1-INH 3000&#x000a0;IU&#x000a0;s.c. twice a week was initiated. In the following 6&#x000a0;months (M6) only 2 attacks occured. At M1 AECT showed complete disease control (16) and AE-QoL showed an improved quality of life (61.7). Due to a therapy break after M6, the number of attacks increased, AE-QoL of 85.29 and AECT of 8 worsened, so LTP was resumed.</p><p id="Par513"><bold>Discussion:</bold> This case clearly shows that even in the off-label setting of C1-INH-AAE, treatment with C1-INH-LTP can effectively reduce the attack frequency and achieve good disease control and improve quality of life.

For patients with Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) as well as the population, this preventive action is essential. However, due to a lack of knowledge about the risks and benefits of immunization, outdated vaccination may occur. With that in mind, the <bold>aim</bold> of this study was to evaluate the vaccination coverage of HAE patients and their fears.</p><p id="Par520"><bold>Methods:</bold> patients with confirmed HAE diagnosis followed in our outpatient clinic responded to a questionnaire which included clinical characteristics of the disease and registry of vaccines received.</p><p id="Par521"><bold>Results:</bold> the data were collected from 25 patients, aged between 15 and 68&#x000a0;years; 88% [22/25] were female and 12% [3/25] were male; 60% [15/25] of HAE type 1 and 40% [10/25] of HAE with normal C1-INH. Vaccination coverage was defined according to the complete immunization recommendations of the SBIm (Brazilian Society of Immunizations) and compared with official Brazilian registry (BR). The vaccine coverage was against: BCG [12/24; 50% vs BR 52%]; Inactivated Poliovirus [14/25; 56% vs BR 51%]; Oral poliovirus [11/25; 44% vs BR 51%]; Diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus [13/25; 52% vs BR 39%]; Meningococcus ACWY [1/25; 4% vs BR 22%]; Meningococcus B [2/25; 8% vs BR 47%, approximately]; Meningococcus C [2/25; 8% vs BR 53%]. As for pneumococcal vaccine, the coverage against PCV10, PCV13, and PPSV23 was 0% for complete immunization [vs BR 89%, approximately]. In addition, the vaccine coverage against measles, mumps, rubella was [7/25; 28% vs BR 57%], HPV [3/25; 12% vs BR 35%], hepatitis B [16/25; 64% vs BR 55%]; no one received hepatitis A [vs BR 52%] and Covid-19 was the most prominent coverage [20/25; 80% vs BR 50%]. Anxiety during vaccination was reported by 8% [2/25].</p><p id="Par522"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> For patients in this study, fear of vaccination was not a major obstacle to immunize. Although vaccination against hepatitis A and B is recommended by all guidelines, there was no coverage for hepatitis A and 1/3 of the patient did not receive the vaccine for hepatitis B. The coverage of HAE population is comparable to the Brazilian population, reflecting the restricted access to vaccines not offered by public helath system. Higher compliance to COVID-19 vaccination probably reflected in the inclusion of HAE as an immunodeficiency.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec290"><title>P-34 C1-INH complexes as markers for classical and lectin pathway activation and complex levels in angioedema patients</title><sec id="Sec291"><title><underline>Lisa Hurler</underline><sup>1</sup>, Erika Kajd&#x000e1;csi<sup>1</sup>, Erik J.M.

HAE classified into HAE with C1-inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency and HAE with normal C1-inhibitor (HAE-nC1-INH) that has six different genotypes recognized. Cutis laxa syndromes are a group of heterogeneous disorders clinically characterized by loose, redundant skin folds. Excessive skin folds are a consequence of dermal elastic fiber fragmentation, the histological hallmark of cutis laxa. Congenital cutis laxa results from monogenic defects that impair elastic fiber assembly while acquired cutis laxa results from proneness to elastic fiber degradation.</p><p id="Par532"><bold>Case Report:</bold> We describe a patient from Brazil, female, 57&#x000a0;years old. In June 2015, she noticed progressive sagging of the skin on the chest, abdomen and especially the face, with excessive wrinkling. After 2&#x000a0;months, she developed facial angioedema after Zika virus infection and after 1&#x000a0;year, she started to present hives associated with skin swellings with poor improvement with H1-antihistamines treatment. In 2017, she had a facial plastic surgery to improve her sagging skin, but without efficacy. The following year, she was diagnosed with cutis laxa and chronic spontaneous urticaria after skin biopsy, but even at fourfold doses of H1 antihistamines there was no improvement. In 2020, she started the treatment with omalizumab with resolution of the hives but no change in frequency of angioedema which affected mostly the face. Thus, after 6&#x000a0;months, the omalizumab administration interval was reduced from four to two weeks, but the treatment was discontinued due to the still recurrent facial swelling. In 2021, whole-exome sequencing was performed which identified a rare heterozygous missense variant (p.Thr200Ala) in exon 6 of the plasminogen gene (PLG). The presence of this variant was confirmed by Sanger sequencing and was also detected in her two asymptomatic sons and her twin sister, who have been affected with less frequent attacks of swelling, but did not have urticaria or clinical findings of cutis laxa. The patient was treated with tranexamic acid with no response and started with lanadelumab treatment for long-term prophylaxis and icatibant for acute attacks with a better outcome.</p><p id="Par533"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Through the clinical history of the patient and evidence in the literature regarding HAE-nC1-INH, we believe that this variant in PLG could lead to clinical angioedema phenotype found. Probably the association of HAE with cutis laxa might explain the recurrent attacks of swelling.</p><p id="Par534">All patients gave explicit permission for their information to be published.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec299"><title>P-37 Development of HAE awareness in the Czech Republic</title><sec id="Sec300"><title><underline>Camelia Isaic</underline><sup>1,*</sup>, Ane&#x0017e;ka Da&#x00161;kov&#x000e1;<sup>2</sup></title><sec id="Sec301"><title><sup>1</sup>HAE Junior patient organization, Czech Republic; <sup>2</sup>First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic</title><sec id="Sec302"><title>*<bold>Corresppondence:</bold> cisaic@haejunior.cz</title><p><italic>Allergy, Asthma &#x00026; Clinical Immunology</italic> 2023, <bold>19</bold>(Suppl 1):P-37</p><p id="Par535"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Low levels of rare disease awareness can lead to diagnosis delay, misdiagnosis and/or negatively impact the quality of everyday life of patients living with such diseases.

In patients with HAE with nC1-INH 6 pathogenic variants have been identified in factor XII (HAE-FXII), angiopoietin-1 (HAE-ANGPT1), plasminogen (HAE-PLG), kininogen 1 (HAE-KNG1), myoferlin (HAE-MYOF), and heparan sulfate-glucosamine 3-O-sulfotransferase 6 (HAE-HS3ST6) [2]. Approximately 30% of these cases are due to factor XII pathogenic variants. Point mutation (Thr328Lys or Thr328Arg), a large deletion (deletion of 72 base pairs: c.971_1018&#x02009;+&#x02009;24del72*) or an 18-bp duplication in the factor XII gene are detected in HAE-FXII [3].</p><p id="Par546"><bold>Case report:</bold> A 47&#x000a0;years old woman, started with edema from the age of 20 on the lips, eyelids and the all face lasting 3&#x000a0;days, in addition to laryngeal edema at least 1 per year treated with steroids and antihistaminic with mild improvement. The attacks increase after the placement of a contraceptive subdermal implant. In September 2020, she presented laryngeal attack, cardiorespiratory arrest that required advanced resuscitation maneuvers and ventilatory assistance for 72&#x000a0;h.

Recurrent episodes of edema often represent life-threatening states. Currently, a number of drugs to combat attacks are widely available. The most urgent question for a treating physician is a choice of a drug from the available range, taking into account mechanism of action, route of administration and other parameters.</p><p id="Par560"><bold>Method:</bold> The objective of this retrospective study was to assess the equivalence and safety of Icatibant and C1-INH concentrate in treatment of HAE attacks. The inclusion criteria were the age of patients 0&#x02013;18&#x000a0;years, the confirmed HAE diagnosis, at least one attack during the study period, administration a study drug within 24&#x000a0;h of the onset of the first symptoms of edema. The study includes 34 patients (33 with C1-INH deficiency and one patient with its functional defect). The age at inclusion in the study varied from 3 to 17&#x000a0;years (Me&#x02014;12&#x000a0;years). The observation time was 1 to 5&#x000a0;years (Me 3.5&#x000a0;years). Patients were given Icatibant subcutaneously or C1-INH concentrate intravenously.</p><p id="Par561"><bold>Results:</bold> All 34 patients (16 children and 18 juveniles) received Icatibant treatment, 27 patients (14 children and 13 juveniles) received C1-INH concentrate. A total of 302 episodes of attacks were analyzed, of which 225 (74.5%) were treated with Icatibant, 77 (25.5%)&#x02014;with C1-INH concentrate. The edema reduction after 30&#x000a0;min of a drug administration was equivalent for both drugs.

Both conditions have similar clinical manifestations, but onset of symptoms is later in C1-INH-AAE, and there is no family history of angioedema and facial edema is more frequent in C1-INH-AAE [1].</p><p id="Par579">We present the case of a 72-year-old male patient who complained of recurrent acute abdominal pain associated with vomiting. A CT scan revealed mesenteric panniculitis, which was treated with multiple antibiotics. The patient also experienced an episode of tongue edema without wheals, refractory to treatment with corticoids and antihistamines. He had no relevant medical history or regular medication, and no family history of angioedema. Bradykinin-mediated angioedema was suspected and lab test was performed.</p><p id="Par580"><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> Serum, citrated plasma, and EDTA-blood were collected from the patient, and lab tests confirmed Acquired Angioedema (C1-INH 8,88&#x000a0;mg/dl, Functional C1-INH 40% (154%).

Treatment focuses on symptom control with therapies that regulate bradykinin activity and treatment of any underlying conditions. Rituximab has been used successfully to treat C1-INH-AAE [3]. This case highlights the importance of addressing the underlying cause of Acquired Angioedema, as it can significantly improve the patient's quality of life and prevent future attacks.

C1-inhibitor concentrate is considered the preferred drug for precautionary reasons and it is used both on-demand and, if appropriate, in a prophylactic regimen [3]. Although few case reports of thrombosis ascribed to C1-inhibitor concentrate were published [4], this medication is not commonly considered a prothrombotic factor in clinical practice.</p><p id="Par592"><bold>Case report:</bold> A 30&#x000a0;years old female with an established diagnosis of type 1 HAE had a dramatic increase of frequency and intensity of attacks after discovering being pregnant.</p><p id="Par593">Prophylaxis with intravenous C1-inhibitor was initiated: 1000 units twice/week were administered for two months, later escalated to three times/week due to recrudescence of attacks.</p><p id="Par594">When pregnancy arrived to full-term the patient underwent a caesarian section, few hours after the last administration of C1-inhibitor.

On the other side, it is uncommon that HAE presents itself with chronic abdominal disorders in clinical practice, even if sub-continuous abdominal attacks could theoretically result in this clinical scenario. New effective treatments have been approved in the last years and have made possible to manage very complicated cases, also when apparently refractory.</p><p id="Par608"><bold>Case report:</bold> A 14-years old female patient, with no family history of angioedema, presented with acute abdomen to the emergency room in November 2018. The clinical history was also significant for intermittent abdominal pain and sporadic cutaneous and/or sub-cutaneous angioedema without urticaria. A CT scan revealed extensive peritoneal fluid collection and the patient underwent explorative laparoscopy, where a tubaric cyst was removed. After gynecologic consultation she was discharged with estro-progestinic medications. Her following years were characterized by sub-continuous abdominal pain, severe stypsis with laxative-dependence and nervous anorexia, which was treated for several months in a specialized structure as an inpatient. At the age of 17 an episode of subcutaneous angioedema, involving hands, finally prompted to the assessment of C1-inhibitor and C4, and a diagnosis of type 1 HAE was made. After the withhold of estrogens, stypsis and chronic abdominal pain receded, but abdominal attacks were still frequent and poorly controlled by on-demand treatment with both Icatibant and/or intravenous C1-inhibitor concentrate (at dose of 20 units/kg). Therefore, subcutaneous treatment with Lanadelumab 300&#x000a0;mg every 14&#x000a0;days was initiated, but not effective. The prophylactic therapy was changed to intravenous C1-inhibitor concentrate twice a week, without achieving an adequate control of attacks. Moreover, the patient started to have very poor venous accesses. The correctness of the diagnosis was questioned; however, an abdominal ultrasound, performed during acute attack, supported the diagnosis showing free peritoneal fluid, that disappeared after symptoms improvement. Subcutaneous C1-inhibitor was then implemented, with excellent results.</p><p id="Par609"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The abdominal involvement in HAE is often recognized by the response to on-demand therapy. When abdominal attacks show a sub-continuous course and appear refractory to the treatment, the diagnosis of HAE could be questioned; in this setting abdominal ultrasound can help. All available treatments must be considered when patients show a refractory or atypical presentation.</p><p id="Par610">All patients (or their guardians) gave explicit permission for their information to be published.</p><p id="Par611">

The genetic form is a rare autosomal dominant disorder due to C1-inhibitor deficiency (type I) or dysfunction (type II).</p><p id="Par614">In patients with C1-INH-AE, the inadequate control of the contact system causes excessive bradykinin formation with localized and transient increase in vascular permeability, resulting in angioedema attacks. Eliciting factors of the attacks include trauma, emotional factors, medical procedures and infections. Certain studies suggest that mRNA vaccines potentially represent an eliciting factors of angioedema attacks. However, only few data were reported about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in patients with C1-INH-AE.</p><p id="Par615"><bold>Method:</bold> In this study we collected the data about a population of 208 adult patients with C1-INH-AE (107 females) followed by 11 reference centers in Italy (Milan, Florence, Padua, Turin, Civitanova Marche, Salerno, Naples, Aosta, Ancona, Genoa, Messina). Of those, the majority of patients (89%) had a diagnosis of hereditary C1-INH-AE and 23 patients were diagnosed as acquired C1-INH-AE. In this cohort the mean attack rate was 0.89/months. Long term prophylaxis (LTP) was prescribed in 80 patients with hereditary C1-INH-AE and in 9 patients with acquired C1-INH-AE. The primary aim of this observational study was to collect data on the onset of acute attacks in the 72&#x000a0;h following the COVID-19 vaccination.</p><p id="Par616"><bold>Results:</bold> Between December 2021 and June 2022, 203 patients with C1-INH-AE received Covid 19 vaccines in a controlled medical setting in reference centers. Four hundred and five doses were administered as a part of primary vaccination cycle and 124 doses were given as booster doses. The majority of patients received mRNA vaccines. About 5% of patients received vaccines made using adenovirus vector; in particular ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines (Astra-Zeneca) and Ad26.COV.2.S (Jassen/Johnson &#x00026; Johnson). A total of 48 attacks of angioedema occurred within 72&#x000a0;h after the vaccine administration were registered. The majority of them (50%) were abdominal attacks; extremities were involved in 20% and 39% of cases respectively after primary vaccination cycle and booster doses; combined (cutaneous and abdominal) attacks were occurred respectively in 20% and 11% cases. Three patient reported a laringeal attacks after the administration of first dose of Pfizer (in two cases) and of second dose (in one case). However, no hospitalization was required. In all cases, the attacks were successfully treated with icatibant or plasma derived C1-inhibitor. Interestingly, there is no difference in the rate of attacks occurred after vaccines between patients on LTP regimen and those using on demand treatment.</p><p id="Par617"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our data suggest that Covid 19 vaccines are safe and tolerable in patients with C1-INH-AE. These patients could be vaccinated with these novel vaccines in a controlled medical setting.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec335"><title>P-48 Garadacimab for Hereditary Angioedema prophylaxis in adolescents: efficacy and safety from the VANGUARD Phase 3 and 3b open-label extension trial (first interim analysis)</title><sec id="Sec336"><title><underline>Markus Magerl</underline><sup>1,</sup>*, Inmaculada Martinez-Saguer<sup>2</sup>, Joshua S.

Here, adolescent safety and efficacy data from the pivotal Phase 3 study and open-label extension (OLE, first planned analysis) (NCT04739059) are reported for the first time.</p><p id="Par619"><bold>Methods:</bold> In the pivotal Phase 3 study, after&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1-month run-in, six adolescents (aged 12&#x02013;&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;17&#x000a0;years, HAE type I/II) were randomised (3:2) to receive once-monthly subcutaneous garadacimab 200&#x000a0;mg (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4) or placebo (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2), respectively, for 6&#x000a0;months after initial garadacimab 400&#x000a0;mg loading dose or volume-matched placebo. All six adolescents from the pivotal Phase 3 study and five additional garadacimab-na&#x000ef;ve adolescents entered OLE at same dose regimen (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10; one aged 18&#x000a0;years in OLE was analysed thereafter as an adult). Time-normalised monthly attack rate during treatment period was compared against run-in.</p><p id="Par620"><bold>Results:</bold> At OLE first planned analysis, garadacimab exposure ranged from 3.3&#x02013;15.2&#x000a0;months (inclusive of pivotal Phase 3 study). No serious treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), TEAEs leading to discontinuation, TEAEs of special interest (abnormal bleeding events, thromboembolic events, severe hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis), treatment-related TEAEs, or injection-site reactions were reported in either pivotal Phase 3 or OLE studies. In the pivotal Phase 3 study, 4/6 adolescents (66.7%; 2 treated, 2 placebo) experienced&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1 TEAE (11 TEAEs reported; all were mild [10/11, 90.9%] or moderate [1/11, 9.1%]). In OLE, 6/10 adolescents (60.0%) experienced&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1 TEAE (20 TEAEs reported; all were mild [16/20, 80.0%] or moderate [4/20, 20.0%]).</p><p id="Par621">In the pivotal Phase 3 study, 2/4 garadacimab-treated adolescents (50.0%) were attack-free for the entire 6-month treatment period and 1 adolescent (25.0%) achieved 92.3% attack rate reduction vs run-in; subsequently, all three maintained or achieved attack-free status in OLE. One garadacimab-treated adolescent who initially experienced a 5.8% increase in attack rate vs run-in during the pivotal Phase 3 study, achieved a 45.5% reduction vs run-in in OLE and has been attack-free since July 2022. All 5 garadacimab-na&#x000ef;ve adolescents in OLE were responders: 3 adolescents were attack-free (range of exposure 3.3&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;12.5&#x000a0;months), one achieved 93.8% reduction over 15.2&#x000a0;months and one achieved 65.7% reduction over 3.3&#x000a0;months vs run-in.</p><p id="Par622"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Consistent with adult data from the pivotal Phase 3 study and OLE, once-monthly garadacimab demonstrated a favourable safety profile and had sustained efficacy as routine prophylaxis to prevent HAE attacks in adolescents.</p><p id="Par623">

C1-INH protein provides negative control over kallikrein&#x02013;kinin system (KKS). Although the inheritance of the C1-INH-HAE is autosomal dominant, female predominance has often been observed in patients with HAE [3, 4]. However, there is a paucity of literature on transmission discordance between male and female offspring in patients with HAE.</p><p id="Par627"><bold>Methods:</bold> Pedigree charts of 41 families with a confirmed diagnosis of HAE-C1-INH and a pathogenic variant in the <italic>SERPING1</italic> gene were analysed. Patients with HAE who had had at least one child were included for analyses to assess the risk of transmission from the father or mother to their offspring.</p><p id="Par628">Results: Overall, 49.1% (172/350) of all offspring inherited the genetic defect. In the subgroup analyses, 53.9% (82/152) female offspring and 45.4% (90/198) male offspring inherited the genetic defect. This difference was not statistically significant. Fathers with <italic>SERPING1</italic> gene mutation had a statistically significant skewed transmission favouring wild allele to male offspring (41.8%, 41/98; p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.02). There was no statistically significant difference when a father transmitted the mutation to a female offspring or a female transmitted the mutation to either male or female offspring (Table 1).</p><p id="Par629">

Many cases of HAE are missed or mistreated in resource-limited settings. With availability of single immunologist, there is paradigm shift in diagnosis and management of recurrent angioedema in Nepal. We describe the profile of patients with HAE at a tertiary care centre from Nepal.</p><p id="Par638"><bold>Methods:</bold> Case records of patients diagnosed as HAE at the tertiary private care centre in Kathmandu during Aug 2021-January 2023 were analysed.

Five are type 1 HAE with low C4 and C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH). One patient had normal C1-INH. Median age of onset of symptoms and diagnosis were 7.5 and 17 years, respectively. Two patients had pathogenic <italic>SERPING1</italic> gene mutation. One patient with normal C1-INH was found to have kininogen (KNG1) mutation. Report of genetic analysis of two patients are pending. Remaining could not perform tests due to financial constraints and unavailability of genetic tests in country.
