Specifically, the corresponding author informed PLOS that the underlying qRT-PCR expression data reported in this study were inappropriately manipulated.</p><p>The University of California, Davis confirmed that author DPW admitted to manipulation of the data underlying the results presented in the originally published Fig 5 (see <xref rid="pgen.1011097.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>).</p><p>The authors replicated the qRT-PCR experiments presented in <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008812#pgen-1008812-g005" ext-link-type="uri">Fig 5</ext-link> by regrowing the same plant materials in growth chambers under the same long-day (LD) and short-day (SD) photoperiods and temperature conditions. The RNA was extracted at the same developmental stage as the original study, and the expression profiles of the genes were re-analysed by quantitative RT-PCR using the same primers. The original raw data for the repeat experiments are in <xref rid="pgen.1011097.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref> of this notice.</p><p>The authors state that the major conclusions reported in the original study remain unaffected, but that the replicate experiments highlighted some differences in the results reported in the originally published Fig 5 (see <xref rid="pgen.1011097.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>) and corresponding Results sections.
