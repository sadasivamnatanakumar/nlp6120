SARS-CoV-2 virions, or its spike protein, produced after COVID-19 vaccination, bind to platelets via ACE2 receptor, leading to activation of platelets and the secretion of platelet factor 4 (PF4).

Both Streptokinase and APSAC modify in vitro platelet aggregation by two mechanisms; reduced aggregation due to fibrinogenolysis, and enhanced aggregation via an immunological reaction. The reduced aggregation by SK (or APSAC) is mediated by plasmin generation and the fibrinogen degradation product, fragment E. As shown in this figure, SK (or APSAC) may also trigger platelet aggregation by a mechanism involving specific IgG anti-SK. Both SK- (or APSAC) induced platelet aggregation and SK- (or APSAC) enhanced ADP-induced platelet aggregation require the interaction of the Fc domain of the anti-SK antibodies with the platelet Fc&#x003b3;RIIA.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fcvm-10-1342177-i002" position="float"/></fig><p>The authors apologize for these errors and state that this does not change the scientific conclusions of the article in any way.
