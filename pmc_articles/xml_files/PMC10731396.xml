In view of the fact that certain of these data had already apparently been published previously, the Editor of <italic>Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine</italic> has decided that this paper should be retracted from the Journal. The authors were asked for an explanation to account for these concerns, but the Editorial Office did not receive a reply. The Editor apologizes to the readership for any inconvenience caused.</p></body></article>
