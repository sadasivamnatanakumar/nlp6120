</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Problems to reproduce the <italic>A. correntinus</italic> results</title><p id="Par8">In addition, we found a crucial mistake in the calculation of 1B/0B coverage ratios in Sup_dataset_<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>, as size difference in the 0B and 1B libraries were not normalized. The 1B library (505,608,854 reads) was 30.37% larger than the 0B one (387,817,038 reads), so that, if all the reads were used in the mappings (and it was not specified to have used the same number of reads from both libraries), the 1B sequences had a starting advantage to reach the 1.5 minimum coverage ratio expected (which is based on assuming that the number of copies was equal for A and B chromosomes, so that a library with 1B would carry 50% more copies than a 0B one). Therefore, library size difference, alone, already implied 1.3 departure coverage ratios (in favour of the 1B library) and this could determine that many contigs reached the 1.5 coverage ratio, by chance, thus being false positives.</p><p id="Par9">To test this possibility, we performed mappings of genomic DNA (gDNA) on two sets of reference transcripts, since the source for the gene annotation is unclear. We extracted 61 contigs from the database of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and 26 contigs downloaded from the database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (see our Supplementary text note <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>), with two different approaches. We first performed the mappings using the same software used in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] (Bowtie2), as indicated in our Supplementary text note <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref> (mapping results are shown in our Supplementary_file_<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). For comparison, we also performed mappings with the SSAHA2 software, with the options we usually apply to map genomic reads on a transcriptome reference (see our Supplementary text note <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">6</xref> and Supplementary_file_<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The results of our mappings, expressed as &#x0201c;reads mapped&#x0201d;, and without normalizing for library size differences (as it was apparently done in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]), revealed that out of the 61 EBI contigs annotated as protein-coding genes in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], all of which showed 1B/0B&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1.5 in its Sup_dataset_3, only 41 actually passed the 1.5 threshold using Bowtie2 and 48 passed it with SSAHA2 mappings (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>; see the &#x0201c;61contigs_notrim&#x0201d; sheet in our Supplementary_file_<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Therefore, even trying to follow paper&#x02019;s indications (with the difficulties mentioned above), only 67% of the 61 EBI contigs supposedly residing on the B chromosome (according to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]) actually passed the 1.5 threshold using Bowtie2 (79% using SSAHA2). Most importantly, when we normalized for library size, this figure decreased to 44% (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and the &#x0201c;61contigs_notrim_norm&#x0201d; sheet in our Supplementary_file_<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), indicating that almost half of the 61 contigs annotated as protein-coding genes in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] were false positives due to the unequal size of the 0B and 1B libraries.</p><p id="Par10">

Likewise, after expressing coverage ratio as number of copies per haploid genome, thus implying normalization for library and genome size, the results were highly similar to those mentioned above for read mapping calculations with normalization (or using the same number of reads from both libraries) (see our Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Supplementary_files <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>), with 48% (Bowtie2) and 44% (SSAHA2) reproducibility in the case of the 61 EBI contigs, and only 8% and 12% reproducibility, respectively, for the 26 NCBI contigs.
