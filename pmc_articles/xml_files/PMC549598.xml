<article-title>SARS Transmission Pattern in Singapore Reassessed by Viral Sequence Variation Analysis</article-title>
</related-article></article-meta></front><body><p>To quickly control infectious disease outbreaks, extensive information is required to identify the source and transmission routes, and to evaluate the effect of containment policies. Traditionally, scientists have used travel- and contact-tracing methods, but the recent SARS epidemic showed that sequence-based techniques for pathogen detection can also be important tools to help understand outbreaks. Jianjun Liu and colleagues adapted mass spectrometry (MS)&#x02013;based genotyping, already used as a high-throughput way of detecting single nucleotide polymorphisms in human DNA, to the analysis of the SARS virus from clinical samples.</p><p>The major breakthroughs against SARS were the discovery of the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as the etiological agent and the sequencing of the SARS genome. Liu's colleagues at the Genome Institute of Singapore had previously shown that common genetic variants in the SARS-CoV genome could be used as molecular fingerprints to help trace the route of infection. However, as &#x0201c;sequence analysis of large numbers of clinical samples is challenging, cumbersome, and expensive,&#x0201d; they felt that &#x0201c;what is needed is a rapid, sensitive, high throughput, and cost-effective screening method.&#x0201d; Towards this goal, Liu and colleagues now demonstrate that an MS-based technique can quickly yield accurate information on clinical isolates (in this case from the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore).<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0020052-g001"/>

They analyzed isolates taken from 13 patients with SARS at different stages of the Singapore outbreak, identified nine sequence variations, and discovered a new primary route of introduction of the virus into the Singapore population. They also found a Singaporean origin for a German case of SARS, a result that could not be derived from standard sequencing methods. The analysis of the uncultured lung tissue also found different sequences in a single patient, which suggested the presence of multiple viral sequence variants in one host.</p><p>The study suggests that MS-based genotyping can be used for large-scale genetic characterization of viral DNA from clinical samples. The researchers found that the method was accurate and sensitive, with a 95&#x00025; success rat e for detecting sequence variations at low virus concentrations. The MS-based assay allows high-throughput analysis and complements the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; direct sequence analysis method, which is used to identify new sequence variations. As such, it is particularly useful for investigating agents for which extensive sequence information exists.</p><p>Liu and colleagues propose that the most efficient method for a large-scale population investigation would be initial characterization of a genome sequence by direct sequence analysis in a subset of samples, followed by MS-based analysis of informative genetic variations. Altogether, their results suggest that MS-based genetic analysis can help real-time investigations in disease outbreaks.</p></body></article>
