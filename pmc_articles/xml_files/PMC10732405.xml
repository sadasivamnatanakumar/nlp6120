Specifically, the corresponding author informed PLOS that the <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1009747#pgen-1009747-g003" ext-link-type="uri">Fig 3E&#x02013;3G</ext-link> expression data reported in this study and the corresponding Data D in <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1009747.s008" ext-link-type="uri">S1 Data</ext-link> were inappropriately manipulated.</p><p>The University of California, Davis confirmed that author DPW admitted to manipulation of the data underlying the results presented in <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1009747#pgen-1009747-g003" ext-link-type="uri">Fig 3</ext-link> and <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1009747.s008" ext-link-type="uri">S1 Data</ext-link>.</p><p>The authors repeated the qRT-PCR experiments presented in <xref rid="pgen.1011096.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1E&#x02013;S1G Fig</xref>, using samples obtained from new plant materials. The results of the repeated experiments demonstrated that the transcript levels of the MADS-box genes from class-B and -C showed a highly significant downregulation in the <italic toggle="yes">wapo1</italic> mutant relative to the wildtype, and are available in the <xref rid="pgen.1011096.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref> and S1 Fig files provided with this notice. These results support the conclusion reported in [<xref rid="pgen.1011096.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] that the downregulation of class-B and -C MADS-box genes likely contributed to the defects in anthers and pistils observed in the <italic toggle="yes">wapo1</italic> mutant.</p><p>However, in the repeated experiment data set, the <italic toggle="yes">wapo1</italic> mutant showed a marginally significant downregulation of class-E genes <italic toggle="yes">SEP1-2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">SEP1-4</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">SEP1-6</italic> and a highly significant downregulation of <italic toggle="yes">SEP3-2</italic>, which were not reported in [<xref rid="pgen.1011096.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In light of these findings, a paragraph of the Results section and a paragraph of the Discussion section have been updated below.</p><p>In the <bold>CRISPR <italic toggle="yes">wapo1</italic> mutant shows altered floral morphology</bold> subsection of the Results, the second paragraph is updated to: &#x0201c;Since most of the floral abnormalities in <italic toggle="yes">wapo1</italic> were detected in the internal whorls (lodicules, stamens and pistils), we explored the effect of the <italic toggle="yes">wapo1</italic> mutant on the expression of class-B, -C an -E MADS-box floral genes in developing spikes at the early stamen primordia stage. Relative to the WT, the <italic toggle="yes">wapo1</italic> mutant showed a highly significant down regulation of class-B (<italic toggle="yes">AP3-1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PI1</italic>), class-C (<italic toggle="yes">AG1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">AG2</italic>), and one class-E (<italic toggle="yes">SEP3-2</italic>) MADS-box genes (Fig 3E&#x02013;3G). The other class-E genes, <italic toggle="yes">SEP1-2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">SEP1-4</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">SEP1-6</italic>, showed only small and marginally significant differences (Fig 3G).&#x0201d;</p><p>In the <bold>Floral and spike abnormalities in mutant and transgenic <italic toggle="yes">WAPO-A1</italic> plants</bold> subsection of the Discussion, the first paragraph is updated to: &#x0201c;In addition to its role in the activation of <italic toggle="yes">AP1</italic>, LFY has been shown to bind to regulatory regions of <italic toggle="yes">APETALA3</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">AP3</italic>, a class-B floral gene) and <italic toggle="yes">AGAMOUS</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">AG</italic>, a class-C floral gene) in Arabidopsis [14, 28&#x02013;30]. The activation of <italic toggle="yes">AP3</italic> expression requires the activity of both <italic toggle="yes">LFY</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">UFO</italic>, which likely explains the reported downregulation of class-B genes in the <italic toggle="yes">ufo</italic> mutant in Arabidopsis [13, 14] and class-C genes in the <italic toggle="yes">apo1</italic> mutant in rice [12]. In the developing spikes of the wheat <italic toggle="yes">wapo1</italic> null mutants, we also observed a highly significant downregulation of class-B, and -C genes relative to the WT, suggesting a conserved molecular mechanism. For the class-E genes we observed a highly significant downregulation of <italic toggle="yes">SEP3-2</italic> and only marginally significant differences for the three <italic toggle="yes">SEP1</italic> genes.&#x0201d;</p><p>The PLOS Publication Ethics team reviewed this case in collaboration with the <italic toggle="yes">PLOS Genetics</italic> Editors, and carefully considered case details including the confirmed data manipulation, that the data in question comprise a relatively minor portion of the results, and the reliability of the article&#x02019;s main findings as demonstrated by the repeat data and supported by an Editorial Board member. PLOS issues this Expression of Concern to inform readers of the data manipulation concerns and that findings in <ext-link xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1009747#pgen-1009747-g003" ext-link-type="uri">Fig 3</ext-link> and <ext-link xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1009747.s008" ext-link-type="uri">S1 Data</ext-link> published in [<xref rid="pgen.1011096.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] are unreliable.
