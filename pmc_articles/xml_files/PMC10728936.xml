Owing to the fact that the contentious data in the above article had already been published prior to its submission to <italic>Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine,</italic> the Editor has decided that this paper should be retracted from the Journal. After having been in contact with the authors, they agreed with the decision to retract the paper. The Editor apologizes to the readership for any inconvenience caused.</p></body></article>
