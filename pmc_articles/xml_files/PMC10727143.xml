Early childhood lead exposure can damage the brain and nervous system, slow growth and development, and cause hearing and speech problems (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr"><italic>1</italic></xref>). Screening for elevated blood lead levels (BLL) is essential for routine care of young children. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, substantial disruptions to health care access occurred for routine, preventive care (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>). At the onset of the pandemic (January&#x02013;May 2020), 34% fewer U.S. children aged &#x0003c;6 years received blood lead level testing than during the same months in 2019 (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>). The Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) characterized patterns of blood lead testing among young children in Chicago from the onset of the pandemic in 2019 through 2022.</p><sec sec-type="other1"><title>Investigation and Outcomes</title><p>All children residing in Chicago should be screened for their BLL at age 12, 24, and 36 months (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><italic>4</italic></xref>).

Testing increased in 2021 and again in 2022 but did not return to prepandemic baseline in Chicago. Community areas with the highest average rank of BLLs exceeding the Blood Lead Reference Value during 2010&#x02013;2018 were most affected by pandemic-related decreases in testing. Pandemic-related changes in blood lead testing might have exacerbated longstanding health inequities. The most affected community areas should receive increased attention to promote BLL testing among children at the highest risk for lead exposure. It is important for jurisdictions to evaluate pandemic-related changes in blood lead testing for young children and consider including geographic or demographic unit analyses to assess impact on the most vulnerable communities.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN1"><label>*</label><p>
