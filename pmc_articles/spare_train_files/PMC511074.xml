Many of these receptors are sensitive to selected amino acids, one of these being a receptor for L-arginine (L-Arg). Previous neurophysiological and biophysical studies suggested that this taste receptor is coupled directly to a cation channel and behaves as a ligand-gated ion channel receptor (LGICR). Earlier studies demonstrated that two lectins, <italic>Ricinus communis </italic>agglutinin I (RCA-I) and <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris </italic>Erythroagglutinin (PHA-E), inhibited the binding of L-Arg to its presumed receptor sites, and that PHA-E inhibited the L-Arg-stimulated ion conductance of barbel membranes reconstituted into lipid bilayers.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Both PHA-E and RCA-I almost exclusively labeled an 82&#x02013;84 kDa protein band of an SDS-PAGE of solubilized barbel taste epithelial membranes. Further, both rhodamine-conjugated RCA-I and polyclonal antibodies raised to the 82&#x02013;84 kDa electroeluted peptides labeled the apical region of catfish taste buds. Because of the specificity shown by RCA-I, lectin affinity was chosen as the first of a three-step procedure designed to enrich the presumed LGICR for L-Arg. Purified and CHAPS-solubilized taste epithelial membrane proteins were subjected successively to (1), lectin (RCA-I) affinity; (2), gel filtration (Sephacryl S-300HR); and (3), ion exchange chromatography. All fractions from each chromatography step were evaluated for L-Arg-induced ion channel activity by reconstituting each fraction into a lipid bilayer. Active fractions demonstrated L-Arg-induced channel activity that was inhibited by D-arginine (D-Arg) with kinetics nearly identical to those reported earlier for L-Arg-stimulated ion channels of native barbel membranes reconstituted into lipid bilayers. After the final enrichment step, SDS-PAGE of the active ion channel protein fraction revealed a single band at 82&#x02013;84 kDa which may be interpreted as a component of a multimeric receptor/channel complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The data are consistent with the supposition that the L-Arg receptor is a LGICR. This taste receptor remains active during biochemical enrichment procedures. This is the first report of enrichment of an active LGICR from the taste system of vertebrata.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Chemical senses</kwd><kwd>Taste</kwd><kwd>Signal transduction</kwd><kwd>Lectin</kwd><kwd>Ion channel</kwd><kwd>Receptor</kwd><kwd>Immunohistochemistry</kwd><kwd>Protein purification</kwd><kwd>Lipid bilayer</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The initial event in taste transduction involves recognition of taste stimuli by plasma membrane-associated receptor proteins. These proteins are concentrated at the apical end of specialized neuro-epithelial cells (taste cells) found within multicellular end-organs known as taste buds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The recognition binding sites for most taste stimuli face the exterior environment. The interaction of a taste stimulus with this recognition site triggers a chain of metabolic and ionic events in the taste cell, leading to alterations in membrane conductance, release of neurotransmitter, and a change in the firing rate of the afferent sensory nerve fibers with which taste cells synapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Receptor recognition is, therefore, largely responsible for maintaining the specificity of the taste transduction process.</p><p>To date, 7-transmembrane G protein coupled receptors (7TM-GPCR's) for three taste modalities have been identified by both molecular cloning and through searches of the human and mouse genome. Sweet taste stimuli appear to be recognized by at least one heterodimer (T1R2/T1R3) of the three member family of 7TM-GPCR's, the T1R's [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The taste receptors for sweetness are coupled to changes in intracellular levels of either cyclic nucleotides or polyphosphoinositols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Two GPCR receptor types have been implicated in the basic taste of umami (glutamate taste). One is the heterodimer of T1R1/T1R3, of the same 7TM-GPCR family as the sweet taste receptor dimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Another GPCR umami receptor is an N-terminal truncated metabotropic-type 4 glutamate receptor (taste/mGluR4) presumably coupled to an inhibition of adenylyl cyclase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. A third proposed, non-GPCR umami receptor is an NMDA-type ionotropic glutamate receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Finally, a family (~40 members) of 7TM-GPCR's recognizes many bitter taste stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. These bitter taste receptors are coupled through a gustducin-containing G protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] to changes in intracellular levels of cyclic nucleotides and polyphosphoinositide metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>While these recent discoveries have markedly improved the understanding of taste transduction, it is apparent from neurophysiological, biophysical and biochemical studies that receptors and transduction processes other than the GPCR/second messenger systems are utilized by the sense of taste [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. For example, several taste transduction processes make use of ion channels as the receptor recognition step [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Salty taste is likely transduced by an epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), and sour taste may also make use of channels such as acid sensing ion channels (ASICs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and the hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channel (HCN) (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). Certain stimuli, such as quinine and perhaps denatonium co-opt potassium channels to alter membrane conductance of taste receptor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Finally, in a variety of species, ligand-gated ion channels have been implicated as taste receptors for a number of stimuli, including sugars in the dog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], glutamate in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], nicotinamide in crayfish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], sugars and amino acids in fleshfly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], bitter compounds in frog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], and apparently for amino acids in the channel catfish, <italic>Ictalurus punctatus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Little is known about the structure and function of these ligand-gated ion channel receptors (LGICR) in the taste system nor the extent to which they serve as taste receptors in other species.</p><p>To evaluate the role of LGICRs in taste transduction, receptors of this class need to be identified and fully described. To date, a well characterized example of a likely LGICR class of taste receptors is found on the common channel catfish, <italic>I. punctatus</italic>. The catfish is an advantageous model system for studying taste transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] because it possesses a large number of densely arrayed taste buds across its body surface, particularly on its barbel appendages and gill rakers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], and shows high specificity and sensitivity to selected amino acids. Several taste transduction pathways for amino acids have been identified both biochemically and neurophysiologically, including those recognizing (1) L-alanine and other small neutral amino acids, (2) L-proline, and (3) L-arginine (L-Arg) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>Of these three receptor systems, the one tuned to the amino acid, L-Arg, appears to be of particular high specificity and affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Calcium imaging studies on isolated catfish taste receptor cells suggest the presence of at least two subtypes of L-Arg-stimulated transduction pathways. In one, L-Arg induces a change in intracellular calcium that is independent of extracellular calcium activity. In the other, L-Arg induces an increase in intracellular calcium that is dependent upon extracellular calcium. This second type of L-Arg induced response is blocked by D-Arg, whereas the first type of L-Arg induced response is less sensitive to the D-isomer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Intracellular and patch clamp studies on catfish taste cells are also consistent with there being two subtypes of responses to L-Arg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>The L-Arg induced increase in intracellular calcium independent of extracellular calcium and not blocked by D-Arg may utilize a mechanism such as a GPCR-polyphosphoinositol linked pathway with IP3 releasing calcium from intracellular stores. The other L-Arg-stimulated pathway, showing intracellular changes in calcium dependent upon extracellular calcium and blocked by D-Arg, is consistent with an LGICR mechanism. The LGICR mechanism was given additional credence through studies demonstrating that membranes from barbel epithelium (that contains taste buds), when reconstituted into lipid bilayers, show L-Arg-stimulated ion channel activity inhibited by D-Arg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Using membrane homogenates from catfish barbel epithelium, biochemical binding studies revealed high affinity sites for L-Arg that were inhibited by D-Arg, L-arginine methyl ester, and to a lesser extent by L-lysine and L-&#x003b1;-amino-&#x003b2;-guanidino propionic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Previous studies had also demonstrated that both of the lectins, <italic>Ricinus communis </italic>agglutinin I (RCA-I) and <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris </italic>Erythroagglutinin (PHA-E), inhibited the binding of L-Arg to its presumed receptor sites, and both lectins labelled identical SDS-PAGE-separated bands of a barbel membrane preparation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. L-Arg-stimulated ion channel activity of solubilized barbel (taste) membranes reconstituted into lipid bilayers was inhibited by both PHA-E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and RCA-I (Teeter &#x00026; Brand, unpublished observations). In addition, PHA-E also labelled the apical membrane of selected taste bud cells and solitary chemoreceptor cells of catfish barbel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. When reacted against the exterior epithelium of fixed, unpermeabilized catfish barbel, polyclonal antibodies developed against these lectin reactive peptides immuno-labelled the apical membrane of a subset of barbel taste receptor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>While these prior studies are consistent with the hypothesis that one of the receptors for L-Arg is an LGICR, both the neurophysiological studies and the reconstitution experiments could not definitively test this hypothesis. Without actually isolating an LGICR for L-Arg, it remains possible that a GPCR moiety for L-Arg could conceivably be tightly coupled to a separate ion channel.</p><p>The purpose of the studies reported here was to investigate the possibility that an LGICR exists for L-Arg, by:</p><p>1. biochemically enriching this putative LGICR to near homogeneity, and</p><p>2. biophysically characterizing the L-Arg-stimulated ion channel activity of the presumed LGICR at each step of enrichment to</p><p>&#x02022; demonstrate that the same LGICR is being enriched with each step, and</p><p>&#x02022; demonstrate that the ion channel properties and kinetics of the enriched LGICR are similar to those of the presumed LGICR <italic>in situ</italic>.</p><p>This enrichment and characterization are necessary steps towards eventually cloning this putative LGICR.</p><p>The data are consistent with the interpretation that a receptor for L-Arg can be solubilized in an active state and can be enriched to a point where, upon denaturation and SDS-PAGE, material containing receptor-like activity elutes as a single band.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Lectin specificity: lectin blots and lectin histochemistry</title><p>An SDS-PAGE of a detergent-solubilized epithelial membrane fraction from barbel of <italic>I. punctatus</italic>, called "Sp" (defined in methods), revealed numerous proteins labelled by silver stain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Lane "Sp"). Yet the lectins, PHA-E and RCA-I, both clearly labelled only one major glycoprotein band, in the range of 82 &#x02013; 84 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Lane "PHA" and Lane "RCA"). A few other protein bands were more lightly labelled by these two lectins, including ones near 88 &#x02013; 90 kDa and ~120 kDa. This recognition specificity is notable because previous work had shown that both of these lectins inhibited binding of L-Arg to a membrane suspension of barbel epithelium with respective specificity confirmed by control studies using the hapten sugar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Other lectins that did not inhibit L-Arg binding labelled other glycoproteins of barbel epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies showed that the lectin, PHA-E, labelled primarily exterior-facing (presumably) glycoprotein motifs of the taste buds of catfish barbel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. However, no comparable labelling studies were carried out using RCA-I. Since RCA-I was used in this current study as an affinity reagent, it was important to establish the labelling specificity of RCA-I &#x02013; conjugated lectin to catfish barbel taste buds. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> shows that RCA-I labels primarily the taste buds on the surface of the barbel, with Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> showing labelling of two taste buds in a transverse section at higher magnification. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> demonstrates that the lectin labelled primarily the apical region of the taste bud. Some of the spotty labelling scattered among the taste bud field (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) may due to the RCA-I recognizing an epitope on solitary chemoreceptor cells (SCC). The SCCs are a dispersed chemoreception system found in aquatic vertebrates, and are possibly related to the taste system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Apparent labelling of the catfish SCC was reported with PHA-E as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>The specificity shown by these lectins in binding inhibition, ion channel conductance inhibition, lectin blots, and lectin histochemistry, all give credence to use of lectin affinity chromatography as the first step in enrichment of L-Arg-stimulated channel activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Enrichment of L-Arg-stimulated ion channel activity</title><sec><title>Step 1 &#x02013; lectin chromatography</title><p>Since the lectins, RCA-I and PHA-E, inhibited the binding of L-Arg but not of L-alanine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], the assumption was made that an L-arginine receptor (L-ArgR), or a fragment thereof, was among the glycoproteins labelled by these two lectins, and lectin affinity chromatography was, therefore, chosen as the first step in enrichment of this L-ArgR. Verification of the presence of active putative L-ArgR ion channel in each eluted fraction was assessed by a bilayers &#x02013; incorporation assay. This assay proved to be more readily performed and provided more reproducible results than soluble binding assays that yielded high non-specific binding and required much more material.</p><p>A quantitative protein assessment of the eluted materials from the RCA-I column indicated that over 99% of the protein from fraction Sp passed through the column unbound. Only occasionally did this protein material contain minimal L-Arg-stimulated ion channel activity. In contrast, the remaining protein eluted from the affinity column by galactose and reconstituted into lipid bilayers (See below) consistently contained ion channels activated by L-Arg and inhibited by D-Arg.</p><p>Silver staining of SDS-PAGE separated proteins before (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) and after (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) the RCA affinity enrichment step revealed numerous proteins from total Sp (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) with fewer and more heavily stained bands of protein present in galactose-eluted fractions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). These included primarily protein of molecular weight ~82&#x02013;84 kDa, with apparently lower abundance proteins near 115&#x02013;120 kDa, 60&#x02013;70 kDa, and 40&#x02013;45 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). The 82&#x02013;84 kDa band matched the general position of the principal protein labelled in the lectin blots (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The protein eluting at 115&#x02013;120 kDa in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> may correspond to the lightly labeled glycoproteins at ~120 kDa seen in the lectin blots of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. Protein of molecular weight 60 &#x02013; 70 kDa and 40 &#x02013; 45 kDa observed in the galactose-eluted protein fraction of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> have no apparent match in the lectin blots of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. These may, possibly, be degradation products of the other protein fractions that are labelled by the lectins or they may be proteins of low abundance, visible here due to the enrichment of protein resulting from the affinity procedure.</p><p>On the assumption that the 82&#x02013;84 kDa protein was at least a subunit of this L-ArgR, the SDS-PAGE band at 82&#x02013;84 kDa was electroeluted and used to develop polyclonal antibodies from three guinea pigs (See Methods). The affinity purified and pre-treated polyclonal antibodies from two of these guinea pigs proved most specific and these were labelled, "GP1" and "GP2," respectively. In Western blots of fraction Sp (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), both of the GP antibodies labelled a wide band between 74 and 84 kDa (containing its antigen) and occasionally a second higher molecular weight band near 110 kDa. In Western blots of RCA lectin-galactose eluted proteins, a narrower band of 82&#x02013;84 kDa was labelled (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Little GP labelling was seen in Western blots from SDS-PAGE of the protein not retained by the RCA lectin column, but those bands that were labelled were near 84 kDa and 110 kDa (data not shown).</p><p>The GP polyclonal antibodies were used as a confirmatory marker of the 82&#x02013;84 kDa peptide during subsequent enrichment steps. Both the GP1 and GP2 antibodies labelled the 82&#x02013;84 kDa protein band in Western blots of an SDS solubilized partial membrane preparation from catfish barbel and both immuno-labelled taste cells of the catfish (see ahead).</p></sec><sec><title>Step 2 &#x02013; gel filtration</title><p>The CHAPS-solubilized, dialyzed, non-denatured protein eluted from the galactose wash of the lectin column was applied to a Sephacryl S-300 HR column and eluted with Tris/CHAPS. Each protein-containing peak of the elution was assayed for L-Arg-stimulated channel activity and subjected to SDS-PAGE with silver staining and Western blotting against the GP1 antibody. Only protein from the first peak, in fractions 1 and 2, (eluting at an equivalent molecular weight of &#x0003e; 670 kDa.) contained L-Arg-stimulated ion channel activity (see ahead). Silver staining of material in these first two fractions run on SDS-PAGE revealed a prominent band at 82&#x02013;84 kDa (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). The broad band near 110&#x02013;115 kDa seen after lectin chromatography (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) was not seen while protein at 60&#x02013;70 kDa and 40&#x02013;45 kDa remained. The corresponding Western blot (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>) demonstrated that the antigen to which GP1 was developed was still present in the active fraction.</p></sec><sec><title>Step 3 &#x02013; ion exchange chromatography</title><p>As a final enrichment step eluted material from fractions 1 and 2 of the Sephacryl column were lyophilised and resuspended into Start Buffer (see methods) and loaded on a Hitrap Q anion exchange column. Both the pH 9 and pH 8 elution resulted in protein being released from the column, with the majority of protein eluting at pH9. However, only the pH 9 fraction contained L-Arg-stimulated ion channel activity when reconstituted into lipid bilayers.</p><p>A silver stain of an SDS-PAGE of the pH 9 eluent showed a deeply staining band at 82&#x02013;84 kDa along with weak staining above 200 kDa and in the 35 kDa range (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). There was also an almost complete loss of other stained bands observed in SDS-PAGE of protein from the previous enrichment steps (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref> with Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). The corresponding Western blot of 0.2 &#x003bc;g of the pH 9 eluent showed very strong reactivity at 82&#x02013;84 kDa (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). The SDS-PAGE of the pH 8 eluent showed a faint band at 82&#x02013;84 kDa with other less intense bands at lower molecular weight. This pH 8 eluent may contain an inactive or partially denatured form of the L-ArgR.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry of GP1 and GP2 on catfish barbel</title><p>The GP antibodies were developed against the 82&#x02013;84 kDa fraction of solubilized catfish barbel membranes, since it was a band of this molecular weight that was labelled by the lectins, PHA-E and RCA-I. While it is expected that GP1 and GP2 would label an 82&#x02013;84 kDa band by Western blots, the fact that the GP1 and GP2 antibodies faithfully marked each enriched fraction that exhibited L-Arg-stimulated ion channel activity (see below) suggests that they are immuno labels of the receptor. As such, their localization within the barbel may be a marker for this presumed L-ArgR.</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> shows GP1 and GP2 immuno labelling of paraformaldehyde fixed, sectioned catfish barbel.

Nearly identical L-Arg-stimulated single channel activity was observed from active fractions of all three steps: the galactose-eluted protein from the RCA lectin column, the protein of the first peak, fractions 1 &#x00026; 2, of the material eluted from the Sephacryl S-300 column, and the protein of the pH 9 elution from the ion exchange column. The fact that consistent and nearly identical L-Arg-stimulated activity was observed with material from each subsequent enrichment step indicates that the enrichment procedures were sufficiently benign so as to permit the retention of LGICR-type activity and, presumably, native receptor conformation.</p><p>General agonist/antagonist channel properties.

These data imply that there is one major peak of current amplitude (with some fluctuation) giving a unitary current of -6.6 pA. Similar unitary currents were measured for material from both the lectin column and the ion exchange procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Cation/anion selectivity &#x00026; current/voltage relationship</title><p>The cation-anion selectivity of L-Arg activated channels found in material contained in fractions 1 &#x00026; 2 off the Sephacryl column was determined for Na<sup>+ </sup>and Cl<sup>-</sup>.

The average reversal potential (n = 5 bilayers, &#x000b1; S.D.) elicited by voltage ramps (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>) was -14 &#x000b1; 3 mV. This value corresponds to weak cation selectivity (P<sub>Na</sub>/P<sub>Cl </sub>= 2.2).</p><p>The current-voltage relationships for L-Arg activated channels formed by active protein fractions from all three enrichment steps are illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>.

From these current-voltage relationships it follows that the conductance of the channels from protein at any stage in the enrichment process are nearly identical, and that L-Arg activated ion channels are essentially potential-independent.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with biophysical properties of native channels</title><p>The electrophysiological properties of ion channels formed by the protein fractions throughout the enrichment scheme described here closely resemble those measured for the native channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">I</xref>).

In spite of their likely role in taste, little is known about these LGICRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The best characterised apparent taste LGICRs that recognise non-ionic stimuli are those of the catfish, <italic>I. punctatus</italic>. This animal possesses apparent LGICRs of low affinity for L-proline and of high affinity for L-Arg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>The observation that L-Arg acts as a stimulus for the taste system of the channel catfish was first reported by Caprio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Subsequent neurophysiological and biochemical binding studies demonstrated that, unlike most other vertebrate taste receptors, the catfish taste receptor(s) for L-Arg is of both high specificity and high sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Contemporaneous neurophysiological cross-adaptation and single unit studies indicated that L-Arg stimulates unique sites independent of those for other amino acids such as L-alanine or L-proline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>The receptor sites for L-Arg have narrow structural requirements, with only a few structural analogs of L-Arg acting as cross-adapting stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The receptor binding studies found a high affinity site for L-Arg, with Kd of 20&#x02013;50 nM, and demonstrated inhibition of L-Arg binding by D-Arg, L-arginine methyl ester, and to a lesser extent by L-lysine and L-&#x003b1;-amino-&#x003b2;-guanidino propionic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Other amino acids were without effect at reasonable levels. Interestingly, L-Arg and D-Arg are non-reciprocal cross adaptors, where neural adaptation to D-Arg eliminates responses to L-Arg, while adaptation to L-Arg still leaves some response to D-Arg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. This non-reciprocal cross-adaptation predicts the presence of a receptor site for D-Arg and suggests that any receptor for L-Arg &#x02013; be it a GPCR or an LGICR &#x02013; should be sensitive to D-Arg. The fact that no responses to D-Arg were ever observed in the bilayer experiments suggests that the major receptor for D-Arg is a GPCR. Consistent with these receptor specificities is the behavioural observation that at micromolar levels, L-Arg induces oropharyngeal motor behavior in <italic>I. punctatus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] with D-arginine acting as a partial antagonist of this behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>More recently, whole cell patch clamp and calcium imaging of isolated catfish taste receptor cells, along with earlier <italic>in situ </italic>intracellular electrophysiological recordings, indicated that the majority of L-Arg-induced depolarizations are generated by inward currents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. As predicted by neurophysiological cross-adaptation studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and consistent with biochemical binding experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] the increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>activity observed in taste cells stimulated by L-Arg could be blocked by D-Arg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>Studies in our laboratory demonstrated that plasma membrane vesicles from barbel epithelium incorporated into lipid bilayers displayed L-Arg (&#x003bc;M)-stimulated ion channel activity that was inhibited by D-Arg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. No channel activity was observed toward L-alanine, but another, apparently less abundant, channel was stimulated by mM levels of L-proline, with the L-proline response being inhibited by D-proline. The L-Arg-stimulated responses were not inhibited by D-proline, nor were the L-proline responses inhibited by D-Arg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The L-Arg-stimulated channels were found to be 50&#x02013;80 pS in size, cation selective, but of low ion specificity. In contrast to the taste system, the olfactory system of the catfish transduces the stimulus, L-Arg and some other basic amino acids apparently through a GPCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] as does the olfactory system of goldfish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. In addition, L-Arg is an appetitive stimulus for the leech, Hirudo medicinalis, where the transduction process for L-Arg can be influenced by bitter stimuli, suggesting an integration at the receptor cell level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]</p><p>Preliminary reports on the localization of an L-ArgR showed that the antibodies, GP1, and the lectin, PHA-E, when incubated with intact, unfixed barbels, labelled exterior-facing epitopes on catfish barbel taste buds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and SCCs scattered in the epithelium among taste buds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Immunoelectron microscopy using GP1 revealed labelling primarily on those cells of the taste bud containing large microvilli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Because these data were of surface labelling only, the labelling specificity towards other areas of the taste bud and the barbel epidermis for GP1 and the lectins was not known. This current report demonstrates primarily apical labelling of taste buds by both conjugated RCA-I, GP1 and GP2 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The scattered punctuate labelling seen with both RCA-I and the GP antibodies may represent epitope recognition on solitary chemoreceptor cells (particularly within the epidermis), the apical processes of which were previously shown to label with PHA-E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. As the secondary antibody controls suggest (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>) very little of this punctuate labelling can be attributed to a second antibody effect.</p><p>Considering collectively the neurophysiological, biochemical, behavioural, biophysical and localization data, a putative receptor for L-Arg emerges as one of high structural specificity, with D-Arg acting as an antagonist, one of high sensitivity, and one expressed in the apical membrane of a specific sub-class of taste receptor cells. Yet, because the previous biophysical studies were carried out with intact cells, epithelial homogenates or reconstituted membrane vesicles, the data are insufficient to permit a distinction between the L-ArgR as a single LGICR macromolecular complex and the receptor as two separate entities, a recognition molecule coupled to ion channel activity. To help make this distinction, solubilization and enrichment of the receptor were required. We assumed that if receptor activity survived solubilization and increasing enrichment, and if this receptor appeared to purify as a unitary entity by SDS-PAGE, then it is likely that the major receptor for L-Arg is indeed a LGICR.</p><p>This enrichment procedure was also a necessary first step in cloning the receptor, since partial amino acid sequences may be obtained from the purified product.</p><sec><title>Enrichment of the putative L-ArgR</title><p>The initial enrichment step of lectin affinity was predicated upon the observation that the lectins, RCA-I and PHA-E, inhibited the specific binding of L-Arg to its presumed receptor sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], and that PHA-E and RCA-I inhibited L-Arg-stimulated conductance activity of catfish barbel (taste) membranes reconstituted into lipid bilayers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In addition, both lectins labelled only a few protein bands of an SDS-PAGE of barbel Sp, and only one major band, that near 82&#x02013;84 kDa, was common between the two (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Both conjugated RCA-I and PHA-E labelled cells within the taste buds (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]).</p><p>Lectin affinity chromatography employing agarose bound RCA-I was therefore used to achieve an initial partial enrichment of the putative L-ArgR. RCA-I was chosen for lectin affinity because in our hands it was more stable and easier to work with than the agarose bound PHA-E. In pilot studies, lectin affinity chromatography with PHA-E led to results similar to those obtained with RCA-I.</p><p>The two additional enrichment procedures using Sephacryl-S300 and Hitrap Q ion exchange were chosen to further enrich the putative L-ArgR because both could be carried out using solubilization buffers that were less likely to destroy the activity of the receptor and both are standard biochemical purification techniques. Each chromatography step that retained L-Arg-stimulated ion channel activity resulted in increasingly concentrated and increasingly purified protein of molecular weight near 82&#x02013;84 kDa. This enrichment is readily seen in SDS-PAGE of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, where the protein profile changes dramatically over the course of each chromatography step. The Western blots of material from each step (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A,4B,4C,4D</xref>) suggest a substantial enrichment of the 82&#x02013;84 kDa protein.</p><p>Throughout enrichment, the 82&#x02013;84 kDa band was consistently recognized by the GP1 and GP2 antibodies in Western blots (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). These blots suggest that the same entity(ies) labelled by the lectins was retained and enriched through the course of each chromatography step. The Western blots also speak to the specificity of the antibodies, GP1 and GP2, in that both antibodies labelled almost exclusively the 82&#x02013;84 kDa band. The subsequent observation that GP1 and GP2 recognized epitopes at the apical region of the taste bud (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) indicates that at least a portion of the proteins in the 82&#x02013;84 kDa region are taste cell-related, membrane associated and, given the biophysical characteristics, likely receptors.</p><p>While the 82&#x02013;84 kDa protein(s) may be a major constituent of the active ion channel complex, the actual molecular weight of the active receptor, and therefore some estimate of its quarternary composition, was difficult to determine. Attempts at running native gels led to inconsistent findings. Of the procedures used for enrichment, the Sephacryl column was the one that could, theoretically, at least, give an estimate of the size of the complex. Using this column, all of the L-Arg-stimulated ion channel activity was located within the initial eluted peak (fractions 1 &#x00026; 2). Calibration of the column suggested a molecular weight of &#x0003e; 640 kDa for eluted material at this initial peak. However, this high apparent molecular weight may not represent the actual weight of the unitary LGICR, since, like many other LGICRs, the L-ArgR may form clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Theoretically, use of Sephacryl 400HR should be able to resolve such high molecular weights. However, when Sephacryl 400HR was used, ion channel activity was spread across many eluted fractions, making estimates of unitary molecular weight impossible.</p><p>After these enrichment procedures, the L-Arg-stimulated ion channel activity was retained and the 82&#x02013;84 kDa protein fraction was greatly purified. The correlation of these two observations suggests that protein in the 82&#x02013;84 kDa range is at least part of the L-ArgR.</p></sec><sec><title>Biophysical characteristics of the putative L-ArgR</title><p>The biophysical characteristics of the L-Arg-stimulated channels reconstituted from each step in the enrichment scheme remained nearly unchanged from those described for the channel observed in native membrane fragments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]<bold>:</bold></p><p>1. both channels were activated by the same range of concentration of L-Arg and blocked by the same concentration range of D-Arg (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>);</p><p>2. neither were activated by L-alanine nor by L-proline;</p><p>3. both displayed similar amplitude histograms (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]);</p><p>4. both had similar unitary conductance (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), with the enriched channel displaying unitary conductance of 73 +/- 7 pS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), and the channel in situ displaying two conductance ranges, 40 &#x02013; 60 and 75 &#x02013; 100 pS. This difference is likely due to the difference in buffers, where the bilayer studies were performed in NaCl/CaCl2/MOPS, while the reconstituted membrane in situ studies were performed with a complex ringer buffer (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>);</p><p>5. both channel preparations when stimulated by L-Arg exhibit linear current voltage relationship (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>).</p><p>The results of this study demonstrate that the isolated channel protein shows recognition-specificity for L-Arg and acts as a non-specific ion channel upon binding L-Arg, properties consistent with the <italic>in situ </italic>activity of the putative L-ArgR and consistent with expected taste receptor criteria.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Collectively, the data presented here suggest that one major taste receptor for L-Arg in the catfish, <italic>I. punctatus, </italic>is a ligand-gated ion channel receptor. The active receptor was biochemically enriched from taste bud-containing epithelium and biophysically validated. Immunohistochemical studies using an antibody raised against peptides labelled by lectins that inhibited the binding of L-Arg to a likely receptor revealed specific labelling at the apical region of the taste bud. Analogous with other LGICRs, taste receptor cell depolarization to L-Arg is suggested through L-Arg binding to a receptor site that is associated with and activates an ion channel of low ion selectivity. In the animal, activation of this channel by L-Arg or other select agonists will open the channel and allow influx of Na<sup>+ </sup>and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, present in the mucus covering the taste epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], into the receptor cell. Alternatively, given the relatively low cation/anion ratio, at least part of this charge could be carried by efflux of Cl<sup>-</sup>. This flow of charge will result in cellular depolarization, release of neurotransmitter to the innervating sensory nerve, and transmission of the taste signal to the central nervous system. This enrichment procedure can be used to generate sufficient material for obtaining partial peptide sequences necessary for eventual cloning of this LGICR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Use of the channel catfish for these studies was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Monell Chemical Senses Center.

This preparation was loaded onto a Sephacryl S-300 HR column (1 cm &#x000d7; 40 cm). Fractions of 0.4 ml were eluted from the column with a buffer composed of TRIS Wash plus 0.2% CHAPS. The column was run at 2.4 ml/hr, and the effluent absorbance monitored at 230 nm and 280 nm. Eluted fractions containing measurable protein were evaluated for L-Arg-stimulated ion channel activity by incorporation into a lipid bilayer (See ahead). In addition, SDS-PAGE (See ahead) was performed on each eluted fraction. Those fractions exhibiting L-Arg-stimulated ion channel activity were dialyzed overnight against 2000 ml of Milli-Q water containing 0.05% CHAPS, lyophilized and stored at -80&#x000b0;C.</p><p>The column was calibrated with a Gel Filtration Calibration Kit with protein standards from 158 to 669 kDa.</p></sec><sec><title>Ion exchange chromatography</title><p>All steps in the ion exchange procedure were performed at 4&#x000b0;C. Further enrichment of the fractions exhibiting L-Arg-stimulated ion activity was achieved using an anion exchange column (Hitrap Q). The column was prepared by washing with 5.0 ml of Start Buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH = 9.0), followed by 2.0 ml of Regeneration Buffer (Start Buffer plus 1.0 M NaCl) and then 5.0 ml of Start Buffer. Lyophilized proteins of the active fraction from the gel filtration column were dissolved in 300 &#x003bc;l of Start Buffer and applied to the column. Prior to elution, the loaded column was washed with 2.0 ml Start Buffer. Elution was at 12 ml/h in 400 &#x003bc;l fractions. First, 1.0 ml of First Elution Buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH = 9.0, 500 mM NaCl) was applied to the column followed by (second), 2.0 ml of Start Buffer (no NaCl), followed by (third) 4.0 ml of Second Elution Buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH = 8.0, 500 mM NaCl). Effluent from the column was monitored with in line UV (230 and 280 nm) and conductivity detectors. Each fraction was assayed for L-Arg-stimulated activity (See ahead.). The active fractions were pooled, dialyzed overnight against 2000 ml of Milli-Q water containing 0.05% CHAPS, lyophilized, and stored at -80&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Development of polyclonal antibodies</title><p>The procedure for development of antibodies against the catfish barbel peptides labelled by the lectins, RCA-I and PHAE has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Briefly, electroeluted material from that area of a gel congruent with an identical gel labelled by the lectins was injected into three female guinea pigs using a schedule and procedure previously found to raise high titer polyclonal antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Antisera were aliquoted into 500 &#x003bc;l lots in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes and kept frozen at -80&#x000b0;C until used. Antisera from animal #1 (GP1) and animal &#x00026;2 (GP2) were found to be the most specific in that they reacted primarily with their antigen within the 82&#x02013;84 kDa band in Western blots of SDS-PAGE of catfish barbel membranes.</p><p>The IgG fraction of GP1 and GP2 antisera was purified using an E-Z-SEP antibody purification kit (Pharmacia). To reduce non-specific binding in the immunohistochemical studies and Western blots, the GP1 and GP2 antibodies were incubated with powder derived from an acetone precipitation of a catfish brain homogenate. One ml of E-Z-SEP-purified antibody was incubated with 10 mg of powder for 40 min at 4&#x000b0;C. The powder was removed by centrifugation and the procedure was repeated once with fresh powder. The resulting pretreated antibodies are called simply, "GP1" and "GP2."</p></sec><sec><title>Gel electrophoresis, lectin blots and Western blots</title><p>Tris-glycine gels (4&#x02013;20%, Bio-Rad) were used for SDS-PAGE. Protein of fractions before any chromatography (i.e., Sp), as well as those from each chromatography step, were denatured by mixing 10 &#x003bc;l from each fraction, 1:1, with sample buffer containing 125 mM Tris-HCl (pH = 8.0), 20% glycerol, 4% SDS, 4% &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol and 50 &#x003bc;g/ml bromophenol blue, and placing the mix in a boiling water bath for 5 min. Gels were run at a constant 20&#x02013;25 mA for about 1 h, using prestained broad range molecular weight markers (Bio-Rad) in 1 or more lanes. Proteins were stained with Bio-Rad Silver Stain Plus kit.</p><p>For lectin blots, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose sheets (Bio-Rad Mini Trans-Blot, Hercules, CA). The sheets were incubated in a blocking solution (2% gelatine, phosphate buffered saline [(PBS) (150 mM NaCl, 100 mM sodium phosphate, pH = 7.4)] and 0.05% Tween 20) for 2 h at room temperature, and then incubated with biotinylated RCA-I or PHA-E (10 &#x003bc;g/ml) overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Following exposure to biotinylated lectin, nitrocellulose sheets were washed extensively with blocking solution. Lectin-bound protein bands were visualized using a Vectastain peroxidase ABC kit with a 4 CN Membrane Peroxidase Substrate system. Development was stopped after one hour using 5% glacial acetic acid.</p><p>For Western blots, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and incubated in blocking solution (PBS, pH = 7.4, 5% non-fat dry milk, 1% goat serum and 0.05% TWEEN 20) for 2 h at ambient temperature with constant slow rocking (Nutator). The nitrocellulose was incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C (rocking) with primary antibody (GP1, 1/500) in blocking solution. The nitrocellulose was washed with blocking solution and incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody (1:250) for 1 h with slow rocking. Bands were visualized as above.</p></sec><sec><title>Lectin histochemistry and immunohistochemistry</title><p>Rhodamine-conjugated RCA-I (Vector Labs) was used to estimate the specificity of lectin interaction with glycoproteins of catfish barbel. To assess the localization of the antigen contained in the 82&#x02013;84 kDa band from the SDS-PAGE of a membrane fraction of catfish barbel (and thereby the likely localization of the putative taste receptor for L-Arg), immunohistochemistry was performed using the GP1 and GP2 antibodies pretreated as described above.</p><p>Barbels were removed from euthanized albino channel catfish (<italic>I. punctatus</italic>) (the fish being 5 &#x02013; 7 cm in length) and immediately placed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde (PFA) (0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2&#x02013;7.4) for eight hours at 4&#x000b0;C. After washing out the PFA with several rinses of excess buffer, the barbels were placed successively in 10%, 20%, and 30% sucrose (in buffer) for 24 hr, all at 4&#x000b0;C. After the final cryoprotect sucrose step, barbels were cut into pieces of less than 1 cm and mounted with M-1 Embedding Matrix (Thermo Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA). The tissue was sectioned at 10 microns on a Microm HM500OM cryostat.</p><p>For lectin histochemistry, ten micron sections of fixed barbel were incubated in the dark with rhodamine-conjugated RCA-I lectin (Vector Labs., Burlingame, CA), diluted 1/200 for 2 to 3 hr at ambient temperature. The sections were then washed quickly with Dulbecco's PBS (GIBCO/Invitrogen Corp), followed by three incubation washes of 10 min each.</p><p>For immunohistochemistry, 10 micron barbel sections, pre-washed 3 times for 10 min each in Dulbecco's PBS, were first incubated at ambient temperature for 3 to 5 hr in blocking buffer consisting of 3% bovine serum albumin, 2% goat serum, 0.3% TritonX100, and 0.1% sodium azide in Dulbecco's PBS at pH 7.1. The sections were then incubated with primary antibody, GP1 or GP2, in blocking buffer for 18 hr at 4&#x000b0;C. The primary antibody solution was removed and the sections were then washed once quickly with Dulbecco's PBS, followed by three incubation washes with PBS of 10 min each. The sections were then incubated in the dark with second antibody, Cy3-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs., West Grove, PA) at 1:1000 dilution for 60 min. at ambient temperature. The secondary antibody was removed and the sections washed once quickly with Dulbecco's PBS, followed by three incubation washes with PBS of 10 min each. Excess fluid was removed from the slides and the sections mounted under cover slips with VectaShield (Vector Labs). Sections were observed with a Nikon Microphot FXA fluorescence microscope, photographed, and images sized and enhanced using the GNU Image Manipulation Program software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>].</p><p>Immuno-specificity was verified by running negative controls where the primary antibody was omitted from the procedure. In all cases, this control step showed no taste bud labelling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>). The scattered, spotty background labelling seen with the primary antibodies is likely due to both an unknown factor in pre-immune serum and to labelling of solitary chemoreceptor cells in the barbel epithelium, as was previously documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Lipid bilayer reconstitution</title><p>Reconstitution of protein fractions containing likely L-Arg-stimulated channel activity was carried out with material from the low osmolar and galactose-eluted fractions of the lectin affinity procedure, from the protein-containing fractions off the Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration column and from each fraction of the ion exchange column. Lipid vesicles were prepared by sonication of 5 mg of DOPE:DOPC (2:1) and 0.5 ml of 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH = 7.2), 300 mM NaCl and 500 mM sucrose, to which 10 &#x003bc;g n-octylglucoside was added. To prepare the liposome-detergent mixture for incorporation into a lipid bilayer, approximately 0.2 to 0.5 &#x003bc;g of presumed receptor protein was added to the liposome in a cassette dialysis unit, and the mixture dialyzed overnight against 2000 ml of the Tris/NaCl/sucrose buffer at 4&#x000b0;C.</p><p>Virtually solvent-free lipid bilayer membranes were prepared as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. The membrane-forming solution was an equimolar mixture of DOPS:DOPE in hexane. The bilayer chamber consisted of two symmetrical halves of a Teflon chamber, each with solution volumes of 1 ml divided by a 15 &#x003bc;m thick Teflon partition containing a round aperture of about 150 &#x003bc;m diameter. Hexadecane in n-hexane (1:10, v/v) was used for aperture pre-treatment. A pair of Ag-AgCl electrodes was connected to the solution in the chamber via 3 M KCl-4% agar bridges. "Virtual ground" was maintained at the <italic>trans </italic>side of the bilayer.</p><p>The bilayer was bathed symmetrically with 5 mM MOPS (pH 7.2), 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 mM NaCl (unless otherwise stated). Fifty to 100 &#x003bc;l of the dialyzed liposome vesicles containing presumed receptor was added to the <italic>cis</italic>-side of the membrane. Fusion of the vesicles was initiated mechanically by gently mixing the membrane bathing solution from the <italic>cis</italic>-side using a micro-pipette. L-Arg was added to the <italic>cis </italic>side approximately 20 min after addition of vesicles. Unless otherwise stated all other additions of reagents also were made from the <italic>cis </italic>side. Channel sidedness was determined by sensitivity of the bilayer to L-Arg. The orientation of the channels was such that the L-Arg sensitive side was normally in the <italic>cis </italic>compartment. All bilayer experiments were performed at room temperature.</p><p>The current was amplified by a Dagan 3900 integrating patch-clamp amplifier (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN) in the voltage clamp mode. Single channel data were digitized at 15 kHz (Digidata 1200, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and analyzed using pClamp6 (Axon Instruments) and Origin 5.1 (Microcal Software, North Hampton, MA) software on an IBM compatible computer.</p><p>The calculated success rate of incorporation of vesicular proteoliposomes into lipid bilayers was about 25%. Success rate is defined as the ratio of the number of successful incorporation attempts to the total number of incorporation attempts (an "incorporation attempt" refers here to the formation of a new bilayer and application of putative channel protein). Over the course of these studies, the number of incorporation attempts for each fraction tested as indicated above was about ten.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>WG developed the enrichment procedures and drafted the manuscript.
