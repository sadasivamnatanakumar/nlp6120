Consequently, characterization of these cellular processes will be essential for any understanding of viral life cycles, and may provide cellular targets for new antiviral therapies.</p><p>The susceptibility to virus infection varies greatly among different cell types, and virus-resistant cells frequently emerge post-infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This suggests that host cell contributions to the virus life cycle, although complex, have genetic determinants. We therefore used a genetic approach to identify cellular genes required for infection by reovirus, a small cytolytic RNA virus that replicates in the cytoplasm. A gene trap retrovirus was use to create libraries of rat intestinal epithelial (RIE-1) cell clones in which each clone contained a single gene disrupted by an integrated retrovirus. The mutant libraries were then infected with reovirus, and resistant clones were selected. We hypothesized that genes mutated by gene entrapment may confer reovirus resistance as a result of either haploinsufficiency or loss of heterozygosity and could be identified by characterizing the genes disrupted by the entrapment vector. From these experiments we have isolated 152 clones and have characterized mutations in 111 different genes, providing potential candidates required for reovirus infection and/or cell killing. Many of the disrupted genes have known or imputed functions, and several are known to function in the same or related pathways. For example, four mutations affected genes in the insulin growth factor-2 (IGF-II) pathway, including genes encoding the IGF-ll/manose-6-phosphate receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] (<italic>Igf2r</italic>, locus ID 25151), the IGF binding protein 5 protease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] (<italic>Prss11</italic>, locus ID 65164, 2 clones), and CTCF (<italic>Ctcf</italic>, locus ID 83726), a transcriptional repressor of the IGF-II gene (<italic>Igf2</italic>) involved in paternal imprinting.</p><p>The frequency of mutations involving the IGF-II pathway led us to investigate the role of IGF-II in reovirus infection. Clone 6B72, which contains a mutation in <italic>Ctcf </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], was found to over express <italic>Igf2 </italic>transcripts, consistent with the known role of CTCF as a transcriptional repressor of the <italic>Igf2 </italic>gene. Moreover, forced expression of IGF-II in RIE-1 cells was sufficient to confer cellular resistance to lytic reovirus infection. Enforced IGF-II expression also transformed RIE-1 cells to anchorage independent growth, a phenotype associated with malignant change. These results represent the first use of gene entrapment to identify components of host cell metabolism required for virus infection and illustrate a potential mechanism of carcinogenesis associated with chronic virus infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Disruption of the CTCF gene results in cells resistant to lytic infection by reovirus</title><p>Gene entrapment strategies to identify host genes required virus replication depend on methods to select for virus resistant clones present at about one in 10<sup>4</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>5 </sup>mutagenized cells. Unfortunately, cells persistently infected with reovirus (PI) can emerge at high frequencies (one in 10<sup>2</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>3</sup>) and are intrinsically resistant to the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In preliminary studies, we found that hepa 1/a cells were not suitable for genetic studies due to the emergence of PI clones. However, persistently infected rat intestinal epithelial cells (RIE-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] were found to require a serum survival factor and die when placed in serum free media (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). <italic>In vitro </italic>infection of RIE-1 cells with reovirus also appears to mirror virus replication in the rodent host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Consequently, RIE-1 cells were used in the present study, and reovirus-resistant clones were selected in serum-free medium to remove PI survivors. RIE-1 cells were mutagenized by using the U3NeoSV1 gene trap shuttle vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] (see Methods) and the resulting libraries of mutagenized cells were infected with reovirus serotype 1/Lang at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 35, to select for clones resistant to lytic infection. The isolated clones did not express reoviral antigens, and did not produce infectious virus as assessed by plaque assay, suggesting these reovirus resistant clones were not PI.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Persistently infected RIE-1 cells fail to survive in serum-free media. </bold>RIE-1 parental cells and cells persistently infected with reovirus type 1 were plated in complete medium (FBS<sup>+</sup>) or in media in which the serum was omitted (FBS<sup>-</sup>).

Altogether, of the 151 isolated clones, 62% of flanking sequences matched known or presumptive genes, and an additional 23% were represented in the public databases of expressed sequence tags (dbEST) or non-redundant sequences (nr). From the 111 clones matching known or presumptive genes, 10 genes were represented more than once. Many of the disrupted genes have known or imputed functions, and several are known to function in the same or related pathways. For example, the library included 4 independent mutations involving three genes that encoded proteins associated with the insulin growth factor-2 (IGF-II) signalling pathway, namely, IGF-ll/manose-6-phosphate receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] (<italic>Igf2r</italic>, locus ID 25151), the IGF binding protein 5 protease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] (<italic>Prss11</italic>, locus ID 65164, 2 clones), and CTCF (<italic>Ctcf</italic>, locus ID 83726), a transcriptional repressor of IGF-II involved in paternal imprinting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].

Levels of CTCF protein in 6B72 cells were reduced by about 50% as assessed by western blot analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), consistent with the disruption of one allele. Diminished CTCF expression was associated with an increase in <italic>Igf2 </italic>transcripts as assessed by Northern blot hybridization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). In addition, two products were amplified from 6B72 cells by RT-PCR using primers flanking the IGF-II pro-hormone coding sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). The first product was identical to the rat IGF-II pro-hormone (pro-IGF-II) coding sequence (Accession X17012), whereas, the second contained 14 additional nucleotides generated by splicing of exon 2 to an alternative splice acceptor located 14 nucleotides upstream of the normal <italic>Igf2 </italic>exon 3 splice acceptor site. The alternative transcript is expected to encode a pro-IGF-II protein extending 11 amino acids into the E-peptide sequence ending in a stretch of 60 amino acids lacking homology with any known protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>CTCF and <italic>Igf2 </italic>expression in RIE-1 and 6B72 cells. </bold>Levels of CTCF protein were assessed by Western blot analysis (A), normalized to a &#x003b2;-actin control.

Additionally, there was a dramatic difference in the survival of 6B72 cells after being exposed to high titres of reovirus type 1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>IGF-II modulates reovirus resistance in RIE-1 and 6B72 cells. </bold>RIE-1 and 6B72 cells expressing either the IGF-II pro-hormone (proIGF2) or the alternatively spliced transcript (IGF2<sup>SV</sup>, Figure 3D) were challenged with serial dilutions of reovirus type 1 (upper panel), and the surviving cells were stained with gentian violet 4 days post-infection. The multiplicity of infection (MOI) for each row is indicated. pro-IGF-II converted RIE-I cells to a reovirus resistant phenotype (RIE-1/proIGF2) but had little if any effect on already-resistant 6B72 cells (6B72/proIGF2). Plasmids expressing the alternatively spliced Igf2 transcript had no effect on RIE-1 cells (RIE-1/IGF2<sup>SV</sup>) but abrogated virus resistance in 6B72 cells (6B72/IGF2<sup>SV</sup>).

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> expression of wild type (<italic>Igf2</italic>), but not the splice variant (<italic>Igf2</italic><sup><italic>sv</italic></sup>) increased the resistance of RIE-1 cells to reovirus infection by over 100 fold.

Expression of the <italic>Igf2 </italic>gene in an anti-sense orientation caused no significant difference in the capacity of 6B72 cells to resist infection (data not shown). These studies suggest that increased <italic>Igf2 </italic>expression in 6B72 cells is associated with their capacity to resist reovirus infection, and that the <italic>Igf2</italic><sup><italic>sv</italic></sup>encodes a trans-dominant isoform that blocks the activity of <italic>Igf2</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>The IGF-II hormone confers resistance to lytic infection</title><p><italic>Igf2 </italic>transcripts encode a pro-hormone of 180 amino acids that is processed to generate the 67-residue IGF-II protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

We have isolated over 100 potential clones with mutations in genes that may play roles in the life cycle of reovirus. In the present study, one clone resistant to reovirus lytic infection contained a provirus inserted into the gene encoding the CTCF transcriptional regulator. CTCF binding motifs are present in many genes, including <italic>Igf2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], <italic>H19 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and <italic>Myc </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, since 3 other clones selected for reovirus resistance contained mutations in the IGF-II pathway, the role of IGF-II in virus-resistance was investigated further. Reduced expression of the <italic>Ctcf </italic>gene was associated with enhanced <italic>Igf2 </italic>expression in virus-resistant cells, while forced expression of the <italic>Igf2 </italic>gene in the parental RIE-1 line was sufficient to confer resistance to lytic reovirus infection.</p><p>By inference, the recovery of inserts affecting other genes in the IGF-II signalling pathway suggests that mutations in multiple genes may affect the same phenotype by acting on a common pathway. The insert in <italic>Igf2r </italic>was found to decrease the expression of the gene as assayed by northern blot analysis (data not shown). As IGF-II targets the <italic>igf2r </italic>to lysosomal degradation, mutations in the genes encoding either the receptor (<italic>Igf2r</italic>) or its ligand (<italic>Igf2</italic>) will affect the activity of the other, and result in a reduced endosomal trafficking of hydrolases necessary for reovirus disassembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Our data indicates there is a decrease in virus disassembly in 6B72 cells, consistent with a block at this step in morphogenesis. Further studies will be required to assess if and how inserts in the <italic>Prss11 </italic>and <italic>Igf2r </italic>genes influence reovirus resistance.</p><p>As the entry, disassembly, transcription, translation, and repacking of viruses share common features; we anticipate that common cellular pathways will influence infection by other virus families. Indeed, <italic>Igf2r </italic>has been implicated in herpes simplex and zoster virus infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. However, the present study is the first to show a direct connection between <italic>Igf2 </italic>gene expression and resistance to lytic virus infection. By using constructs that encode the mature hormone without the E-peptide, we were able to show that forced IGF-II expression is sufficient to confer a reovirus resistant phenotype. These results differ from other studies in which reovirus replication was enhanced by treatment of RIE-1 cells with insulin. The latter effect is presumably caused by enhanced virus replication associated with cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Expression of the <italic>Igf2 </italic>gene is frequently elevated in common childhood and adult neoplasms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and has been associated with tumour progression and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. <italic>Igf2 </italic>also transformed RIE-1 cells to anchorage-independence, a phenotype that predicts the potential for malignant growth <italic>in vivo</italic>. Virus-resistant 6B72 cells also grew in soft agar, presumably as a result of enhanced IGF-II expression. Since plasmids expressing only IGF-II were less active in transforming RIE-1 cells to anchorage independence than vectors expressing the entire pro-hormone, further study is needed to determine whether the capacity of RIE-1 cells to proliferate in soft agar is enhanced by the E-peptide or other products derived from the carboxy terminus of the pro-hormone. In other studies, the E-peptide enhanced insulin secretion from &#x003b2;-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and may play a role in cellular transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>cDNA clones of an alternatively spliced <italic>Igf2 </italic>transcript (<italic>Igf2</italic><sup><italic>sv</italic></sup>), blocked the ability of IGF-II to promote reovirus resistance and anchorage independent growth in a trans-dominant manner. The protein coding sequence of <italic>Igf2</italic><sup><italic>sv</italic></sup>contains a frame shift in the E-peptide region and lacks a site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] required for the proteolytic processing of the pro-hormone. The alternative splice site is used very infrequently [only one EST (AA259833) in dbEST was similarly spliced] and thus probably plays no physiological role. Further studies are planned to determine molecular basis for the dominant negative activity of <italic>Igf2</italic><sup><italic>sv</italic></sup>.</p><p>6B72 cells were highly resistant to reovirus infection as determined by virus yield and cell survival at different times post-infection. Virus resistance was a genetically selected trait manifested by clonally pure cell populations, could be conferred by enforced IGF-II expression, and involved decreases in virus disassembly. Although decreased virus disassembly is sufficient to explain virus resistance, we do not exclude the possibility that other mechanisms may contribute to the resistance of 6B72 cells, since any genetic selection may generate clones with multiple, independent mutations. The fact that an early step in infection (uptake/disassembly) is defective in 6B72 cells makes it very difficult to test whether downstream steps might also be affected.</p><p>While the original impetus of our studies was to understand the replication cycle of intracellular pathogens that cause acute and chronic infectious diseases, the finding of cell growth phenotypes associated with virus resistance is of some interest. It has been proposed that lytic viruses may used to treat certain malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. However, based upon our observations, such therapy may carry a risk associated with selection of virus resistant cell clones with enhanced growth/survival potential. Additionally, chronic infections contribute to the development of a number of human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. While the carcinogenic process is not well understood, cell proliferation associated with inflammation is also thought to contribute to tumour promotion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. The present study illustrates how carcinogenesis could also be influenced by selection for virus-resistant cells with mutations in genes affecting cell proliferation or survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This is the first reported use of gene entrapment to identify host genes affecting the susceptibility of cells to virus infection. These results indicate that IGF-II, and by inference other components of the IGF-II signaling pathway, can confer high levels of resistance to lytic reovirus infection. IGF-II expression specifically blocked virus disassembly. <italic>Ctcf </italic>disruption and forced <italic>Igf2 </italic>expression both enabled cells to proliferate in soft agar, a phenotype associated with malignant growth <italic>in vivo</italic>.
