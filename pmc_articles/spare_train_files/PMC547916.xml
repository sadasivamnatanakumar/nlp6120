Prevention of new or recurrent intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is the primary rationale for treating AVMs. The optimal management of AVMs is not well defined, and the risk of aggressive surgical therapy can be significantly high. There is a subset of AVM patients that are considered to be inoperable due to the location and size of their lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. To date, there is no clinically available pharmacological treatment of inoperable AVMs to decrease the rate of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage.</p><p>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of proteolytic enzymes, degrade extracellular matrix proteins, cell surface molecules, and other peri-cellular substances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Excessive degradation of the vascular matrix by MMPs may result in the destabilization of the blood vessel that potentially leads to weakening of the vessel wall, passive dilatation, and rupture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Previously, we reported increased levels of MMP-9 activity in AVMs that may result in vascular instability associated with growth and bleeding.</p><p>There is an increasing interest in utilizing MMP inhibitors in treating vascular diseases including abdominal aortic aneurysms. Doxycycline is a clinically available antibiotic agent that possesses non-specific inhibitory effects on various MMPs, and for years it has had a well-established safety record in treating infectious diseases.</p><p>The primary aim of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing doxycycline as an MMP inhibitor to decrease MMP-9 activity in AVMs and potentially decrease the rate of spontaneous hemorrhage. This exploratory investigation supports the concept that further studies be conducted to document the ability of tetracycline and its derivatives to decrease MMP-9 levels in AVM nidal tissue. Such a demonstration could provide a firm rationale for proceeding with clinical trials to test the hypothesis that tetracycline and its derivatives are useful to decrease the rate of spontaneous hemorrhage from AVMs in otherwise untreatable patients or in those awaiting interventional treatment.</p><p>First, we demonstrate that doxycycline can decrease MMP-9 activity in cultured AVM tissues as a proof of the concept. Further, we present results from a pilot clinical study demonstrating effects of oral doxycycline treatment on MMP-9 expression in AVM tissues.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Ex-vivo treatment of cultured AVM tissues</title><p>After institutional review and informed consent, we obtained AVM specimens after microsurgical resection. AVM nidus was dissected away from any adjacent brain tissue in the operating room and a representative portion of nidus tissue was used for ex-vivo treatment. Ex-vivo culture of AVM tissue was performed using previously described method with modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>AVM tissues were minced into 1&#x02013;2 mm fragments and vigorously washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Blood cells dissociated from the tissues were removed by filtration. AVM tissue fragments were placed onto cell culture inserts and immersed in cell culture medium. During the first 24 hours, AVM tissues were incubated in DME H-21 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) to aid in tissue recovery. Following this recovery period, tissue debris and dissociated cells were removed, and AVM tissues were incubated in DME H-21 medium containing 1% FBS for 4 hours. The tissue fragments were equally divided into 12&#x02013;24 wells. Then AVM tissues were incubated in the medium containing PBS (control) or doxycycline (1, 5, 10 and 100 &#x003bc;g/ml). Each group included 3&#x02013;5 wells. Size of the tissues dictated a number of treatment groups in each specimen.</p><p>Medium from each well was collected after 48 hours. Active and total MMP-9 were measured using substrate zymography. Medium was mixed with SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.) and separated under non-reducing conditions in a 10% zymogram gel (Invitrogen) containing 0.1% gelatin incorporated as a substrate. Recombinant MMP-2 and MMP-9 proteins (R&#x00026;D systems) were used as positive controls. After running, the gel was incubated with renaturing buffer (Invitrogen). The gel was then incubated with developing buffer (Invitrogen) overnight at 37&#x000b0;C. The gel was then stained with colloidal blue stain (Invitrogen). Proteolytic bands in the zymogram gels were quantified using Image J Software (NIH).</p><p>Tissue viability was assessed by measuring the amount of LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) released in the medium according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche, Penzburg, Germany). Some of the tissue fragments were embedded in paraffin for histological assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Pilot clinical study</title><p>Fourteen AVM patients received either 100 mg of doxycycline or placebo twice a day for one week, prior to elective AVM resection. During the AVM resection, AVM tissues were collected, and nidus tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissues were stored at -80&#x000b0;C until analysis. Clinical data were collected as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The specimens were homogenized and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes. We used total MMP-9 ELISA kit (R&#x00026;D) and active MMP-9 ELISA kit (Amersham).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation. The data for total MMP-9 and active MMP-9 from ex-vivo AVM tissues are presented as a relative expression with control brain samples as 100%.

AVM tissue-I was divided into 9 wells and treated with 0, 10, and 100 ng/ml of doxycycline (3 wells for each). Two doxycycline doses were selected to test (1) whether an average doxycycline concentration (10 ng/ml) achieved by standard clinical treatment has any effects on MMP-9 in AVM tissue, and (2) whether a high concentration of doxycycline (100 ng/ml) has any effects of viability of AVM tissues in vitro.</p><p>There was a gradual increase in LDH release over the course of 8 days, indicating continuous cellular death and a gradual decrease in tissue viability (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

By decreasing MMP-9 activity in AVM tissues, doxycycline may be able to restore the structural stability of AVM blood vessels and modify the clinical course of AVMs. Our data will provide the basis to conduct a clinical study to assess effects of tetracycline derivative treatment on the prevention of hemorrhage from AVMs.</p><p>MMP-9 is a major enzyme that degrades the vascular extracellular matrix and has been implicated in a number of vascular diseases that involve abnormal angiogenesis and vascular remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. MMPs are reported to be increased in cerebral aneurysms, atherosclerotic carotid plaque, and abdominal aortic aneurysm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. MMPs are emerging as a potentially new therapeutic target to treat vascular diseases. It has been proposed that pharmacological inhibition of MMPs may stabilize the unstable blood vessels and prevent complications such as vessel rupture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm, doxycycline treatment for one week prior to the repair surgery resulted in decreased MMP-9 and MMP-2 in the wall of the aneurysms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Similar results have been reported in patients with atherosclerotic carotid plaques who received doxycycline for 2&#x02013;8 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Our data using ex-vivo AVM tissues showed that abnormally high levels of MMP-9 expression in AVM tissues could be reduced by a clinically relevant concentration of doxycycline (i.e. 1&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;g/ml). In patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm, doxycycline treatment at a conventional dose, 200 mg/day, resulted in a mean plasma concentration of doxycycline at 4.6 &#x003bc;g/ml with a range of 1.3 to 14.4 &#x003bc;g/ml in humans, and there was a corresponding reduction in plasma MMP-9 levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Similar plasma levels of doxycycline in mice successfully inhibited growth of experimental abdominal aortic aneurysms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We were able to show that doxycycline at 10 &#x003bc;g/ml for as short as 48 hours can reduce MMP-9 expression in AVM tissues. A longer duration of treatment often used in clinical settings may result in a more pronounced reduction in MMP-9 expression in AVM tissues.</p><p>One of the limitations of the ex-vivo study was the relatively short duration of doxycycline treatment. We chose 48 hours treatment to ensure tissue viability and integrity. Although we chose the doxycycline concentrations based on plasma doxycycline levels achieved by a commonly used therapeutic regimen, it is possible that tissue levels of doxycycline might be significantly lower than those of plasma. Furthermore, functional consequences of the reduction of MMP-9 in AVMs need to be examined in animal models or clinical studies. However, at the present time, there is no animal model that approximates recurrent intracranial hemorrhage from AVMs. There are models that can mimic certain aspects of the AVM phenotype. Hyperstimulation of mouse brain with VEGF using adenoviral transduction causes an increase in capillary density, increased MMP-9 activity, and may, in the appropriate genetic background, result in small vascular malformations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Doxycycline can reduce capillary density and MMP-9 activity in this model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Doxycycline has been shown in other human vascular diseases to reduce MMP levels. For example, Axisa et al. treated patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy with doxycycline or placebo for 2&#x02013;8 weeks. Although MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-9 were reported to be increased, only MMP-1 had a statistically significant reduction by doxycycline; there was a trend for MMP-9 to be decreased by 22%. Baxter et al. used a much longer treatment period, 6 months, in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm. They reported a gradual reduction of plasma MMP-9 levels by oral doxycycline over 6 month treatment period (baseline vs 3 months vs 6 months: 119 &#x000b1; 38 vs 84 &#x000b1; 33 vs 66 &#x000b1; 24 ng/ml) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>To further explore the feasibility of a clinical application of doxycycline in modifying the clinical course of AVMs, we conducted a pilot clinical trial. This trial was primarily designed to test the effects of a short-term treatment with oral doxycycline on the expression of MMP-9 in AVM tissues. Despite the small sample size and short duration of treatment used in this study, there was a clear trend for one week of oral doxycycline treatment prior to surgical resection to reduce expression of both active and total MMP-9 in AVM tissues. These results indicate the feasibility of oral treatment with tetracycline derivatives in reducing MMP-9 activity in AVM tissues.</p><p>Despite a large difference in the mean values of MMP levels in our pilot data, variance of MMP levels was high. Accordingly, a sample size of 46 in each group would be needed to demonstrate a difference in active MMP-9, assuming an alpha of 0.05 and power of 80%. However, variance may be reduced by utilizing a longer duration of treatment, as suggested by studies in other diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. A clinical study with a modestly larger sample size and longer treatment duration should suffice to verify effects of oral doxycycline on reducing MMP-9 activity in AVMs.</p><p>There are some further considerations that may account for our high variance that could be avoided in future studies. Surgical AVM tissues consist mainly from nidal tissues, but they may contain intervening astroglial or neuronal tissues that may not express angiogenic factors to the same extent as nidal tissue. Histological examination of each AVM tissue fragments to confirm a predominance of nidal tissues may yield more homogenous tissue and decrease variability in MMP-9 levels. Some of the homogenized samples underwent a several "thaw-freeze" processes during the preliminary phase of the experiments, which may have increased variability in MMP-9 levels. Embolization treatment may affect production and activation of MMPs. Our previous study, however, showed no association between MMP-9 and embolization treatment in 37 AVM patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Based on the experience from this pilot study, future studies can be performed in a more standardized fashion to decrease tissue-to-tissue variability.</p><p>We used different methods to measure MMP-9 in the medium collected from ex-vivo AVM tissues and homogenized AVM tissues from the pilot clinical trial. We chose zymography, a gel based method detecting enzymatic activity of MMPs, for ex-vivo AVM tissues, because the medium volume that can be used for MMP-9 assay was extremely limited, and our preliminary experiments showed higher sensitivity of zymography compared to ELISA. One of the disadvantages of using zymography is that "gel-to-gel" variability in sensitivity makes it difficult to combine the data obtained from multiple gels. On the other hand, ELISA method allows researchers to assay approximately 40 samples at a time when duplicates are used. In addition, establishing a standard curve, ELISA method can express MMP-9 expression values by the absolute unit such as &#x003bc;g/ml or ng/100 &#x003bc;g protein. Therefore, for the clinical pilot trial, in order to quantitatively compare MMP-9 expression among a large number of samples originally planned, we used ELISA to MMP-9 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, results suggest that doxycycline may have a therapeutic potential to reduce MMP-9 activity in AVM tissues and stabilize blood vessels that are prone to rupture. Our findings may provide a basis for a larger clinical trial to study effects of tetracycline derivatives in preventing AVM hemorrhage.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TH, a corresponding author, participated in all aspects of the study and manuscript preparation.
