Our previous study has shown that IL-1 can induce mast cells to produce proinflammatory cytokines which are involved in atherogenesis. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of epinephrine on IL-1-induced proatherogenic cytokine production from mast cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Two ml of HMC-1 (0.75 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml) were cultured with epinephrine (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-5 </sup>M) in the presence or absence of IL-1&#x003b2; (10 ng/ml) for 24 hrs. HMC-1 cultured alone produced none to trace amounts of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13. IL-1&#x003b2; significantly induced production of these cytokines in HMC-1, while epinephrine alone did not. However, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13 production induced by IL-1&#x003b2; were significantly enhanced by addition of epinephrine. The enhancing effect appears to involve NF-&#x003ba;B and p38 MAPK pathways. Flow cytometry showed the presence of &#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>and &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>adrenoreceptors on resting mast cells. The enhancing effect of proatherogenic cytokine production by epinephrine was down regulated by the &#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>and &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, but not by the &#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>adrenoceptor antagonist, atenolol, suggesting the effect involved &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>adrenoceptors. The enhancing effect of epinephrine on proatherogenic cytokine production was also down regulated by the immunosuppressive drug, dexamethasone.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results not only confirm that an acute phase cytokine, IL-1&#x003b2;, regulates mast cell function, but also show that epinephrine up regulates the IL-1&#x003b2; induction of proatherogenic cytokines in mast cells. These data provide a novel role for epinephrine, a stress hormone, in inflammation and atherogenesis.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Atherogenesis involves the cellular infiltration of several cell types, including monocytes, T lymphocytes, and mast cells. Cytokine secretion by these cells and endothelial cells are contributing factors in the growth and propagation of atherosclerotic plaques as well as the stability and degradation of fibrous caps. Cytokines implicated in atherogenesis include Interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-8, IL-13, and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>IL-1&#x003b2; is secreted mainly by macrophages and virtually by every cell type in the body. IL-1&#x003b2; is produced in response to various stimulants, such as cytokines, bacteria, and viruses, but most interestingly to epinephrine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. IL-1&#x003b2; has a broad range of functions which includes activation of neutrophils, endothelial cells, monocytes, T-cells, and mast cells. It may also induce procoagulant changes in endothelial tissue. IL-6 induces an acute phase response consisting of increased fibrinogen synthesis and thrombocytosis with increased vascular permeability. The detection of IL-6 in the blood of patients suffering from unstable angina suggests that nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B) activation may be occurring at the vascular level in patients with heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. IL-8 is in the CXC family of chemokines and functions to recruit neutrophils to the site of inflammation. IL-13 exerts multiple effects on cell differentiation and function of monocytes/macrophages. It can also suppress the cytotoxic function of monocytes/macrophages and the production of proinflammatory cytokines by these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Mast cells are found preferentially around blood vessels and beneath the epithelium of the skin and mucus membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Traditionally, mast cells are responsible for allergy and asthma pathogenesis. Typically, mast cell activation occurs in response to cross-linkage of the high affinity IgE receptor (Fc&#x003b5;RI) by antigen and IgE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Activation may also occur in response to a range of agents, such as pathogens, cytokines, and even oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). After activation, key mediators secreted by mast cells include preformed mediators like histamine, proteoglycans, proteases, and several cytokines and growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Mast cells have been observed in both aortic atherosclerotic lesions and in coronary arteries. The large numbers of mast cells found in the adventitia of arteries and in the intima are in proportion to the severity of heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The study of the distribution, activation, and phenotype of mast cells in lesions of 250 specimens of human carotid arteries by Jeziorski, <italic>et al.</italic> further supports the role of mast cells in atherogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. They demonstrated significant numbers and focal accumulations of mast cells in association with macrophages and extensive activation/degranulation at all developmental stages of atherosclerotic lesion development. It now appears likely that inflammatory events and mast cells play an important role in atherogenesis as recently reviewed by us [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Stress is known to influence immune function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. An immunoregulatory effect of the sympathetic nervous system in stress has been indicated for some time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Catecholamines, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine, are elevated in stress responses, and mediate vasoconstriction and an increase in blood pressure as a result of increased peripheral vascular resistance. In disorders such as sepsis, cardiovascular disease, or cocaine abuse, catecholamines are elaborated in excess. Sustained increases in circulating catecholamines by infusion of epinephrine or norepinephrine have been shown to cause moderate cardiovascular and metabolic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Catecholamines induce aggravation of aortic and coronary atherosclerosis in monkeys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and play a direct role in atherogenesis and cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Epinephrine and norepinephrine increase the uptake of low density lipoprotein in atheroscelotic plaques in rabbits and rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] as well as enhance proliferation of rat endothelial and smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. It has been reported that norepinephrine increases adherence and chemotaxis of macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Epinephrine also upregulates the surface expression of L-selectin on monocytes <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Most recently, we have reported that nitric oxide production from macrophages induced by LPS is enhanced by catecholamines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Both epinephrine and IL-1 are involved in acute phase responses seen in stress and in coronary artery disease. Studies have shown that norepinephrine can induce IL-1&#x003b2; mRNA in mycocardial tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and that infusion of IL-1&#x003b2; in animal models can induce expression of catecholamines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. These data suggest that, in some conditions, both IL-1&#x003b2; and catecholamines can be delivered to tissues that can then mediate additive or modulatory effects. Moreover, as reviewed by Gidron Y et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] stress in conjunction with the release of catecholamines and proinflammatory cytokines, can potentiate atherogenesis. Hence, studies of the interactions between catecholamines, monokines and inflammatory cell activation are especially relevant. The aim of the study was to determine whether epinephrine affects IL-1&#x003b2; induced proatherogenic cytokine production in mast cells, a phenomenon previously not described. Our results indicated that epinephrine synergized with IL-1&#x003b2; in the production of proatherogenic cytokines, suggesting a potential role for this interaction in inflammatory and atherogenic states.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Epinephrine enhances IL-1&#x003b2;-induced IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13 production in mast cells</title><p>Human mast cell line, HMC-1, was incubated with IL-1&#x003b2; at various concentrations for 24 hours. The cell free supernatants of the cultures were harvested and subjected to IL-6 assay. HMC-1 cultured in medium alone produced trace amounts of IL-6. The IL-6 production from HMC-1 cultures treated with IL-1&#x003b2; was significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner (p &#x0003c; 0.0001) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Since there was no significant difference in the IL-6 production induced by IL-1&#x003b2; at concentrations of 10 and 50 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml of IL-1&#x003b2; has been used to induce cytokine production in HMC-1 for the rest of the experiments. Epinephrine (Epi) alone at a concentration of 10<sup>-3 </sup>M did not induce production of IL-6 in HMC-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). When epinephrine at 10<sup>-3 </sup>to 10<sup>-7 </sup>M concentration was added simultaneously with IL-1&#x003b2; into the cultures, the production of IL-6 was enhanced significantly (p &#x0003c; 0.05) compared with that induced by IL-1&#x003b2; alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Since the physiological concentration of epinephrine in plasma is 0.11 &#x02013; 0.27 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-6 </sup>M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], we decided to use epinephrine at a supramaximal concentration of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-5 </sup>M for the rest of the experiments. In addition to IL-6, the enhancing effect of epinephrine was also observed in the production of IL-8 and IL-13 from IL-1&#x003b2;-induced HMC-1 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>IL-1&#x003b2; induces IL-6 production from HMC-1 cells.

IL-1&#x003b2;-treated HMC-1 showed increased IL-6 mRNA transcription as seen with densitometry, while epinephrine alone appeared to have no effect. When IL-1&#x003b2; and epinephrine were added together to HMC-1, IL-6 mRNA expression increased over IL-1&#x003b2; treatment alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The intensities of the cytokine and house keeping gene (HPRT) bands were measured by densitometry, and the ratio of the cytokine to the house keeping gene was calculated and assigned as the intensity index. The intensity indices for IL-6 were 0.36 for the control, 0.39 for IL-1&#x003b2; alone, 0.33 for epinephrine alone, and 0.54 for IL-1&#x003b2; plus epinephrine. IL-1&#x003b2; activated IL-8 mRNA production but epinephrine had no effect on IL-8 transcripts. IL-1&#x003b2; and epinephrine treatment together further increased IL-8 mRNA production (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The intensity indices for IL-8 were 0.17 for the control, 0.52 for IL-1&#x003b2; alone, 0.20 for epinephrine alone, and 0.64 for IL-1&#x003b2; plus epinephrine. The results with IL-13 expression showed the same pattern. IL-1&#x003b2; was a good inducer of IL-13 transcription while epinephrine alone only minimally induced IL-13 mRNA. The combined stimulus of IL-1&#x003b2; and epinephrine significantly increased IL-13 mRNA production over that seen with each stimulus alone (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Intensity indices for IL-13 were 0.22 for the control, 0.57 for IL-1&#x003b2; alone, 0.20 for epinephrine alone, and 0.64 for IL-1&#x003b2; plus epinephrine. To evaluate further the ability of epinephrine to induce IL-13 transcription at a molecular level, we transiently transfected HMC-1 cells with minimal promoter sequences as described in the materials and methods. IL-1&#x003b2; at 10 ng/ml significantly increased IL-13 promotor activity as detected by luciferase expression (data not shown). Epinephrine did not enhance IL-13 promoter activity suggesting that post-transcriptional mechanisms may be involved in the IL-13 induction. It is likely that epinephrine either prolongs IL-13 mRNA half life and/or enhances IL-13 secretory processes from the mast cell in response to IL-1-stimulation.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>RT-PCR analysis for IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13 in HMC-1 treated with IL-1&#x003b2; and epinephrine.

Acute phase response (APR) proteins have been demonstrated as risk factors for atherosclerotic heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Recent studies also suggest a prominent role for the APR in cerebrovascular disease and brain ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The APR culminates in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;", and IL-1 resulting in the synthesis of several proteins including C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, serum amyloid A protein, and ceruloplasmin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. These cytokines are intimately involved with the stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. These cytokines can also induce transcriptional regulation of complement genes that have been shown to play a role in cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Catecholamines are elaborated in stress responses which mediate vasoconstriction and elevate systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure. Catecholamines induce aggravation of aortic and coronary atherosclerosis in monkeys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and play a direct role in atherogenesis and cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Thus, it is important to understand the interaction between epinephrine and IL-1&#x003b2; with respect to atherogenic cytokine production.</p><p>In this study, IL-1&#x003b2;, an acute phase cytokine, activated mast cells to produce proatherogenic cytokines, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These results confirm our previous report that IL-1&#x003b2; regulates mast cell function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. These results also show that epinephrine significantly up regulated the IL-1&#x003b2; induction of proatherogenic cytokines in mast cells giving new insight into neuronal regulation of the immune system. The gene expression of these proatherogenic cytokines was also increased in IL-1&#x003b2;-induced HMC-1 cells by addition of epinephrine, suggesting that the enhancing effect of proatherogenic cytokine production is a result of increased cytokine gene transcription (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). These data provide a novel role for epinephrine in inflammation and atherogenesis.</p><p>IL-1&#x003b2; signaling probably synergizes with &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoreceptor-mediated signaling pathways in inducing proatherogenic cytokine production. Several reports have shown that the effect of catecholamines on immune function is due to &#x003b2;-adrenoceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Flow cytometry data indicated that HMC-1 cells express both &#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>and &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>adrenoceptors in small amounts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The result showed that the enhancing effect of proatherogenic cytokine production by epinephrine is down regulated by &#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>and &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol, but not by &#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>specific adrenoceptor antagonist, atenolol, further suggesting the enhancing effect involves &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>adrenoceptors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The down regulation by propranolol does not appear to be due to cytotoxicity of the antagonist since there is no difference in viabilities between the propranolol-treated and untreated cell cultures. It was interesting to see that propranolol caused a reduction of production of IL-13 to an amount that was much lower than that treated with IL-1&#x003b2; only (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). It may be that epinephrine-induced enhancement of IL-13 production is more sensitive to the propranolol blocking.</p><p>Activated NF-&#x003ba;B has been demonstrated in atheromatous plaques and has been shown to play a role in atherogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. To study the mechanism of the enhancing effect of epinephrine on proatherogenic cytokine production from IL-1&#x003b2;-induced mast cells, NF-&#x003ba;B and p38 MAPK activations were investigated. Control samples and epinephrine alone samples did not induce NF-&#x003ba;B activation. However, a marked increase in NF-&#x003ba;B activation was observed in samples stimulated with IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-1&#x003b2; plus epinephrine (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). NF-&#x003ba;B activation was seen early at one hour and began to fade by two hours. NF-&#x003ba;B also was not increased by the addition of epinephrine to IL-1&#x003b2; and even seemed to decrease it at both time points suggesting that NF-&#x003ba;B is needed for cytokine induction but not for the enhancing effect. The presence of phosphorylated p38 MAPK was greatly increased in the epinephrine and IL-1&#x003b2; plus epinephrine samples but only minimally activated with IL-1&#x003b2; alone at a 30 minute incubation time point (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). SB203580 blocked the IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-1&#x003b2; plus epinephrine effect on IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13 expression suggesting that p38 plays an important role in signaling from both IL-1&#x003b2; and epinephrine. The double stimulation of p38, early by IL-1&#x003b2; and later by epinephrine, may explain the enhancing effect on the production of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13 in mast cells.</p><p>The enhancing effect of epinephrine on proatherogenic cytokine production was also down regulated by immunosupressants, such as Dex. Dex at the concentration used in this study did not affect the cell viability of the culture, suggesting the down regulation effect of the drugs is not due to toxic effect. Dex also slightly, but not significantly, decreased IL-1&#x003b2;-induced cytokine production in mast cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Taken all together, these results indicate that &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor antagonists and glucocorticoids may have clinical potential in stress-mediated disease and atherogenesis.</p><p>All the signaling pathways induced by IL-1&#x003b2; and epinephrine in mast cells are complex and beyond the scope of this manuscript. However, two important inflammatory pathways, NF-&#x003ba;B and p38 MAPK, have been shown. IL-1&#x003b2; release from immune challenge and epinephrine elevated from stress response can jointly stimulate mast cells to increase IL-6, -8, and -13 production above that which is seen with either stimulus alone. The exact mechanisms are unclear, but we have shown that IL-1&#x003b2; is a strong inducer of NF-&#x003ba;B while epinephrine is a strong inducer of p38 MAPK. Neither NF-&#x003ba;B nor p38 MAPK was activated further by IL-1&#x003b2; plus epinephrine compared to either stimulus alone nor was the promotor activity of IL-13 increased by the double stimulus as seen by luciferase activity of a IL-13 reporter gene construct. These data would suggest that IL-1&#x003b2; is activating IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13 by NF-&#x003ba;B while p38 MAPK activation is enhancing protein production by inducing other transcription factors, stabilizing the gene mRNA, or other forms of post-translational modification. These mechanisms are summarized in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>.</p><fig position="float" id="F10"><label>Figure 10</label><caption><p>Schematic presentation showing the possible route of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13 signaling. Endogenous IL-1&#x003b2; production may occur with immune challenge by cytokines, bacteria, and viruses, and any microtrauma in the body while epinephrine is released in states of stress or sympathetic nervous system activation. The pathways activated by these signals converge on IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13 genes to induce cytokine production that is greater than either signal alone. IL-1&#x003b2; activates the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway which leads to significant amounts of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-13 production. Epinephrine activates the p38 MAPK pathway which may activate other transcription factors or stabilize the IL-6, 8, and 13 mRNA. From our data it is evident that IL-1&#x003b2; and epinephrine do not combine to further activate NF-&#x003ba;B or the promotor activity of the IL-13 gene.

Seven micrograms of nuclear protein were added to 2 ml of binding buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), and 35 fmol of double stranded NF-&#x003ba;B consensus oligonucleotide (5' AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C 3') (Promega, Madison, WI) end labeled with &#x003b3;-P<sup>32 </sup>ATP (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The samples were incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes and run on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel for 2 hours. The gel was then dried on a Gel-Drier (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules CA) and exposed to Kodak X-ray film at -80&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Detection of p38 MAPK by Western blot</title><p>Cells were treated and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris HCL, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton &#x000d7; 100, and 0.1% SDS) to be analyzed for p38 MAPK activation by Western blot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Briefly, 50 &#x003bc;g of sample protein was diluted 1:2 with Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad laboratories, Hercules, CA) and boiled for 10 minutes in a sand bath. The resultant sample was then run in a Bio-Rad Modular Mini Electrophoresis System (Hercules, CA) on a 10% polyacrylamide gel for 1 hour and then transferred to a 0.2 &#x003bc;m nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad laboratories, Hercules, CA) for 1 hour. The blot was then incubated in blocking buffer (1% BSA and 0.1% Tween in PBS) for 1 hour at room temperature with gentle agitation. Rabbit anti-human Phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182) polyclonal antibody (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer and incubated on the blot overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with gentle agitation. After the primary antibody was removed the blot was washed three times for 10 minutes each with agitation in the wash buffer (0.1% Tween in PBS). The blot was then incubated in horse radish peroxidase conjugated mouse anti-rabbit Ig's antibody (human adsorbed, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) diluted 1:5000 in blocking buffer. The blot remained in the secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature. The blot was then washed again and covered with Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL) for 5 minutes. The blot was then exposed to acetate transparency film (Kodak, Rochester, NY) and developed. The same protocol was repeated for total p38 MAPK analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of &#x003b2;-adrenoceptor by flow cytometry</title><p>Resting HMC-1 were centrifuged, washed in PBS at room temperature, and resuspended in 100 &#x003bc;l of PBS. The cells were incubated for 20 minutes with rabbit polyclonal anti &#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>or &#x003b2;<sub>2 </sub>adrenergic receptor antibodies (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA) using normal rabbit serum as a control. The samples were washed with PBS with 0.01% sodium azide and resuspended in 100 ml PBS. FITC labeled goat anti-rabbit Ig's antibody was added to the samples and allowed to bind for 20 minutes. The samples were once again washed with PBS with 0.01% sodium azide and resuspended in 100 &#x003bc;l of PBS. In addition, HMC-1 were pretreated with normal rabbit serum and incubated with FITC labeled goat anti-rabbit Ig's antibody as a control for nonspecific binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Cell suspensions were then gated and analyzed based on fluorescence using a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur 4-color flow cytometer (San Diego, CA) and histograms generated on WinMDI 2.8 software (kindly provided by Joseph Trotter over the internet).</p></sec><sec><title>IL-13 promotor analysis</title><p>HMC-1 were treated with IL-1&#x003b2; (10 ng/ml), epinephrine (10<sup>-5 </sup>M), and IL-1&#x003b2; plus epinephrine to investigate IL-13 promotor activity. Untreated cells were used as a control. Transient transfection assays were performed using a reporter gene construct containing the minimal promoter sequence of IL-13. The promoter sequence (-233 to + 50, relative to the transcription initiation site) of the IL-13 gene was fused to the luciferase coding sequence. Plasmid DNA was obtained with double-cesium chloride purification (BioServe Biotechnologies, Laurel, MD), while SuperFect reagent (Qiagen) was used for transient transfections of HMC-1 cells. Two micrograms of plasmid DNA and 8 &#x003bc;l SuperFect reagent were used for transfection of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>HMC-1 cells. Luciferase expression was monitored by chemiluminescence of cell lysates 24 hrs after transfections using the Enhanced Luciferase Assay Kit (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis of the data</title><p>All experiments were done in triplicate.
