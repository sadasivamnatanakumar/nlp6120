Unique sets of B-cells reside in these compartments, and they have specific functional roles in humoral immune response. MNZ B cells are na&#x000ef;ve cells in a quiescent state and may participate in GC reactions upon proper stimulation. The adult splenic MGZ contains mostly memory B cells and is also known to provide a rapid response to particulate antigens. The GC B-cells proliferate rapidly and undergo selection and affinity maturation. The B-cell maturational process is accompanied by changes in the expression of cell-surface and intracellular proteins and requires signals from the specialized microenvironments.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We performed laser microdissection of the three compartments for gene expression profiling by cDNA microarray. The transcriptional program of the GC was dominated by upregulation of genes associated with proliferation and DNA repair or recombination. The MNZ and MGZ showed increased expression of genes promoting cellular quiescence. The three compartments also revealed distinct repertoires of apoptosis-associated genes, chemokines and chemokine receptors. The MNZ and GC showed upregulation of <italic>CCL20 </italic>and <italic>CCL18 </italic>respectively. The MGZ was characterized by high expression of many chemokines genes e.g. <italic>CXCL12</italic>, <italic>CCL3</italic>, <italic>CCL14 </italic>and IFN-associated genes, consistent with its role in rapid response to infections. A stromal signature was identified including genes associated with macrophages or with synthesis of extracellular matrix and genes that influenced lymphocyte migration and survival. Differentially expressed genes that did not belong to the above categories include the well characterized <italic>BCL6 </italic>and <italic>CD10 </italic>and many others whose function is not known.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Transcriptional profiling of B-cell compartments has identified groups of genes involved in critical molecular and cellular events that affect proliferation, survival migration, and differentiation of the cells. The gene expression study of normal B-cell compartments may additionally contribute to our understanding of the molecular abnormalities of the corresponding lymphoid tumors.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Appropriate T- and B-cell migration and timely interaction with antigen presenting cells (APC) are essential for the development of humoral immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Specialized compartments within lymphoid tissues facilitate these interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Distinct populations of B-cells reside in these microenvironments, and, upon antigen stimulation, cells with appropriate antigen receptors differentiate and migrate among these compartments for a proper immunological reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The initiation of a T-dependent B-cell response results from cognate interaction between a T-helper cell and a B-cell that primes the B-cell into two developmental pathways. An extrafollicular reaction takes place in the T zone and leads to the production of plasma cells with unmutated immunoglobulin (Ig) genes. The other pathway initiates a germinal center (GC) reaction, whereby activated B lymphocytes originating from extrafollicular foci enter the GC and undergo a stringent process of positive selection and affinity maturation. The selected cells differentiate into either memory B-cells or plasma cells with mutated Ig genes. The GC provides the important microenvironment for this crucial B-cell maturational process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>In follicles with developing GCs, the resting B-cells that are not the part of the GC response are pushed outward to form the mantle zone (MNZ) or corona around the GC B-cells. The mantle cell is a pre-GC, immunologically na&#x000ef;ve B-cell that is also the putative cell of origin of mantle cell lymphoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These B-cells express unmutated immunoglobulin genes, sIgD<sup>high</sup>, CD27<sup>- </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and are mostly restricted to the follicular mantle zone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In the human spleen, there is a well defined zone between the follicular B-cells and the red pulp called the marginal zone (MGZ) containing marginal-zone macrophages, granulocytes and dendritic cells that are specialized to capture blood-borne antigens and present them to the resident marginal zone B-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Unlike primary lymphoid follicles in spleen and lymph nodes, which contain mostly mature recirculating B-cells, non-recirculating B-cells are enriched in the splenic MGZ. These cells are specially adapted to respond rapidly to T-independent (TI) antigens and have a lower threshold than recirculating or immature B-cells for activation, proliferation and differentiation into antibody-secreting cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. They may therefore provide the early rapid humoral response prior to the more refined but delayed response from the GC reaction. Most adult human MGZ B-cells have the IgM<sup>high</sup>, IgD<sup>low </sup>and CD27<sup>+ </sup>phenotype, suggesting that this zone contains mainly memory B-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Many previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] have provided important information concerning the biology of the GC. While morphology and immunophenotype are useful in defining the various B-cell compartments of peripheral lymphoid organs, the molecular signals that affect the life span, survival, retention, migration and functions of the cells in these compartments have not been widely investigated.</p><p>We used the Lymphochip cDNA microarray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] to investigate the differences in gene expression profiles in the three different B-cell compartments, the MNZ with mostly na&#x000ef;ve B-cells, the MGZ containing memory B-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and specialized non-recirculating B-cells and the GC with a mixture of highly proliferative centroblasts and more differentiated and non-dividing centrocytes. For this study, we used both tissue compartments isolated by laser capture microdissection (LCM) and na&#x000ef;ve and memory B-cells isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The microdissected samples contained the dominant B-cell population in each compartment as well as other cell populations in the physiological microenvironment, whereas the FACS-sorted cells contained more uniform B-cell subsets. By comparing FACS-sorted cells with the corresponding compartment from LCM, we have identified a stromal cell gene expression signature that may provide insight into stromal/B-cell interaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Isolation of na&#x000ef;ve and memory B-cells and different anatomic B-cell compartments</title><p>GC and MNZ could be readily dissected from tonsillar frozen sections, but MGZ could only be reliably obtained from the spleen (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Immunostaining was not applied on the sections to be microdissected because it was difficult to obtain cells from sections on charged slides and because immunostaining also led to a marked loss of amplifiable RNA from the sections, even when a rapid procedure was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Hence, immunostaining was performed on a consecutive section to guide the dissection. Immunostaining by us and others has shown that the MNZ contained over 90% B-cells, which are the IgD<sup>+ </sup>CD27<sup>-, </sup>similar to FACS-sorted na&#x000ef;ve B-cells. The GC was easily recognizable and generally contained a higher percentage of non B-cells, including T-cells, macrophages and follicular dendritic cells (FDC). The MGZ was obtained from a spleen with a morphologically clearly defined MGZ containing mostly IgM<sup>+ </sup>CD27<sup>+ </sup>B-cells, corresponding to the phenotype of FACS-sorted memory B-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The MGZ also contained scattered T-cells and has been shown by others to contain specialized macrophages and fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The FACS-sorted populations were over 90% pure, according to post-sort immunophenotyping (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Three different B-cell compartments isolated by LCM. </bold>Frozen sections of reactive tonsils or spleens were fixed, and a consecutive section was immunostained for CD3 to guide the dissection.

Cells were captured at the 15-&#x003bc;m with laser set to pulse at 60 mW for 200 ms.

Different hybridizations were correlated through a correlation matrix plot, and replicated hybridizations were shown to be closely related (R &#x02265; 0.85). The plots allowed us to check reproducibility of the microarray assay among different samples of each tissue (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The number of genes showing differential expression between two compartments and the magnitude of difference calculated by t-statistics were further filtered by Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) approach, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. On the Lymphochip, over 20% of the genes are represented by multiple clones, and, generally, several clones of same genes are selected by our analytical algorithm. The differentially expressed genes among the three compartments identified by SAM were grouped according to their major functional attributes and then viewed through Tree View.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Correlation Coefficient Mapping. </bold>Reproducibility of the different hybridization experiments was checked through correlation coefficient mapping programmed in MATLAB.

The results corresponded well with both microarray and semi-quantitative RT-PCR.</p></sec><sec><title>Gene expression characteristics in anatomic B-cell compartments</title><sec><title>Genes controlling cell proliferation and quiescence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>)</title><p>Comparing the gene expression profiles of LCM GC and FACS-sorted GC B-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] revealed that the GC B-cell signature was largely represented in the microdissected GC profile. The GC gene expression profile was dominated by the increased expression of genes associated with proliferation (e.g., <italic>CCNB1</italic>, <italic>PCNA</italic>, <italic>Ki67</italic>), kinetochore association (e.g., <italic>CENPF</italic>, <italic>BUB1 and BUB3</italic>), functional components of mitotic checkpoints (e.g., <italic>CENPE </italic>and <italic>TTK</italic>) and regulators of cell-cycle related events, including centrosome separation/segregation and cytokinesis (e.g. <italic>KNSL5</italic>, <italic>ARK2</italic>), as expected from the known high proliferation rate of centroblasts. GC also highly expressed genes involved in DNA repair (e.g., <italic>RAD54</italic>, <italic>BRCA2</italic>, <italic>RAD51</italic>, <italic>ERCC5 </italic>and <italic>MSH2</italic>), as expected from the frequent physiological double-strand DNA breaks associated with somatic hypermutation and isotype switching. The GC profile also showed increased levels of transcripts involved in DNA replication (e.g., <italic>DNAJ</italic>, <italic>DNA2L</italic>, <italic>DNMT1</italic>, <italic>TOP</italic>, <italic>RFC4 </italic>and <italic>RPA1</italic>) and in transcription and translation (e.g., <italic>EIF2</italic>, <italic>TAF</italic>, <italic>TCF</italic>, <italic>UHRF1</italic>, <italic>UBD </italic>and <italic>UBE2</italic>).</p><p>The low expression of the cyclins <italic>CCNA</italic>, <italic>CCNB1</italic>and <italic>CCNF </italic>and of <italic>CDC2 </italic>(also known as <italic>CDK1</italic>) is consistent with the resting state of the MNZ and MGZ B-cells. Characteristically <italic>CCNA </italic>expression is very low in G<sub>o </sub>phase and begins to increase in early G<sub>1</sub>. For the cell to enter the G2/M phase, an association with CDC2 is required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The transition requires CCNB1 to form a complex with CDC2 and relocate to the nucleus. This nuclear localization is mediated by CCNF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, MNZ and MGZ B-cells may also employ different mechanisms in maintaining quiescence. <italic>Cyclin G2 </italic>(<italic>CCNG2</italic>) was highly expressed in MNZ cells as compared to either GC or MGZ. The function of CCNG2 differs from the conventional cyclins in negatively regulating the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Studies on HeLa cells have showed that DNA damage induces the production of cyclin G2, which then arrests the cell cycle at the G1/S boundary, and this function is independent of p53. Cyclin G2 can directly interact with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and prevent cell cycle progression. The low expression of <italic>CARD11 </italic>in MNZ may also be part of the program in maintaining the quiescent state. CARD11 has been shown to be critical for immune receptor signaling of both T and B-cells through the activation of JNK and NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The increased transcriptional level of CD72 may be involved in maintaining the quiescent state in MNZ B-cells. CD72 contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) in its cytoplasmic domain and functions as a negative regulator of B-cell signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Interestingly, many genes associated with proliferation were expressed at even lower levels in MGZ than in MNZ cells. These cells highly expressed growth inhibitory genes such as <italic>CMRF-35H </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], <italic>CBL-B </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], and <italic>GAS2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], which may contribute to the quiescent state in MGZ B-cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Cell proliferation and quiescence. </bold>Differential gene expression among B-cell compartments. Genes identified in SAM analyses were merged according to functional or operational categories and visualized in Tree View. Color changes within a row indicate expression levels relative to the median of the sample population. Only transcripts differing 2-fold or more in their magnitude than the median or mean of the other two compartments are shown.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2172-5-20-5"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Apoptosis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>)</title><p>The markedly decreased <italic>BCL2 </italic>expression in GC B-cells makes them vulnerable to undergo apoptosis unless rescued by survival signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. An increase in the expression of proapoptotic genes e.g. <italic>BIK</italic>, <italic>FASL </italic>and <italic>PDCD8 </italic>(<italic>AIF</italic>) suggests a further increase in susceptibility to apoptosis in the GC. However, <italic>FAIM </italic>is overexpressed in the GC and may represent a protective mechanism in GC B-cells that have appropriate BCR signaling and CD40L stimulation with resultant upregulation of FAIM and increased resistance to FASL-mediated apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Presumably, GC B-cells with sIg having poor antigen affinity will be ineffective in activating FAIM. In addition, a TNF receptor family member (TNFRSF17/BCMA) which promotes the B-cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] showed increased transcription in the GC. Programmed Cell Death 4 (PDCD4), which functions mainly as an inhibitor of translation by inhibiting the activity of eIF4A helicase, which helps to unwind the 5' end of mRNAs, was markedly repressed in the GC B-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. This suggests that PDCD4 repression facilitates the rapid proliferation of centroblasts, which requires a high rate of protein synthesis. Both MNZ and MGZ had higher expression of <italic>BCL2</italic>, but have different profiles of other apoptosis/survival genes that may represent specific adaptation of these cells to their unique physiological states and microenvironment. The expression of <italic>BNIP3</italic>, encoding a proapoptotic protein of the BCL2 family[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], is markedly down regulated in MGZ cells, perhaps providing additional protection against apoptosis in memory B-cells. On the other hand, <italic>TCL1 </italic>was upregulated in MNZ only and may have an antiapoptotic role in that population.</p><p>There was increased expression of <italic>Suppressor of Death Domains (SODD) </italic>in MGZ cells, suggesting a complex regulation of signaling through the TNFR superfamily. SODD is associated with TNFR1 in vivo, maintaining the receptor in an inactive monomeric state. The release of SODD from TNFR1 permits the recruitment of proteins such as TRADD and TRAF2 to the activated TNFR1 signaling complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that TNF-induced activation of NF-&#x003ba;B is accelerated in SODD-deficient cells. The high expression of <italic>SODD </italic>may be a major mechanism to dampen TNFR1 signaling in MGZ B-cells in the resting state. The higher expression of <italic>CARD11 </italic>in MGZ may have a pro-survival function, but it may also have a role in MGZ organization. It has been shown that loss of CARD11 in mice resulted in the complete loss of CD5<sup>+ </sup>peritoneal cells and reduced number of IgD <sup>high </sup>IgM <sup>low </sup>mature splenic B-cells, indicating its role in B-cell development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Two closely related genes, <italic>NM23-H1 </italic>and <italic>NM23-H2</italic>, which share an amino acid identity of 88%, were highly expressed in MGZ. NM23 H1 is a granzyme A-activated DNase (GAAD) that is inhibited by SET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].

Our microarray data revealed that <italic>CCL18</italic>, encoding a chemokine secreted by immature dendritic cells (DC), is specifically upregulated in the GC compartment.

The higher expression of <italic>CCL18 </italic>may be especially important during the onset of a GC reaction, the time point to recruit antigen primed pre-GC B-cells, which then interact with GC DC to initiate and maintain the GC reaction. The GC compartment showed increased expression of <italic>CXCL10 </italic>(<italic>IP-10</italic>). which has pleiotropic effects, including stimulation of monocytes and T cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>The GC also showed increased transcriptional level of genes that may suppress or control inflammatory responses; e.g., SOCS1 limits cellular response to IFN&#x003b3;, IL-2 and IL-6[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Macrophage inhibiting cytokine 1 (<italic>MIC1</italic>, also known as <italic>PLAB</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], is only expressed by activated macrophages, but not by resting macrophages. Its higher expression in the GC may reflect the presence of moderate numbers of macrophages and its possible role in suppressing the inflammatory response in the GC.</p><p>Increased expression of the chemokine <italic>CCL20 </italic>was observed in MNZ cells. Human na&#x000ef;ve and memory B-cells express the cognate receptor for CCL20, CC-chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The high expression of <italic>CCL20 </italic>may play a vital role in na&#x000ef;ve B-cell migration and localization in the MNZ. The chemokine gene <italic>CXCL12 </italic>(also know as stromal cell-derived factor 1, <italic>SDF1</italic>) is highly expressed in MGZ cells. The receptor for CXCL12 is CXCR4, which is present on CD34<sup>+ </sup>cells, myeloid cells, CD4<sup>+ </sup>T cells, B-cells, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and dendritic cells. In the bone marrow, stromal cells secrete CXCL12, which is involved in the emigration of hematopoietic precursors to the marrow during embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In peripheral lymphoid organs CXCL12 may be involved in the migration of B-cells and possibly other cells, such as T cells and plasma cells, to the MGZ. <italic>CCL14 </italic>(also known as <italic>HCC1</italic>) and <italic>CCL3 </italic>(also known as <italic>MIP-I&#x003b1;</italic>) were more highly expressed in the MGZ. CCL14 can activate human monocytes via receptors that also recognize CCL3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. CCL3 is a proinflammatory cytokine important in the clearance of viral infections and the stimulation of the innate immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Thus, the expression of this gene may be important in innate immunity in the MGZ of the spleen. <italic>CXCL13 </italic>and <italic>CCL5 </italic>were upregulated in both microdissected MGZ and MNZ compared with the FACS-sorted B-cell populations. Previous studies have established an important role for CXCL13 (BLC) in the development of Peyer's patches (PP) and many peripheral lymph nodes. It also controls B-cell migration and thus the organization of B-cell areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. CCL5 (RANTES), a stromal related chemokine, elaborated by activated T, NK and macrophages has been shown to interact with CD44 to activate the MAPK pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. It is possible that CCL5, under appropriate conditions, contributes to cellular activation that may be particularly relevant to MGZ B-cells, in which rapid response on recognition of antigen stress signal is important.</p><p>A number of IFN-induced genes (<italic>AIM2, IFNGR1</italic>, and <italic>IFNAR -1 </italic>and -<italic>2</italic>) were also preferentially expressed and may reflect the unique function of the MGZ to provide the first rapid response to particulate or T cell-independent antigens. The MGZ also showed increased expression of many members of G protein pathways consistent with more active chemotaxis, cell motility and secretory functions. In addition, MGZ cells showed higher expression of <italic>IL-7R&#x003b1;</italic>, consistent with the role of the IL-7R in MGZ organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].

Thus, an insight into the gene expression profile of the stromal elements can be obtained by comparing the expression profile of FACS-sorted and microdissected cells. We found a set of genes that likely represent the stromal signature. <italic>Osteonectin (SPARC)</italic>, upregulated in LCM samples, encodes a matrix-associated protein that elicits changes in cell shape, inhibits cell-cycle progression, and influences the synthesis of extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. It regulates endothelial barrier function through F-actin-dependent changes in cell shape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Two members of the Maf family (<italic>MafB</italic>, and <italic>c-Maf</italic>) were also part of the stromal signature. The Maf family of genes encode bZip nuclear transcription factors and play an important role in morphogenesis and cellular differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. These genes are expressed in a variety of organs, including the spleen, in agreement with our finding. The MGZ expressed elevated levels of <italic>ICAM1 </italic>and <italic>VCAM1</italic>. MGZ B cells express the integrin <italic>LFA1 </italic>which binds to its ligands ICAM1 and VCAM1, and this interaction may control the localization of these B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] in this compartment. Our results also showed elevated expression of <italic>VCAM1</italic>, <italic>ITGAL (LFA-1) </italic>and <italic>ITGA6 </italic>in the MNZ, suggesting a role for these adhesion molecules in mantle cell localization as well. The kruppel-like transcription factor <italic>BCL11a </italic>(also called Evi9), which is essential for normal B-cell lymphopoiesis, was upregulated in LCM cells only. Interestingly, bone marrow from <italic>BCL11a</italic>-/- mouse can induce thymic lymphoma in wild type mice.

A number of genes were clearly upregulated in the MNZ or MGZ but their functional significance is largely unknown. Some of these would be interesting targets for further investigation. Among the genes encoding surface molecules, <italic>CD59 </italic>was highly expressed in the GC. CD59 antigen is a small protein that inhibits complement-mediated pore formation or lysis by preventing the formation of membrane-embedded C9 multimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. It is likely that the over expression of CD59 in GC can prevent complement-mediated damage to FDCs with entrapped immune complex. CD10 and CD38 are well established markers of GC B-cell and over expression of the corresponding mRNA in the GC is expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>].

They also showed different molecular microenvironments that allow the different B-cell populations to differentiate and function properly. GC B-cells have a high proliferation gene signature, whereas MNZ and MGZ cells are characterized by signals that help to maintain the quiescent state. Genes involved in the apoptosis pathway are differentially expressed in the three B-cell compartments, reflecting different adaptations for survival in different B-cell populations. Expression of different chemokines, their receptors, and stromal molecules have been detected. Many of these have been implicated in the establishment of the normal lymphoid architecture in peripheral lymphoid organs and in attracting distinct immune-cell populations to specific lymphoid areas. The expression of unique sets of genes may also reflect the functional adaptation of cells in a specific location, such as genes involved in DNA repair in the GC and genes that are active in innate immune response to infection in the MGZ. Gene expression profiling of B-cell compartments has allowed us to obtain a global survey of the molecular signals that are functionally important in B-cell subpopulations as well as the respective microenvironments. One of the major challenges is to delineate the functions of the uncharacterized genes that are unique to each of the compartments. Another challenge is to exploit these normal transcriptional profiles to further our understanding of the normal immune response and the derangements resulting in the corresponding lymphoid tumors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Laser capture microdissection (LCM)</title><p>Tissue blocks of tonsils and spleens were snap frozen in O.C.T immediately after surgery.

Only genes with at least two values out of the triplicate experiments showing similar behavior were included for analysis. The expression data for each gene from an individual compartment was median/mean centered with weighted variance across the two or three replicates showing similar behavior. The initial data reduction was performed using the two-tailed student t-test to compare the differences in gene expression levels between individual compartments. Genes differentially expressed between the two compartments with a p-value of less than 0.05 were selected for further analysis using the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) approach, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].
