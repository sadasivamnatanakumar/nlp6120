The frequency of mutational events varies widely within the genome, and specific sites harboring increased frequency of mutation are now defined as 'hot spots' of mutation. The human <italic>ras </italic>protooncogene family contains three such hot spots &#x02013; codons 12, 13, and 61. Factors contributing to these and other hot spots of mutation are still largely unknown, despite much investigation, but now appear to have several different contributions, such as type of DNA damage, genomic location, surrounding sequence, cell cycle position, efficiency of the optimal DNA repair pathway, and involvement of alternate repair and other cellular pathways.</p><p>DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is a repair system that corrects mispaired nucleotides and insertion/deletion loops (IDLs), resulting from replication, recombination, or repair errors. Consequences of defects in this DNA repair pathway are evidenced by microsatellite instability (MSI), elevated mutation frequency throughout the genome, enhanced recombination events, as well as tolerance to cytotoxic effects of alkylating agents as evidenced by decreased apoptosis. Deficient MMR is, in turn, associated with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), as well as other types of sporadic tumors in humans and animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Although the contribution of MMR to highly mutable genomic sites other than microsatellite sequences is largely unknown, several specific genetic mutations involved in neoplastic progression, including <italic>ras-</italic>activating mutations, have been reported as frequent occurrences in HNPCC and other MSI tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>DNA MMR is conserved amongst highly divergent species, reflecting the essential role of this DNA repair process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The MMR system in eukaryotes is more complex and has different mismatch-specific repair efficiencies than that of <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Several human homologs of bacterial MutS and MutL proteins have now been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The primary human homologs for MutS that play instrumental roles in MMR include hMSH2, hMSH6, and hMSH3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The hMutS&#x003b1; heterodimer (hMSH2 and hMSH6) has been demonstrated to recognize and bind DNA mispairs and short IDLs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The hMutS&#x003b2; heterodimer (hMSH2 and hMSH3) preferentially recognizes and binds IDLs of up to 12 nucleotides. Human cells lacking hMSH2 protein expression also lack its cognate partners, hMSH3 and hMSH6 (due to decreased stability). This lack is associated with defective MMR, microsatellite instability, and is associated with a high percentage of HNPCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. MutL homologs that are most relevant to human MMR are hMLH1 and hPMS2, which form the hMutL&#x003b1; heterodimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Similar to the observed instability of individual MutS homologs, lack of hMLH1 protein expression results in the lack of hPMS2 protein, which in turn results in microsatellite instability, defective MMR, and is also associated with a high percentage of HNPCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The MutL&#x003b1; heterodimer is thought to act as a molecular matchmaker between the MutS&#x003b1;-DNA complex and downstream enzyme activities responsible for subsequent identification, excision, and replacement of the incorrect base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Biochemical interactions and genetic studies have further implicated proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), exonuclease I (EXO1), replication protein A (RPA), replication factor C (RFC), and DNA polymerase &#x003b4; as active participants in the MMR pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Recently, the differential requirement of specific proteins associated with MMR have been identified for both 3'-nick directed and 5'-nick directed MMR by the use of an <italic>in vitro </italic>model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].</p><p>We have previously demonstrated that the efficiency of correct mismatch repair within the cell can differ significantly, depending on exact type of mismatch, site-specific location, phase of cell cycle, or cell type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Within this report, we have focused on a more precise understanding of the differences between MMR protein interactions with a G:A (least repaired) or G:T (best repaired) mismatch located at H-<italic>ras </italic>codon 12 to better understand molecular events leading to activating mutations at this site. Our current results indicate that initial recognition and subsequent binding for repair signaling by hMutS&#x003b1; may be two separably measurable steps in the MMR pathway that can significantly affect downstream cellular events.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Specificity of hMutS&#x003b1; protein binding to DNA mismatches at H-ras codon 12</title><p>To determine that the binding complex recognizing mismatches at codon 12 of H-<italic>ras </italic>in HCT116 + Ch.3 nuclear extract is composed of hMuts&#x003b1;, DNA binding reactions were conducted using [<sup>32</sup>P]-G:T oligos incubated with nuclear extracts from these MMR proficient cells. In confirmation of hMutS&#x003b1; binding to a G:T mismatch at this oncogenic site, the hMutS&#x003b1; :DNA complex was efficiently interrupted by goat anti-hMSH6 and with rabbit anti-hMSH2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, lanes 3 and 5), but not by BSA, nonspecific goat IgG, or nonspecific rabbit IgG (lanes 1, 2, and 4, respectively). As further evidence of specific hMuts&#x003b1;:DNA mismatch binding, addition of 1.5 mM ATP completely disrupted the gel shifted band (results not shown) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Thus, MMR protein binding to a G:T mismatch located at H-<italic>ras </italic>codon 12 within the nuclear environment appears to be primarily, if not exclusively, hMutS&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of hMutS&#x003b1; binding 'avidity' to a G:T mismatch located at H-ras codon 12 within MMR competent and deficient nuclear extracts</title><p>The HCT116 cell line completely lacks both 3' and 5' nick-directed MMR, putatively due to lack of hMLH1 expression, although these cells normally express hMSH2 and hMSH6. To determine if hMutS&#x003b1; recognition and binding of a mismatch at the H-<italic>ras </italic>codon 12 hot spot might undergo alteration within HCT116 cells, in conjunction with the lack of hMutL&#x003b1;, binding competition experiments were performed. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> is a comparison of the amount, or 'avidity', of hMutS&#x003b1; binding affinity within MMR proficient (HCT116 + Ch. 3) and within MMR deficient (HCT116) nuclear extracts. These gel shifts demonstrate virtually identical mismatch specific binding avidity of hMutS&#x003b1; to [<sup>32</sup>P]-G:T-oligo. As well, 50X molar excess of unlabeled G:T-oligo, which does not completely inhibit hMutS&#x003b1; gel shift of the radioactively labeled mismatch, demonstrates a similar degree of competitive inhibition of mismatch specific binding in both MMR proficient and MMR deficient nuclear extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, lanes 3 and 5). These results provide strong evidence that there is no discernable difference in hMutS&#x003b1; binding avidity to a G:T mismatch at H-<italic>ras </italic>codon 12, despite that HCT116 + Ch. 3 is MMR proficient and HCT116 lacks expression of hMutL&#x003b1; and is MMR deficient.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of competitive inhibition of hMutS&#x003b1; binding avidity to G:T versus G:A mispairs at H-ras codon 12</title><p>We have previously determined that the G:A mismatch at H-<italic>ras </italic>codon 12 is accurately repaired back to G:C much less frequently than G:T [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In addition, we have previously demonstrated that recognition and binding of this poorly repaired mismatch is also very weak within HeLa nuclear extracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We therefore asked if competitive inhibition by several different concentrations of these mismatches would reveal more specific mechanisms of these intriguing differences at this same location. Firstly, using increasing concentrations of unlabeled G:T oligo as a competitor for [<sup>32</sup>P]-G:T-oligo, we observe the expected highly competitive inhibition of the radioactive G:T mismatch gel shift band in the presence of as little as 25X cold G:T-oligo (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>; compare cold G:T fold increase lanes "0" up through "100"). In comparison, the radioactive G:T-oligo gel shift band is much less competitively inhibited by increasing concentrations of cold G:A oligo (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>; compare cold G:A fold increase lanes "0" up through "100"), further confirming the observed preference of hMutS&#x003b1; for a G:T mismatch as compared to a G:A mismatch at the H-<italic>ras </italic>codon 12 hot spot of mutation. Comparison of the densitometric band intensities reveal that even 25X cold G:T oligo can successfully decrease hMutS&#x003b1; binding to radioactive G:T by 80%, but that 25X cold G:A decreases hMutS&#x003b1; binding to radioactive G:T by only 10%.</p><p>An alternate approach to more precisely define the extent of this phenomenon was to measure competitive inhibition of radioactively labeled G:A-oligo (rather than of the avidly bound [<sup>32</sup>P]-G:T-oligo) by incubation with unlabeled G:A-oligo, to determine if equal <italic>ratios </italic>of competitive binding might occur for G:T and G:A, despite the very different avidities of hMutS&#x003b1; for each mismatch. This would provide an indication of equal recognition of each type of mismatch by hMutS&#x003b1;, despite unequal binding avidity for these two mismatches. For these experiments, it was necessary to extend incubation periods from 30 min. to 2.5 hr, as sufficient concentrations of gel shifted bands can be detected with the G:A oligo only after extended incubation (unpublished observations). As expected, binding of hMutS&#x003b1; to [<sup>32</sup>P]-G:A-oligo is approximately 100 fold weaker in intensity than for [<sup>32</sup>P]-G:T-oligo after the extended incubation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>; compare "Intensity" of lanes 1 and 3 on densitometric graph). However, 100X molar excess of cold G:A-oligo competitively inhibits MMR protein binding to [<sup>32</sup>P]-G:A-oligo by 89%, which is similar to the same concentration of cold G:T-oligo competitive inhibition of MMR protein binding to [<sup>32</sup>P]-G:T-oligo (97%), as determined by comparison of the densitometric intensity of each band. All of the above experiments have been repeated with similar results.</p></sec><sec><title>MMR at H-ras codon 12 hot spot of mutation</title><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> contains the results of a MMR assay designed to score nick-directed MMR as correct, incorrect or unrepaired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Positive control experiments demonstrate that MMR at the H-<italic>ras </italic>codon 12 sequence within the pUC19 vector is nick-directed, yielding a high degree of correct repair by MMR proficient <italic>E. coli </italic>(DH5&#x003b1;); G:T &#x02192; G:C = 95%, G:A &#x02192; G:C = 78%, in agreement with our previously published results using a different plasmid vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Additionally, inserting the same H-<italic>ras </italic>69 mer into a pUC18 vector to determine effects of reverse orientation of the oligo and 'nicked' strand resulted in an almost identical frequency of correct repair at codon 12; G:T &#x02192; G:C = 100%, G:A &#x02192; G:C = 78%. These results confirm that the mismatch is recognized and repaired by nick-directed bacterial MMR and that there is no strand bias for MMR during high copy number bacterial replication of this plasmid. Background repair after direct transformation into NR9161 E. coli (MMR deficient) was consistently between 41&#x02013;44% for both mismatches (data not shown), and is favorably comparable to an average of 50 &#x02013; 60% background repair efficiency by this and other strains of MMR deficient E. <italic>coli </italic>(personal communication with Roel Schaaper).</p><p>Results within Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> were determined by incubating plasmids containing a G:T or G:A mismatch at the H-<italic>ras </italic>codon 12 middle base pair location containing a 5' nick on the "T" or "A" strand (as described in methods) with MMR proficient (HCT116 + Ch. 3) or MMR deficient (HCT116) nuclear extracts. Efficiency of correct, incorrect, and total (correct + incorrect) MMR for each mismatch was subsequently calculated (as described in methods) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Surprisingly, <italic>total repair </italic>of the G:A mismatch (30%; G:A &#x02192; G:C + T:A) was almost twice as high as for G:T (18.2%; G:T &#x02192; G:C + A:T). This phenomenon was consistently observed within the several different experiments required to obtain the total results depicted in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, and was statistically significant (p &#x0003c; 0.05). In direct contrast, <italic>correct </italic>(nick-directed) repair of G:A &#x02192; G:C (60%) was significantly low when compared to <italic>correct </italic>(nick-directed) repair of G:T &#x02192; G:C (96%) (p &#x0003c; 0.005). Inadvertent nicks in the "G" (correct) strand of the H-<italic>ras </italic>69 mer or pUC plasmid during preparation could not have contributed to the increased total, or increased incorrect repair (G:A &#x02192; T:A) results for the G:A mismatch because the efficiency of incorrect repair would then be similar for both the G:T and the G:A mismatch. Instead, MMR results within Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> were found to be consistently different for the two mismatches, and are the compiled results of several different mismatch-containing plasmid preparations and subsequent MMR assays. In addition, MMR proficient <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli </italic>nick-directed repair results are consistently high, for both mismatch-containing plasmid preparation subsequently used for each nuclear extract MMR assay (data not shown). As well, MMR deficient E. <italic>coli </italic>repair ratios (correct to incorrect) are 1:1 after transformation of unmethylated plasmids (prepared by replication in GM2929; <italic>E. coli dam</italic><sup>-</sup><italic>dcm</italic><sup>-</sup>). In combination, all of the above control experiments demonstrate a lack of any significant unintentional misrepair events on either strand of DNA, for either site-specific mismatch plasmid preparation. Therefore, the results within Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> suggest that increased total repair (correct + incorrect) combined with increased incorrect repair of G:A, as compared to the decreased total repair and increased correct MMR repair of G:T, may result in increased mutational events when a G:A mismatch occurs at this oncogenic site. Somewhat surprisingly, MMR deficient nuclear extracts did not repair either mismatch at codon 12 above background, indicating a complete lack of alternate DNA repair activity that can correct either mismatch at this oncogenic site. Therefore these results indicate that the observed repair efficiencies in MMR proficient nuclear extracts are due solely to MMR activity, rather than to a combination of MMR and other DNA repair pathways. Alternatively, it is possible that the methods used for nuclear extract preparation or the <italic>in vitro </italic>MMR assay might cause an artifactual decrease in the activity of other DNA repair pathways.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion and conclusions</title><p>Previous investigations of ours have revealed significantly decreased nick-directed G:A &#x02192; G:C repair at codon 12 of H-<italic>ras</italic>, as compared to G:T &#x02192; G:C repair at this location [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Decreased MMR of G:A has also been observed within different sequences by other investigators, although molecular mechanisms for these differences remain obscure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The current investigation was undertaken to determine key steps differentiating G:T and G:A repair pathways at the H-<italic>ras </italic>oncogenic hot spot within the nuclear environment. Our results suggest that, firstly, the MMR pathway is the primary, if not the only, DNA repair pathway that can recognize and is subsequently responsible for the repair of both mismatches at this oncogenic location within the cell. Secondly, although 'recognition' of either G:T or G:A by hMutS&#x003b1; is likely equal, and is essential for initiation of MMR, the avidity &#x02013; or strength &#x02013; of hMutS&#x003b1; binding to either mismatch is not equal, and may play a significant role in the decision of whether to activate nick-directed <italic>correct </italic>MMR, or the activation of an alternate response pathway. In support of this concept, and in correlation with weak hMutS&#x003b1; binding to G:A, we have observed significantly decreased nick-directed (correct) MMR of G:A &#x02192; G:C (60%), as compared to nick-directed MMR of G:T &#x02192; G:C (96%). We have however, consistently measured almost twice the efficiency of <italic>total </italic>repair of G:A (to either G:C or T:A) as compared to total G:T repair (to G:C or A:T) at this oncogenic site. This phenomenon appears to be due to increased non nick-directed <italic>incorrect </italic>repair of G:A &#x02192; T:A (rather than to replication without repair, which results in a mixture of G:C and T:A).</p><p>This raises the possibility that (a) initial recognition of a mismatch is essential but separable from (b) differential binding of MMR proteins to specific mismatches, which in turn is directly correlated either with nick-directed <italic>correct </italic>MMR, or with alternate events other than nick-directed MMR. In support of this concept, Wang, et. al. has recently demonstrated by atomic force microscopy that <italic>E. coli </italic>MutS-DNA complexes exist in two conformations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The initial recognition of a mismatch by MutS results in a localized kink in the DNA conformation and is termed the initial recognition complex (IRC). The second step is required for MMR and is a further conformational change in which the localized kink in the DNA becomes unbent. This is called the ultimate recognition complex (URC) and may be the conformation required for ATP activation and subsequent MMR activity. It is also possible that either differential binding kinetics (not measurable by gel shift), or very low avidity of binding or a different molecular binding mechanism (undetectable by gel shift) may contribute to subsequent cellular events specific to the G:A mismatch. These possibilities are currently being investigated. An additional hypothesis has been proposed by Junop, et. al., placing <italic>E. coli </italic>MutS in the role of 'authorizing' different repair events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Also, it is now well documented that while hMutS&#x003b1; recognizes DNA damage other than mismatches, the MMR pathway does not appear to play a direct role in the repair of these damaged bases, but rather is associated with initiation of cell cycle and/or apoptotic events and therefore is described as a "sensor of genetic damage" within this context. The molecular mechanisms contributing to the various cellular activities associated with the well documented hMutS&#x003b1; recognition and differential binding to different DNA structures is not yet clear. Although there does not appear to be a consistent physical size or shape of hMutS&#x003b1; recognizable structures that trigger different pathways of cellular activity, DNA sequence context does appear to play a role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> is the model summarizing our hypothesis. This concept is compatible with our current set of experimental data, and with the recently described two-step conformational alteration of the <italic>E. coli </italic>MutS-DNA recognition complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Briefly, hMutS&#x003b1; appears to equally recognize both G:T and G:A mismatches at the codon 12 hot spot of mutation, but binds more avidly to G:T, or the "URC" conformation. The stronger, or alternate conformational, binding of hMutS&#x003b1; to G:T results in increased accuracy of MMR, but may decrease overall repair efficiency. The less avidly bound G:A mismatch, or the "IRC" conformation, is repaired with increased total efficiency as compared to G:T, but accuracy is sacrificed.</p><p>These results agree with, and build upon our previous experimental results, and also agree with the presence of specific mutations predominantly found in human tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. It has now been demonstrated by several different investigators that, although any base pair other than G:C at the H-<italic>ras </italic>codon 12 location is activating, the majority of human tumors containing mutations at this site are G:C &#x02192; T:A transversions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Our observed increased <italic>overall </italic>MMR of G:A, combined with a high ratio of <italic>incorrect </italic>MMR of G:A &#x02192; T:A at this oncogenic location correlates well with the predominant G<bold>G</bold>C &#x02192; G<bold>T</bold>C (Gly &#x02192; Val) <italic>ras-</italic>activating mutation found in a high percentage of human tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Thus the demonstration of a significant increase in the frequency of both total repair and incorrect repair of the G:A mismatch at the H-<italic>ras </italic>codon 12 oncogenic hot spot of mutation, combined with a complete lack of rescue by other DNA repair pathways, is biologically relevant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Nuclear extracts, oligonucleotides, and site-specific mismatched plasmids</title><p>Human colorectal carcinoma cell lines HCT116 and HCT116 + Ch. 3 were cultured in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37&#x000b0;C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.
