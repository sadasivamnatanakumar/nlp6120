The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent proteinases involved in the degradation of ECM macromolecules. The MMPs and their natural inhibitors (TIMPs) have been implicated in tumour growth, invasion and metastasis. In this study we provide evidence that the in vitro cultured cell line from desmoid tumour accumulates more collagen fibres in the ECM than healthy fibroblasts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We investigated collagen accumulation by <sup>3</sup>H-thymidine incorporation, MMP expression by substrate gel zymography and TIMP expression by Western blot analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Desmoid fibroblasts showed a reduction in MMP activity and an increase of type I and III collagen and TIMPs compared to normal fibroblasts.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The increase in collagen in desmoid fibroblasts was due to inhibited collagen degradation (reduction of MMP activity) rather than to increased collagen synthesis. Adding toremifene, an anti-estrogen triphenylethylene derivate, to desmoid fibroblasts reduced collagen accumulation by decreasing mRNA expression and increasing collagen degradation.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Desmoid tumours, which are frequently observed in Gardner's syndrome, are rare, slow-growing, histologically benign tumours caused by autosomal dominant gene mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. They are, however, locally aggressive, compress surrounding structures and show frequent recurrences after surgical removal. Desmoid cells are characterized by abundant deposition of organic macromolecules in the extracellular matrix (ECM), by enhanced transforming growth factor &#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>(TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>) gene expression and increased protein secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Cell proliferation, angiogenesis and the accumulation of ECM macromolecules are all facilitated by tumour cell production of TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. All components of ECM are degraded by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of zinc-dependent neutral endopeptidases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Two types of MMPs are required for dissolution of interstitial collagen: collagenases and gelatinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Collagenase-1 (MMP-1), collagenase-2 (MMP-8) and collagenase-3 (MMP-13) are the principal secreted neutral proteinases that initiate degradation of native fibrillar collagens of type I, II, III and V. They all cleave fibrillar collagens at a specific site, resulting in the generation of N-terminal 3/4 and C-terminal 1/4 fragments, which are further degraded by gelatinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Gelatinase-A (MMP-2) is expressed by several types of cells, especially fibroblasts, whereas gelatinase-B (MMP-9) is restricted to epithelial cells. MMP-2 and MMP-9 are thought to play major roles in the final degradation of fibrillar collagens after first cleavage by collagenases and denaturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. MMP-2 also cleaves native type I collagen to N-terminal 3/4 and C-terminal 1/4 fragments which are identical to those generated by collagenases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Several different tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs; TIMP-1 to TIMP-4) have been identified as the major natural inhibitors of MMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 inhibit the activity of most MMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Expression of TIMP-1 is up-regulated at the transcription level by various growth factors such as TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>, whereas TIMP-2 is largely expressed constitutively by cultured cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Our previous studies showed desmoid fibroblasts enhanced deposition of organic macromolecules in the ECM and TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Even if desmoid cells do not have estrogen receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], adding toremifene, an antiestrogenic triphenylethylene derivate, decreased TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>production and ECM macromolecule accumulation through a mechanism of action that still remains unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The present study investigates the rule of MMPs and TIMPs in the desmoid tumour and describes, for the first time, the effects of toremifene on MMPs and TIMPs. The results provided evidence that toremifene reduced ECM accumulation by decreasing collagen synthesis and increasing collagen degradation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Antiestrogen</title><p>Toremifene (4-chloro-1,2-diphenyl-1-{4-[2-(N,N-dimethylamino) ethoxy] phenyl}-1-butene) citrate was purchased from Farmos (Farmos Group Ltd, Finland).</p></sec><sec><title>Cell cultures</title><p>Fibroblast cell lines were obtained from patients with Gardner's syndrome and were provided by NIGMS (Camden, N.J.). The GMO 6965 cell line was obtained from phenotypically healthy fibroblasts, and the GMO 6888 cell line was obtained from desmoid fibroblasts. All cell lines were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (GIBCO-Invitrogen, Basel, Switzerland), 2% non-essential amino acids (GIBCO), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 U/ml streptomycin in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere at 37&#x000b0;C. Confluent cultures were obtained after 48 h of in vitro maintenance. The cells were cultured for 12 h in MEM. The medium was then discarded to avoid serum factor contamination.

For Northern blot analysis equal amounts of total RNA (20 &#x003bc;g) were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel containing 0,66 M formaldehyde and transferred on to nylon filters (Hybond N, Amersham). Before blotting, the gel was rinsed in water for 15 min at room temperature and then in 20X SSC (1 X SSC is 0.15 M sodium chloride, 0.015 M sodium citrate, pH 7) for 10 min. Blots were pre-hybridised in 20 ml of a cocktail containing 1 mM EDTA pH 8, 0.25 M Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4 </sub>pH 7.2 and 7% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for 4 h at 65&#x000b0;C. Probes were labelled with [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P] dCTP (3000 Ci/mM) by random priming (Amersham RPN 1601). Hybridisation was performed at 65&#x000b0;C overnight using 10<sup>6</sup>cpm/ml probe in the same buffer used for pre-hybridisation. After hybridisation, the nylon membrane was washed twice in 1 mM EDTA pH 8, 20 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4 </sub>pH 7.2 and 5% SDS at 65&#x000b0;C (5 min each) and then washed twice with 1 mM EDTA pH 8, 20 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4 </sub>pH 7.2 and 1% SDS at 65&#x000b0;C (5 min each).

The latent procollagenase was activated with trypsin (10 &#x003bc;g/ml) and then the trypsin was inactivated with soybean trypsin inhibitor (100 &#x003bc;g/ml). Acetic acid soluble type I collagen (25 &#x003bc;l of a solution 2 mg/ml) from bovine skin was incubated with the activated collagenase solution for 24 h. The products of the collagen digestion were separated by electrophoresis using 6% acrylamide gel containing SDS. The gels were stained with 0.25% Coomassie brilliant blue G-250 (50% methanol, 10% acetic acid), destained appropriately (40% methanol, 10% acetic acid) and fixed (5% methanol, 7.5% acetic acid).

In one set of samples the proenzymatic forms were activated using 2 mM aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA) for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C. Samples were lyophilised and resuspended in Tris-HCl 0.4 M pH 6.8, SDS 5%, 20% glycerol and 0.03% bromophenol blue. Gels were loaded with 8 &#x003bc;g protein per sample or with 2 &#x003bc;g trypsin and run under Laemmli conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. After electrophoresis, gels were washed twice in 200 ml of 2.5% Triton X-100 (30 min each) under constant mechanical stirring and incubated in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.02% Brij-35 and 200 mM NaCl at 37&#x000b0;C for 24 h.

Granted that the number of intact viable cells was high in all the experimental conditions, desmoid fibroblasts had the highest number of cells/culture and the lowest percentage of dead cells (0.0014%). Treatment of desmoid fibroblasts with toremifene enhanced the percentage of dead cells (0.011%) which, nevertheless, remained lower than in normal fibroblasts (0.025%.).</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of toremifene on collagen synthesis</title><p>Collagen synthesis was evaluated after 3, 24 and 48 h of in vitro maintenance in the presence of <sup>3</sup>H-proline (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). No significant difference was observed after 3 hours culture. After 24 and 48 h culture collagen production was significantly higher in desmoid than in normal fibroblasts, in both the cellular and extracellular compartments. The increase was 1.4 fold in the cells and 1.8 fold in the medium after 24 h; 1.3 fold in the cells and 1.8 fold in the medium after 48 h. Adding toremifene significantly decreased collagen synthesis at 24 and at 48 h. The reduction was greater after 48 h (42% in the cells and 38% in the medium). In a second set of experiments desmoid fibroblasts were cultured for 48 h with or without toremifene. The radiolabelled precursor was added for 48 h, in the last 24 h and in the last 3 h (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Treatment with toremifene had an inhibitory effect at all times. The decrease in total collagen (cells + media) in desmoid fibroblasts treated with toremifene was 28% in the presence of <sup>3</sup>H-proline for 48 h, 46% and 52% respectively in the presence of <sup>3</sup>H-proline in the last 24 or 3 h of in vitro maintenance (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Procollagen &#x003b1;<sub>1 </sub>(I) mRNA expression</title><p>Northern blots were performed to analyse procollagen &#x003b1;<sub>1 </sub>(I) mRNA level in normal and desmoid fibroblasts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Densitometric tracing of the autoradiograms quantified collagen secretion. Desmoid fibroblasts secreted much more type I (1.6 fold) and III (2.2 fold) collagen than normal cells. Toremifene reduced type I and III collagen by 31% and 18% respectively in desmoid fibroblasts.</p></sec><sec><title>Collagenase activity</title><p>Collagenases, from ammonium sulphate-precipitated proteins of media of normal fibroblasts, desmoid fibroblasts and desmoid fibroblasts treated with toremifene, were incubated with soluble collagen and the digested products were evaluated by gel electrophoresis. Collagenases in the medium of normal fibroblasts digested more &#x003b1;<sub>1 </sub>and &#x003b1;<sub>2 </sub>chains of type I collagen into their corresponding 3/4 and 1/4 fragments than the collagenase in desmoid fibroblasts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). When band staining intensity was quantified by densitometry, the abundance of the 3/4 and 1/4 products of collagenase digestion was significantly greater in normal than in desmoid fibroblasts. Adding toremifene to desmoid fibroblasts markedly increased collagenase activity as shown by the increased amount of 3/4 and 1/4 fragments of &#x003b1;<sub>1 </sub>and &#x003b1;<sub>2 </sub>chains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Collagen and gelatin zymography</title><p>Collagen and gelatin zymograms dosed the enzymatic activity of collagenases and gelatinases. Collagen zymogram, reported in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> (panel A and B), showed the samples produced a band of 52 kDa corresponding to MMP-1. Densitometric analysis of the counts, assuming the value of normal fibroblasts as 100%, demonstrated 2.3 fold increase in the 52 kDa collagenase activity in desmoid fibroblasts. When desmoid fibroblasts were treated with toremifene, the level of collagenase activity in the media was only minimally affected. No bands were present in trypsin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, panel A, line C), which can degrade gelatin but not collagen, confirming that collagen has been degraded in panel A. The gelatin zymogram (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, panel C and D) showed two bands, one of 92 kDa corresponding to MMP-9, the other of 66 kDa corresponding to MMP-2. Desmoid fibroblasts produced the same amount of MMP-9, and larger (about 2 fold) amounts of MMP-2, than normal fibroblasts Adding toremifene to desmoid fibroblasts increased only MMP-2 activity by about 1.32 fold. To verify whether the bands detected in the collagen and gelatin zymography were due only to MMPs, two control gels were washed and incubated in buffers containing 10 mM EDTA. No bands were detected after this treatment, which indicated that the bands obtained in collagen and gelatin zymographies were entirely due to MMP activity. Toremifene addition to desmoid cells was accompanied by no changes in gelatinase activity. One set of samples in collagen and gelatin zymograms was treated with APMA to activate the proenzymes. Activation of the proenzymatic form had no significant effects on collagenase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, panel B), but enhanced gelatinase activity in desmoid fibroblasts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, panel D).</p></sec><sec><title>Western-blot analysis of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9</title><p>The presence of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9 in the media of normal fibroblasts, desmoid fibroblasts and desmoid fibroblasts plus toremifene was evaluated by Western-blot analysis using specific monoclonal antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Western blot analysis of MMP-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, panel A) showed that the amount of the protein was higher in desmoid (2 fold) and in desmoid than in normal fibroblasts (2 fold). Toremifene exhibited no significant increase of MMP-1 in desmoid cells (about 2.2 fold). MMP-2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, panel B) showed two bands, the first due to the proenzymatic form (72 kDa) and the second to the active form (66 kDa). MMP-2 was significantly increased in desmoid fibroblasts (2.2 fold) and even more in desmoid fibroblasts plus toremifene (3.2 fold) compared with normal fibroblasts.

The regulation of extracellular matrix dynamics is clearly complicated, involving a balance between the deposition of structural components such as collagen and their degradation by MMPs, i.e. collagenases and gelatinases. MMP activity is itself regulated by a variety of mechanisms, including a requirement for enzyme modification to elicit maximal enzymatic activity and the activity of specific TIMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. There is now evidence that desmoid cells undergo dramatic clinical response to toremifene, implying the drug has a direct effect upon fibroblasts. Our previous studies showed that toremifene significantly inhibited TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>activity which was six fold higher in desmoid than in normal fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. As desmoid tumour is also associated with abnormal collagen production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], in the present study we examined the rate of collagen synthesis and degradation in the presence or absence of toremifene. In our experimental conditions, type I and III collagen accumulation in the intra- and extra-cellular compartments showed no differences after 3 h of in vitro maintenance, but increased significantly more after 24 and 48 h in desmoid fibroblasts than in normal fibroblasts. No increase in collagen after 3 hours suggests its accumulation in desmoid fibroblasts is due to inhibition of degradation rather than to increased synthesis. The results are confirmed by procollagen &#x003b1;<sub>1 </sub>(I) gene expression, which showed mRNA levels were only lower in desmoid cells treated with toremifene. Normal and desmoid fibroblasts expressed different amounts of MMPs. Several studies suggest that MMPs are over-expressed in malignant tumour progression and facilitate both local tumour invasion and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Different MMPs may play distinct roles at different stages of tumour development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. They may form a network, in which a single MMP is crucial for the cleavage of certain native or partially degraded matrix components and for the activation of other latent MMPs. MMP-1 plays a pivotal role in cancer progression and poor prognosis in colon-rectal, oesophageal and gastric cancer has been correlated with high MMP-1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Nishiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] showed MMP-1 is expressed more strongly in the cancer front of invasion. MMP-2 is increased in cancer tissue and its over-expression is correlated with tumour-related basement membrane degradation and vascular invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Therefore inhibition of the expression or activity of only one MMP could potentially reduce peritumoural proteolytic activity and tumour invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In this study we investigated the metalloproteinases most involved in type I collagen degradation, i.e. MMP-1 (collagenase-1), MMP-2 (gelatinase-A) and MMP-9 (gelatinase-B) and their natural inhibitors TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Moreover TIMP-2 is 10-fold more potent than TIMP-1 against MMP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] which is involved either in the final degradation of native collagen or in the initial degradation cleaving native type I collagen to 3/4 and 1/4 fragments identical to those generated by MMP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Using Western blot we showed no differences in MMP-9 production, while MMP-1 and MMP-2 were higher in desmoid than in normal fibroblasts. Collagen and gelatin zymograms, in which the proteolytic enzymes were separated from TIMPs before the assay, proved the activities of collagenase MMP-1 and gelatinase MMP-2, as dosed in conditioned media, were higher in desmoid than in normal fibroblasts. However, collagenase activity, in the presence of TIMPs, was reduced in desmoid compared to normal fibroblasts as shown by the lower amount of 3/4 and 1/4 fragments of fibrillar collagen in desmoid cells. Together these results indicated the higher MMP-1 and MMP-2 activity in desmoid cells was masked by a 7-fold increase in TIMP-1 and a 3-fold increase in TIMP-2. TIMP-1 is a potent inhibitor of apoptosis in many cells types, its up-regulation protects the cells against apoptotic stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]; hence, greater number of viable cells in desmoid tumour.</p><p>Upregulation in both inhibitors of MMPs may explain why the Desmoid tumour is characterised by an abundant deposition of ECM macromolecules and is neither malignant nor invasive. Toremifene addition to desmoid fibroblasts reduced the accumulation of collagen fibres but its mechanism of action remains unclear. Toremifene increased MMP-1 and MMP-2 activity by 8% and 25% respectively and decreased TIMP-1 by 18%. Despite these modest effects type I collagen degradation in 3/4 and 1/4 fragments increased almost 4-fold.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our previous studies showed that TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>was 6-fold higher in desmoid than in normal fibroblasts and that toremifene significantly reduced TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>activity and TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>membrane-receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. So the effects of toremifene on MMPs and TIMPs could be linked to its effects on TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>because the growth factor enhances organic macromolecule accumulation in the ECM via a reduction in MMP-1 and MMP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and an increase in TIMP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], so favouring tumour mass growth through an inhibition of ECM macromolecule degradation. In the light of these data the reduction of organic macromolecules in the ECM in the presence of toremifene can be ascribed to its inhibition not only of collagen synthesis, but also of TGF&#x003b2;<sub>1 </sub>activity. Further studies on the regulation of MMP activities may clarify the role of toremifene on ECM degradation and provide important clues about pathogenesis of desmoid tumour.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CB carried out collagen synthesis, collagenase activity and drafted the manuscript.</p><p>CL and GB participated in the design of the study and carried out Northern blot analysis.</p><p>LM and GG carried out RT-PCR, zimography and oestrogen receptor assay.</p><p>AB and LC carried out Western blot analysis and performed the statistical analysis.</p><p>PL conceived of the study, and participated in its design and coordination.</p><p>All authors read and approved the final manuscript.</p></sec><sec><title>Pre-publication history</title><p>The pre-publication history for this paper can be accessed here:</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/5/22/prepub"/></p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. G.A.
