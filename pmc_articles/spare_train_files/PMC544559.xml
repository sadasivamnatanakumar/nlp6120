Multifactorial mechanisms have been implicated in this intrinsically resistant phenotype, including deregulation of cell death pathways. In this regard, the p53 protein has a well established role in the control of tumor cell response to DNA damaging agents; however, the relationship between p53-driven genes and drug sensitivity remains controversial. The present study investigates the role of the p53/p21 system in the response of human colon carcinoma cells to treatment with the cytotoxic agent doxorubicin (DOX) and the possibility to modify the therapeutic index of DOX by modulation of p53 and/or p21 protein levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The relationship between p53 and p21 protein levels and the cytotoxic effect of DOX was investigated, by MTT assay and western blot analysis, in HCT116 (p53-positive) and HT29 (p53-negative) colon cancer cells. We then assessed the effects of DOX in two isogenic cell lines derived from HCT116 by abrogating the expression and/or function of p53 and p21 (HCT116-E6 and HCT116 p21-/-, respectively). Finally, we evaluated the effect of pre-treatment with the piperidine nitroxide Tempol (TPL), an agent that was reported to induce p21 expression irrespective of p53 status, on the cytotoxicity of DOX in the four cell lines. Comparisons of IC50 values and apoptotic cell percentages were performed by ANOVA and Bonferroni's test for independent samples. C.I. calculations were performed by the combination Index method.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Our results indicate that, in the colon carcinoma cell lines tested, sensitivity to DOX is associated with p21 upregulation upon drug exposure, and DOX cytotoxicity is potentiated by pre-treatment with TPL, but only in those cell lines in which p21 can be upregulated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>p21 induction may significantly contribute to the response of colon adenocarcinomas cells to DOX treatment; and small molecules that can exploit p53-independent pathways for p21 induction, such as TPL, may find a place in chemotherapeutic protocols for the clinical management of colorectal cancer, where p53 function is often lost, due to genetic or epigenetic defects or to post-transcriptional inactivating mechanisms.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related mortality in Western countries, with about 1 million new cases every year diagnosed world-wide and 500,000 patients dying from the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Of the patients, 30% have advanced disease at presentation, either locally or at distant sites; in this setting, chemotherapy remains the only viable therapeutic option. However, even this option is severely hindered by the inherent resistance of metastatic colon cancer to many currently used anticancer agents. A variety of mechanisms by which cancer cells resist chemotherapy have been described, including enhanced export of drugs from cancer cells and alterations in drug metabolism and/or in drug-target interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In addition, the response of cancer cells to genotoxic therapies may be critically impaired by defects in the response mechanisms to DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] or in cell cycle regulatory pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Over the past decade, induction of apoptosis has emerged as a major event in tumor cell response to cytotoxic agents (for a recent review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]). This view, although recently challenged by some Authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], has attracted considerable attention on deregulation of cell death pathways as a key determinant of drug resistance.</p><p>Two separable, although extensively cross-talking, pathways leading to apoptosis have been characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The <italic>extrinsic pathway </italic>is initiated by ligation of transmembrane receptors to activate membrane proximal "activator" caspases, which in turn cleave and activate downstream "effector" caspases. The <italic>intrinsic pathway </italic>requires disruption of the mitochondrial membrane and the release of mitochondrial proteins, two events that are regulated by the opposing actions of pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members. "Intrinsic stresses", such as those produced by DNA-damaging agents, activate the intrinsic apoptotic pathway; the multifunctional transcription factor p53 is thought to be part of a "fast track" connection between nuclear DNA damage and the intrinsic pathway machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. <italic>p53 </italic>regulates multiple responses to genotoxic stress by transcriptional activation or repression of a number of genes encoding proteins involved in cell cycle control (p21<sup>WAF1/Cip1</sup>), DNA repair (gadd45), and apoptosis (e.g. Bax, Bcl2 and survivin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Mutations in <italic>p53 </italic>and in the p53 pathway can produce multidrug resistance <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and reintroduction of wildtype <italic>p53 </italic>into <italic>p53 </italic>null tumor cells can re-establish chemosensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. <italic>p53 </italic>status is not a universal predictor of treatment response, in part because not all drugs absolutely require p53 for their apoptotic function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and in some settings, p53 loss can enhance drug-induced apoptotic cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Still, loss of p53 function correlates with multidrug resistance in many tumor types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and the observation that this is a common defect in human tumors has spurred an active search for strategies aimed at directly activating cell death pathways downstream of p53. In this scenario, the role played by the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is particularly intriguing, as this protein can be activated by both p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms and can assume pro- or anti-apoptotic functions, depending on the cellular context (for a review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]).</p><p>The present research focuses on the role of p21 in tumor cell response to treatment with cytotoxic agents, and on the possibility to improve the therapeutic index of such agents by modulating p21 status by p53-dependent and independent pathways. The following issues have been addressed: (a) analysis of the relationship between p21 status and sensitivity to treatment with the cytotoxic anticancer agent doxorubicin (DOX) in p53-positive and -negative colon cancer cell lines; (b) design of treatment strategies based on the use of small molecules able to modulate p21 status; for the present study we have used a low molecular weight, stable nitroxide radical, 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6,tetramethylpiperidne-<italic>N</italic>-oxyl (also known as Tempol, TPL; figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) that was shown to exert an antiproliferative effect against different cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and to increase p21 levels in a p53-null human leukemic cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Our data indicate that p21 modulation may significantly affect cell response to DOX treatment in the colon cancer cell lines tested.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Standard chemicals, including 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylipiperidine-<italic>N</italic>-oxyl (Tempol, TPL) and cell culture reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich srl.

In the absence of drug treatment, it is possible to observe that HT29 cells show higher p53 but lower p21 protein levels, as compared with the HCT116 cell line.

A current paradigm regarding cancer chemotherapy indicates disabling of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway as a key factor in the response of tumor cells to anticancer drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Therefore, strategies aiming at re-establishing the cell's capability to activate a cell death program are an area of active research. The present study was performed in order to define the role of the p53/p21 pathway in the response of colorectal carcinoma cells to DOX, a cytotoxic agent that is typically devoid of effects in this tumor type. The results obtained in our cytotoxicity studies indicate that in the cell lines examined <italic>p53 </italic>status is not unequivocally related to the response to DOX: in fact, while <italic>p53</italic>-deficient cells (HT-29, HCT116-E6) are indeed less responsive than the <italic>p53/wt </italic>parental HCT116 cell line, the highest resistance index was obtained for HCT116 p21-/- cells, harboring two wildtype <italic>p53 </italic>alleles. As expected, treatment with DOX leads to p53 upregulation in the cell lines expressing wildtype p53; this effect has been thoroughly documented in colon cancer cells as well as in tumor cell lines derived from other tissues, and has been attributed to phosphorylation and subsequent stabilization of p53, possibly through activation of DNA-dependent protein kinase or ATM (ataxia-teleangectasia mutated) kinase (see e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]). In HCT116 cells, p21 expression parallels p53 activation; however, data obtained in HT29 and HCT116-E6 cells clearly indicate the existence of p53-independent pathways for p21 induction, that have been extensively characterized (for a review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]) and can be activated to variable extents (HCT116 E6 &#x0003e; HT29) upon exposure to DOX. Interestingly, the extent of the cytotoxic effects observed in the small panel of colon cell lines tested rather seems to parallel the cells' ability to upregulate p21 (HCT116 &#x0003e; HCT116-E6 &#x0003e; HT29 &#x0003e; HCT116 p21-/-). This result is somewhat unexpected: in fact, whereas the function of p21 in cell growth arrest following DNA damage has been established for a long time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], the role played by this protein in the ultimate fate of tumor cells exposed to cytotoxic agents is far from clear-cut [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In a number of studies, p21 has actually been reported to protect tumor cells against cell death induced by enforced p53 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] or by low doses of cytotoxic agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. However, in other experimental settings, p53-dependent or -independent induction of p21 expression seems to be a prerequisite for apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and to sensitize tumor cells to the action of different agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The putative mechanisms by which p21 might actually induce apoptosis have recently been reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], but still await full elucidation.</p><p>Interestingly, the situation outlined by our results does not seem to conform to either view: in fact, while induction of p21 in p53-proficient and -deficient cell lines is associated with increased response to drug treatment, this was not accompanied by a parallel increase in apoptotic cells, as no significant differences in apoptosis were observed between HCT116 cells and the 14-fold resistant HCT-116 p21-/- cell line (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). This suggests that modes of cell death other than apoptosis may operate in tumor cells following exposure to DOX, or, more generally, to DNA-damaging agents, a concept that is beginning to be proposed by a number of Authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]; of note, recent experimental evidence indicates p21 as one of the major determinants of terminal growth arrest induced by cytotoxic agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Therefore, although issues related to terminal growth arrest and senescence have not been specifically addressed in the present study, the possibility that these phenomena might play a role linking cell death to the observed increases in p21 levels should not be disregarded.</p><p>The hypothesis that the cytotoxic response of the tumor cell lines tested in the present study may depend on p21 induction is further corroborated by data obtained following pre-treatment with the piperidine nitroxide TPL. The choice of this compound was dictated by previous findings indicating that TPL induces cell death in a number of tumor cell lines irrespective of their <italic>p53 </italic>status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and that it increases p21 levels in <italic>p53</italic>-null cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The results of the present study show that TPL affects the four colon cell lines to similar extents, thus confirming that its growth inhibitory effect is independent of p53 function. HCT-116 p21-/- cells are actually slightly less responsive than the other cell lines [even though the difference does not attain statistical significance), which suggests the possibility that the effects of TPL are due in part to its ability to increase p21 levels. Interestingly, the nitroxide also induces p21 expression even in p53-deficient cell lines; this observation suggests that TPL can activate p53-independent pathways for p21 induction, as already noted following exposure of HT29 and HCT116 E6 cells to DOX. Moreover, activation of such pathways by TPL appears to sensitize tumor cells to the action of DOX: in fact, synergistic potentiation of DOX cytotoxicity is achieved by TPL in those cell lines where p21 expression can be induced, but only additive effects between TPL and DOX are observed in HCT116 p21-/-, where p21 expression is constitutively absent.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, the results of the present study strongly suggest that 1) p21 induction may significantly contribute to the response of colon adenocarcinoma cells to DOX treatment; and 2) small molecules that can exploit p53-independent pathways for p21 induction, such as TPL, may find a place in chemotherapeutic protocols for the clinical management of colorectal cancer, where p53 function is often lost, due to genetic or epigenetic defects or to post-transcriptional inactivating mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing
