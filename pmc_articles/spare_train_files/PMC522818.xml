The mechanisms underlying this discrepancy between the humoral and cellular immune responses in NPC are still unknown, but might be related to an imbalance in immunoregulatory interleukin production. In this report, we investigated the ability of peripheral (PBL) and tumor- infiltrating (TIL) lymphocytes of undifferentiated NPC patients to produce in vitro three interleukins (IL-2, IL-6, IL-10) and three immunoglobulin isotypes (IgM, IgG, IgA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Lymphocytes from 17 patients and 17 controls were cultured in the presence of Pokeweed mitogen (PWM) for 12 days and their culture supernatants were tested for interleukins and immunoglobulins by specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA).

In addition, NPC patients show a specific pattern of humoral responses against EBV antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Viral proteins known to be expressed in NPC tumor cells are the EBV-encoded nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1) and the latent membrane proteins LMP-1 in 35 to 65% of cases, and LMP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The latent membrane proteins have been shown to serve as targets for EBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) from normal seropositive individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Recently, CD8 positive EBV-specific cytotoxic T cell clones were isolated from the peripheral blood and tumors of NPC patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The majority of the isolated CTL clones are directed towards the most immunogenic EBNA3 proteins which are not expressed in NPC tumor cells. No EBV-specific CTL activity is detectable by the standard chromium release assay in NPC patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and the activity of any CTLs that would be present in such patients appears to be somehow suppressed. This lack of cytotoxic activity is in sharp contrast with the strong anti-EBV humoral immune response seen in patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The discrepancy between these two types of immune responses in NPC is still unexplained. It has been hypothesized that some viral gene products might have the capacity to influence cytokine production in such a way as to inhibit specific CTL activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Interestingly, the product of the EBV BCRF1 open reading frame has been found to display extensive homology with human interleukin 10 [IL-10 ; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]]. Like its human counterpart, this viral product designated vIL-10, exerts immunosuppressive functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. It is postulated that IL-10 production in malignant tumors may facilitate their escape from immune surveillance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The expression of IL-10 in NPC has been controversial. While it has been reported that IL-10 is not expressed by NPC cells as detected by RNA in situ hybridisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], some reports using immunohistochemical and molecular techniques showed the expression of this cytokine by epithelial NPC tumor cells and TIL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These authors suggested IL-10 as a possible evasion mechanism against the host antiviral system. Such a mechanism would explain the lack of detection of EBV specific cytotoxic activity in NPC patients at both peripheral and intratumoral levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Indeed, IL-10 is known to inhibit cell-mediated immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. IL-10 is also known for upregulating the B cell response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and therefore, this putative mechanism is in accordance with the strong EBV-specific humoral immune response seen in NPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Other interleukins such as IL-2 and IL-6 may also appear to be involved in this discrepancy between humoral and cellular immune responses due to their central regulatory effects on T or B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>In this report, we investigated the ability of both peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and TIL of undifferentiated NPC patients to express three interleukins (IL-2, IL-6, IL-10) and three immunoglobulin isotypes (IgM, IgG, IgA) following pokeweed mitogen (PWM) stimulation in vitro.</p><p>The data obtained indicated some significant differences between NPC patients and controls in interleukin and immunoglobulin production.

However, NPC patients show a strong EBV-specific humoral immune response, and elevated titers of anti-EBV antibodies directed against viral antigens are observed in their sera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The mechanisms underlying this discrepancy between humoral and cellular immune responses in NPC patients are still unknown. It was postulated that interleukin 10 production in malignant tumors would facilitate their escape from immune surveillance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The expression of IL-10 in NPC has been controversial. While some authors have reported that NPC tumor cells do not express IL-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], others observed IL-10 expression in epithelial NPC tumor cells and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. They suggested such IL-10 expression as a possible mechanism for NPC tumors and EBV to escape local cellular immune attack. Indeed, IL-10 is a pleiotropic factor known for its suppressive effects on cell-mediated immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In sharp contrast to these inhibitory effects, IL-10 also has a potent stimulatory effect on the humoral immune response, inducing B lymphocyte differentiation and immunoglobulin secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Therefore, IL-10 hyperproduction alone or in association with changes in other cytokines might lead to an imbalance between humoral and cellular immune responses similar to that seen in NPC.</p><p>The expression of cytokines such as IL-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and IL-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] in NPC has been studied mainly on tumor biopsies using immunohistochemical and molecular techniques. To the best of our knowledge, only one study on the ability of NPC patients'lymphocytes to produce cytokines in culture has been reported and it was limited to IL-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>In this report, we investigated the ability of both peripheral blood and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes of 17 undifferentiated NPC patients to produce cytokines following mitogenic stimulation in culture. Since immunoglobulin isotypes are determined by cytokine patterns, we also looked for possible correlations between measured cytokine levels and immunoglobulin isotypes produced. PWM was chosen to stimulate the lymphocyte cultures because it is known to activate both T and B lymphocytes in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In addition, the ability of PWM to stimulate cytokine production by Tcells is similar to that of PHA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. This allowed us to study the responses of both T and B cells simultaneously in each lymphocyte culture.</p><p>The data obtained indicate that the highest levels of IL-2 were produced by TIL cultures followed by patients'PBL. This is in line with a report by Lakhdar et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] showing a higher IL-2 production by PHA-stimulated PBL of NPC patients than by controls. Such high IL-2 levels are expected to favor a strong cytotoxic response since IL-2 is needed for CTL stimulation and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and they are not consistent with the known lack of detectable CTL activity.</p><p>IL-10, a representative of the Th2 pattern of cytokines, is generally considered immunosuppressive. It inhibits IL-6 secretion by activated macrophages but not by Th2 lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In the present work, IL-10 was overproduced by patients'lymphocyte cultures whereas their IL-6 levels were similar to controls, showing no signs of inhibition by IL-10. This points to Th2 lymphocytes rather than activated macrophages as the main source of IL-6 in this system. The increased ability of patients lymphocytes to produce IL-10 is compatible with the lack of CTL activity.</p><p>Cultures of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes secreted significantly higher amounts of IgM and IgG than the PBL of either patients or controls in good agreement with the increased levels of IL-2 and IL-10, since these cytokines are involved in B cell activation and enhance immunoglobulin synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. No significant correlations between cytokine production and IgA secretion were found, in line with the preferential enhancing effect of IL-2 and IL-10 on IgM and IgG synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>In an attempt to see whether the observed differences in cytokine and immunoglobulin production between patients and controls or between PBL and TIL of patients could be due to differences in the composition of individual lymphocyte preparations, we performed an immunophenotypic analysis of each lymphocyte preparation. As shown in the results, the only significant changes in the proportions of lymphocyte subsets between patients and controls were observed in the CD8 subpopulation which showed an increase in patients PBL and TIL. On the other hand, the CD4 subset showed a significant decrease in TIL. Such differences in lymphocyte subpopulations are not expected to produce the changes in cytokine and immunoglobulin production observed here, since CD4 lymphocytes are well known for being the main source of IL-2 and IL-10, and for their ability to stimulate immunoglobulin synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Recently, CD4+ lymphocyte populations have been shown to be more heterogeneous and complex than previously thought [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and new subsets of T regulatory cells (Tr) with immunosuppressive activities have been identified. Tr cells have been suggested to play a key role in the evasion from immune-mediated clearance of microorganisms and tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. It has also been reported that IL-10-producing Tr1 cells dominate the immune response to LMP1 in EBV seropositive subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Since LMP1 is expressed in NPC tumors, it would be tempting to speculate that the increase in IL-10 production by TIL would correspond to an increase in Tr1 cells in the corresponding NPC tumors. In this respect, Hodgkin lymphoma infiltrating lymphocytes have been shown to contain large populations of both Tr1 and CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and it would be interesting to see whether a similar situation occurs in NPC.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our data point to the possibility of an imbalance in immunoregulatory interleukin production in NPC patients. Their lymphocytes, especially those infiltrating the tumors, showed in particular a high propensity to produce IL-10 following mitogenic stimulation in vitro. Overproduction of this pleiotropic cytokine may lead to a discrepancy between humoral and cellular immune responses similar to that seen in NPC. The relevance of the present observations to the in vivo situation is not yet established and warrants further investigations.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LFJ designed and carried out the experimental work, performed the statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript.
