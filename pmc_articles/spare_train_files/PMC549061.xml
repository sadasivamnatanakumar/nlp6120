In most organisms, telomeric DNA consists of a simple, repeated sequence with a G-rich strand running 5' to 3' towards the chromosome end, and terminates with a short, single-stranded 3' overhang (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). The length of the duplex repeated region varies, from 20 base-pairs (bp) in hypotrichous ciliated protozoa to around 300 bp in yeast and several kilobases (kb) in mammalian cells. These DNA repeats recruit telomeric proteins to form the telosome, a structure that resists nucleolytic degradation and prevents chromosome ends from eliciting recombination and end-joining pathways for repairing double-strand DNA breaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Telomeres are also essential for the complete replication of chromosomes, because conventional DNA polymerases do not copy the extreme ends of linear DNA molecules. In the absence of a mechanism to compensate for this 'end-replication problem', progressive telomere shortening leads to replicative senescence, which in yeast is characterized by chromosome instability and low cell viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Replicative senescence in mammals is characterized by growth arrest and altered gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The end-replication problem is managed in most eukaryotes by the enzyme telomerase, which adds telomeric DNA sequences to the 3' end of chromosomes through the action of its catalytic subunit and RNA template (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]). DNA polymerase then forms duplex DNA by synthesizing the complementary C-rich strand of the telomere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In fission yeast, the catalytic subunit of telomerase is encoded by the gene <italic>trt1</italic><sup>+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>In some cases, cells can endure the loss of telomerase and give rise to a population of survivors. In the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, survivors maintain long, heterogeneous telomeres on linear chromosomes using a <italic>RAD52</italic>-dependent homologous-recombination pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Global gene-expression profiles of budding yeast lacking telomerase revealed the induction of a DNA damage response when telomeres were short and a sustained stress response in survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Human alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) cells are cancerous cells lacking detectable telomerase activity that maintain long, heterogeneous telomeres using what is believed to be a strand invasion mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. <italic>S. pombe </italic>cells without telomerase cease dividing after about 120 generations, and can give rise to a subpopulation of survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Interestingly, these survivors have either circular chromosomes or linear chromosomes with long, heterogeneous amplified telomeres (presumably maintained through recombination) that resemble their budding yeast and human ALT-cell counterparts. While survivors with circular chromosomes arise more frequently, those with linear chromosomes grow faster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Circular chromosomes in <italic>S. pombe </italic>are believed to form as a result of the genomic instability due to loss of telomeres, which normally prevent end-joining and suppress recombination. Interchromosomal fusions yield unstable dicentric chromosomes, while intrachromosomal fusions produce circular chromosomes. <italic>S. pombe</italic>, with only three chromosomes, is more likely than other organisms with larger numbers of chromosomes to successfully form exclusively intrachromosomal fusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. <italic>S. pombe </italic>strains with circular chromosomes also result after concurrent deletion of <italic>rad3</italic><sup>+ </sup>and <italic>tel1</italic><sup>+</sup>, two genes with sequence similarity to human <italic>ATM </italic>(ataxia telangiectasia mutated) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Although <italic>S. pombe </italic>survivors with linear chromosomes grow remarkably well and have a morphology similar to wild-type cells, survivors with circular chromosomes display obvious growth defects such as slower growth rates and larger sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Survivors with circular chromosomes presumably cope with impaired DNA segregation, and perhaps DNA breakage and rearrangement. We hypothesized that cells would show altered expression of genes necessary for coping with the loss of telomerase and concomitant changes in chromosome structure. In this study, we determined the <italic>S. pombe </italic>global gene-expression response to loss of <italic>trt1</italic><sup>+ </sup>to investigate changes in expression of genes during senescence, and to compare survivors with circular or linear chromosomes. We report that survivors with circular chromosomes maintain an extended stress response not observed in survivors with linear chromosomes. Furthermore, we present evidence for regulation of a telomeric gene by the RNAi machinery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Wild-type reference strains</title><p>Wild-type isogenic reference strains WT 3 and WT 5 were used to determine relative gene-expression changes in <italic>trt1</italic><sup>- </sup>samples. Before averaging the expression values from the two reference strains, the similarity of their expression profiles was assessed. The dye ratios measured by microarray for each strain were plotted against each other (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). All genes had expression values that varied less than twofold between the two samples, indicating that the samples were highly similar. The wild-type values used in this paper are thus the average expression values of strains WT 3 and WT 5.</p><p>To learn whether changes in gene expression would result from subjecting cells to the continuous growth program for 15 days, gene-expression values from strain WT 5 on day 1 of the growth curve were compared with those of the same strain harvested on day 15 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). Only three genes (SPBC354.08c, <italic>atp8</italic><sup>+ </sup>and <italic>cox1</italic><sup>+</sup>) changed their expression values by more than twofold, and they were only slightly greater; thus, the vast majority of genes do not have altered expression as a result of long-term growth in culture, provided that expression is measured while the cells are in early log phase (see Materials and methods). These three genes also had expression changes of more than twofold in one or more conditions measured for <italic>trt1</italic><sup>- </sup>cells, but given their variable expression in wild-type cells, these changes were most probably unrelated to the absence of telomerase.</p></sec><sec><title>Watching cells pass through crisis and characterizing survivors</title><p>Diploid <italic>S. pombe </italic>cells that were heterozygous for <italic>trt1</italic><sup>+ </sup>and able to maintain full-length telomeres were sporulated, and the resulting <italic>trt1</italic><sup>+ </sup>and <italic>trt1</italic><sup>- </sup>cells propagated through a 15-day growth curve (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). Cells lacking telomerase gave rise to survivors after day 8 concomitant with heterogeneous amplified telomeric repeats and telomere-associated sequence (TAS) (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b-d</xref>), indicative of linear chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. By day 15, the culture was dominated by faster-growing cells with linear chromosomes. The linear structure of these chromosomes was confirmed by their ability to enter a pulsed-field gel (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>, lane g), and the existence of terminal chromosome fragments C, I, L and M after digestion of chromosomes with <italic>Not</italic>I (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a-d</xref>, lane e) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Cells passing through crisis (days 7 and 9) also had weak hybridization signals for the C+M and I+L fragments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d</xref>, lanes c-d), suggesting a mix of cells with either linear or circular chromosomes, or perhaps cells containing both linear and circular chromosomes. The inability to detect intact chromosomal DNA at day 7 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>, lane e) may have resulted from the presence of cells with circularized chromosomes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d</xref>, lane c) that do not enter pulsed-field gels.</p><p>Strains C1 and C5 had circular chromosomes as evidenced by lack of telomeric repeats (data not shown), lack of TAS2 sequence (data not shown), the inability of chromosomes to enter a pulsed-field gel (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>, lanes b-c), the lack of terminal chromosome fragments C, I, L and M (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c,d</xref>, lanes g-h) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and hybridization signals to fragments C+M and I+L (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d</xref>, lanes g-h).</p></sec><sec><title>Two waves of expression are observed in the growth curve</title><p>Two waves of altered gene expression were seen during the growth curve (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>), the first with a peak at day 7, consisting of around 110 genes with expression upregulated twofold or more, and the second with a peak at day 9, consisting of three microarray signals that appear to represent a single ORF (see below) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). The peak of the first wave (day 7) was nearly coincident with crisis in the cell population (day 8) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>) and the time when telomeres were shortest (near day 7) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c,d</xref>). The second peak of gene expression at day 9 was coincident with the emergence of survivors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a-d</xref>).</p><p>The vast majority of expression changes involved upregulation, and only seven genes had downregulated expression of twofold or greater on two or more days of the growth curve. Notably, there were three cases of reduction in expression greater than tenfold: <italic>trt1</italic><sup>+ </sup>(intentionally knocked out), SPAC2E1P3.04 (a predicted copper amine oxidase) and SPAC2E1P3.05c (unknown function). Hybridizations of genomic DNA to microarrays (data not shown) revealed that genes SPAC2E1P3.04 and SPAC2E1P3.05c were deleted from the genome in all strains except WT 3, WT 5 and C1. Interestingly, these two genes are within about 4 kb of transposable element SPAC167.08 (Tf2-2), suggesting a hotspot for DNA excision. In no case was gene amplification detected by genomic hybridization (data not shown), so the observed increases in expression were most probably due to transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation, as opposed to changes in gene copy number.</p></sec><sec><title>Gene-expression changes in <italic>trt1</italic><sup>- </sup>cells</title><p>Because a relatively large number of <italic>trt1</italic><sup>- </sup>strains were studied, the identification of genes with consistently altered expression was facilitated by selecting those genes with expression changes of twofold or more in two or more days of the growth curve or, alternatively, in both strains C1 and C5. This criterion was met by 123 genes, of which 54 (44%) overlapped between the growth curve and survivors with circularized chromosomes. In addition, of the 67 genes that had their expression changed twofold or more exclusively in the growth curve, many displayed altered expression just below the cutoff in survivors with circularized chromosomes. Two genes - SPBC1683.06c (a predicted uridine ribohydrolase) and SPBC1198.01 (a predicted formaldehyde dehydrogenase) - had expression changes of twofold or more in both strains C1 and C5, but no significant changes during the growth curve. As a measure of confidence, 84 of the 123 genes (approximately 68%) met a more stringent criterion requiring a gene to change its expression in three or more of the 17 conditions. Additional confidence that expression changes scored as significant were not false positives came from the remarkably continuous manner in which gene expression changed throughout the growth curve (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>).</p><p>The 123 genes with altered expression encompass a broad range of functions, but were especially enriched in genes associated with energy production and carbohydrate metabolism (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). There were seven pseudogenes and 29 predicted genes that did not have assigned functions at the time of writing. For nearly all the gene-type categories, there was a larger number of genes with altered expression in the growth curve than in the survivors with circular chromosomes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). This difference may be attributable to the fact that cells in the growth curve were experiencing crisis whereas strains C1 and C5 were survivors, presumably with established mechanisms to cope with the absence of or the loss of telomeres.</p><p>The telomerase-deletion response had a large overlap with genes that changed expression in response to environmental stresses. Fission yeast stress-response genes can be separated into a CESR, in which genes changed expression in all or most of the stresses studied (oxidative stress, heavy metals, heat shock, osmotic stress and DNA damage), and into more specific stress responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Of the 123 genes with altered expression in <italic>trt1</italic><sup>- </sup>cells, 48 (about 39%) also had upregulated expression among a conservative list of CESR genes (<italic>P </italic>~ 10<sup>-77</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and two genes had downregulated expression in the CESR and in this study. Of the 110 genes with expression upregulated twofold or more on day 7 of the growth curve, 44% overlapped with the CESR. Comparison with a less conservative list of CESR genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] suggested that 54% of the 123 genes with altered expression in <italic>trt1</italic><sup>- </sup>cells had overlap with the CESR (<italic>P </italic>~ 10<sup>-81</sup>). With respect to specific stress responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], there were 17/123 genes in common with the oxidative stress response (<italic>P </italic>~ 10<sup>-32</sup>), and 11/123 genes in common with the heat stress response (<italic>P </italic>~ 10<sup>-24</sup>). The stress response study found that the DNA damage response and the oxidative stress response have substantial overlap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Therefore, the genes with altered expression in this study that overlap with the oxidative-stress response may represent a DNA damage response to short telomeres.</p></sec><sec><title>Chromosome structure and gene expression</title><p>Comparisons of all the gene-expression profiles in this study revealed striking differences between the profiles of survivors with linear chromosomes versus those with circular chromosomes. Survivors with linear chromosomes (days 12-15 of the growth curve) had gene-expression patterns similar to those of cells with native telomeres in the first two days of the growth curve. To illustrate, by day 12 of the growth curve, the gene-expression profiles of survivors became relatively constant and remained so through day 15. The profiles of days 12-15 appear most similar to days 1 and 2 of the growth curve, immediately after cells lost telomerase and were experiencing shortening telomeres (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). This observation was confirmed by hierarchical clustering (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>). Conversely, survivors with circular chromosomes had gene-expression profiles that most resembled those of cells in crisis during days 5-8 of the growth curve (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b,c</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Sustained stress response in survivors with circular chromosomes</title><p>There were 54 genes with clearly altered expression (twofold or more) mainly during crisis in the growth curve that also had altered expression in the survivors with circular chromosomes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The expression of all but three of these 54 genes was not altered in survivors with linear chromosomes (growth curve days 12-15) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Of the 54 genes, 30 (56%) overlapped with the conservative list of CESR genes (<italic>P </italic>~ 10<sup>-46</sup>), and eight genes (15%) overlapped with the oxidative stress response (<italic>P </italic>~ 10<sup>-14</sup>). There were 8/54 genes (15%) that overlapped with the heat stress response (<italic>P </italic>~ 10<sup>-17</sup>). Because of the extensive overlap of the 54 genes with the CESR, we conclude that survivors with circular chromosomes had a sustained stress response.</p><p>Of the 54 genes, 51 represent a gene-expression signature that differentiates survivors with circular chromosomes from those with linear chromosomes. As an independent test of whether these 51 genes can serve as a signature for cells with circularized chromosomes, two additional cultures (strains H1 and H2, see Materials and methods) with circularized chromosomes were grown and analyzed by microarray. Both strains clearly displayed altered expression of the 51 genes whereas survivors with linear chromosomes did not (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), thus validating this gene signature.</p></sec><sec><title>No altered expression of genes encoding recombination and telomere factors</title><p>One feature of microarray studies is that genes not previously recognized to be under the control of a common regulator can often be associated by similar expression patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. On the basis of this hypothesis, a list of genes known to be involved in telomere maintenance and recombination was inspected. However, the expression patterns of all these genes were not substantially changed throughout the course of the study (data not shown). Genes investigated included <italic>pku70</italic><sup>+ </sup>and <italic>lig4</italic><sup>+</sup>, which encode components of the non-homologous end-joining pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]; <italic>taz1</italic><sup>+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and <italic>pot1</italic><sup>+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] encoding telomere DNA-binding proteins; telomerase component <italic>est1</italic><sup>+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]; homologous recombination-related genes <italic>rad22</italic><sup>+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], <italic>rhp54</italic><sup>+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], <italic>rad32</italic><sup>+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and <italic>rhp51</italic><sup>+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]; RecQ helicase gene <italic>rqh1</italic><sup>+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]; silencing component <italic>clr4</italic><sup>+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]; and telomere maintenance components <italic>pof3</italic><sup>+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and <italic>rad3</italic><sup>+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Interestingly, even though <italic>pof3</italic><sup>+ </sup>and <italic>clr4</italic><sup>+ </sup>expression did not change, the genes with altered expression in this study had a statistically significant overlap with the lists of genes with induced expression in <italic>pof3 </italic>mutants (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 10<sup>-45</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and <italic>clr4 </italic>mutants (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 10<sup>-45</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]; a significant correlation was also observed with genes that changed expression in the RNA interference (RNAi)-machinery mutants <italic>dcr1</italic><sup>+</sup>, <italic>ago1</italic><sup>+ </sup>and <italic>rdp1</italic><sup>+ </sup>(<italic>P </italic>~ 10<sup>-22</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].

The sub-telomeric regions of chromosomes I and II have significant similarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. A BLAST search performed with the SPAC212.11 DNA sequence (5.6 kb) revealed a paralog, SPBCPT2R1.08c (6.3 kb), located on the right arm of chromosome II (the microarray had no probe for SPBCPT2R1.08c), and partial homology on the right arm of chromosome I. The annotated sequence of SPBCPT2R1.08c includes the entirety of the SPAC212.11 sequence with only a single base change. The SPAC212.11 sequence does not contain a stop codon because the ORF is located at the end of the sequencing contig, which ended before a stop codon was reached. Comparison with the annotated SPBCPT2R1.08c sequence suggests that SPAC212.11 has an additional 95 bp before the stop codon.</p><p>Both SPBCPT2R1.08c and SPAC212.11 are the last predicted genes on their respective sub-telomeric sequencing contigs.

However, these transcripts do not accumulate in wild-type cells. Reverse-strand centromeric transcripts are synthesized and rapidly processed by the RNAi machinery, while forward-strand synthesis is silenced transcriptionally. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Rdp1) associates with centromeric repeat DNA and may use siRNAs corresponding to centromeric transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] to prime forward transcription from reverse-strand templates, thus resulting in dsRNA formation and maintenance of the heterochromatic state. In the RNAi mutants <italic>dcr1</italic><sup>-</sup>, <italic>ago1</italic><sup>- </sup>and <italic>rdp1</italic><sup>-</sup>, centromeric silencing is abolished and accumulation of both forward and reverse centromeric transcripts is observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Microarray, northern blot and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis indicated that the putative helicase gene was robustly expressed in cells emerging from crisis, but was weakly (or not at all) expressed in wild-type cells, strains C1 and C5 and survivors with linear chromosomes (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a</xref>, and data not shown).

Arguing against this hypothesis, however, Southern analysis with probe P<sub>5' </sub>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), which is specific for the helicase, did not reveal any DNA rearrangements during crisis close to the helicase that might have contributed to loss of silencing (data not shown). Nevertheless, the loss of silencing observed might lead to expression of both strands of the putative helicase, as was found for centromeric <italic>dh </italic>repeats in RNAi mutants.</p><p>To test for the presence of both strands, strand-specific RT-PCR was used with primers spanning the <italic>dh </italic>repeats of the putative helicase (region P<sub><italic>dh </italic></sub>in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).

A major finding was the tight correlation between the structures of chromosomes in survivors and gene expression profiles. Survivors with linear chromosomes had expression profiles remarkably similar to cells with canonical - yet shortened - telomeres, whereas cells with circular chromosomes maintained the upregulated expression of a significant number of genes that also had upregulated expression during senescence.</p><p>The stress response in survivors with circular chromosomes had significant overlaps with the <italic>S. pombe </italic>CESR and with the heat and oxidative stress responses. The CESR consists of genes that had upregulated expression in all or most responses to oxidative stress, heavy metal stress, heat shock, osmotic stress and DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The stress response may persist in survivors with circularized chromosomes because of impaired DNA segregation and DNA breakage and rearrangement. Indeed, compared with wild-type cells, survivors with circular chromosomes are larger and have slower growth rates, indicating that functions related to cell division are impaired [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Telomeric repeats contribute to recruiting the molecular components collectively involved in the protective capping of chromosome ends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. These repeats are maintained in the absence of telomerase in cells from diverse organisms that normally use telomerase (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]). Interestingly, the survivors with linear chromosomes abated their stress response concomitant with the appearance of amplified telomeric and TAS repeats as rare survivors took over the population, suggesting that the repeats helped to ameliorate the stress response.</p><p>Neither cells in the growth curve that experienced shortened telomeres nor survivors with long telomeres displayed upregulation of telomeric gene expression, supporting the notion that telomeric length changes alone do not affect gene expression in <italic>S. pombe </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In addition, in survivors with circular chromosomes, only eight microarray signals, corresponding to as few as two genes (due to cross-hybridization) near former telomeres had altered expression, although such changes might have been expected as a result of the large alterations in chromosome structure at these sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with the budding yeast response to loss of telomerase</title><p>As in fission yeast, genes with changed expression in the budding yeast response to loss of telomerase had significant overlaps with genes whose expression was altered by environmental stresses such as heat shock, osmotic shock, dithiothreitol (DTT)<bold>, </bold>nitrogen starvation and peroxide ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]). A difference in the stress responses between the two yeasts was that in budding yeast a large but specific subset of the environmental stress-response genes persisted in survivors with linear chromosomes four days after crisis, whereas in fission yeast survivors with linear chromosomes, the stress response mostly abated by the fourth day after crisis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>, day 12). The different yeast responses may be due to a fission yeast telomere structure that was not as strongly recognized as aberrant, perhaps mitigating a DNA-damage response. It is also possible that had budding yeast survivors been followed longer, providing a period for adaptation, the stress response would have subsided.</p><p>In fission yeast, the expression of a number of mitochondrial ATP synthase genes was upregulated (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) with orthologs similarly induced in budding yeast.

First, transcript from this ORF was only weakly expressed in wild-type cells as determined by RT-PCR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a</xref>) (and was not detectable at all by northern hybridization, data not shown), consistent with transcriptional regulation of this ORF by heterochromatin. Second, expression of the putative helicase was robust in <italic>ago1</italic><sup>- </sup>and <italic>dcr1</italic><sup>- </sup>mutants, which would be expected if RNAi has a role in transcriptionally silencing this ORF. In <italic>trt1</italic><sup>- </sup>mutants experiencing genomic instability, we detected both forward and reverse transcripts of sub-telomeric <italic>dh </italic>repeats (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a</xref>). The presence of these complementary transcripts suggests the existence of dsRNA that had not been processed by the RNAi machinery, consistent with a lack of silencing at this locus. Intriguingly, after maximal expression of both strands on day 9 of the growth curve, subsequent downregulation was observed by day 15 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a</xref>), consistent with restoration of silencing.</p><p>While the finding of homology with <italic>dh </italic>repeats at the sub-telomere was unexpected, <italic>dh </italic>repeats have been shown to function in silencing at sites outside of centromeres and the mating-type locus.

The longest (nearly continuous) stretch of sequence with homology to <italic>dh </italic>repeats found in the helicase ORF was about 600 bp (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), presumably long enough to promote heterochromatin formation. In addition, RNAi-mediated silencing triggered by both a synthetic hairpin RNA and transposon long terminal repeats have been shown to induce heterochromatin formation away from centromeres and the mating-type locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p><p>In a separate study, telomeric silencing of a reporter gene and binding of Swi6 at the telomere were not affected in <italic>dcr1</italic><sup>-</sup>, <italic>ago1</italic><sup>- </sup>and <italic>rdp1</italic><sup>- </sup>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].
