Previously we have shown that there are significant differences in <italic>empA </italic>expression in two strains of <italic>V. anguillarum</italic>, M93Sm and NB10. It is hypothesized that differences in <italic>empA </italic>regulation are due to differences in binding of regulatory elements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Two strains of <italic>V. anguillarum</italic>, M93Sm and NB10, were examined and compared for the presence of DNA regulatory proteins that bind to and control the <italic>empA </italic>promoter region. Gel mobility shift assays, using a digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled oligomer containing a <italic>lux </italic>box-like element and the promoter for <italic>empA</italic>, were done to demonstrate the presence of a DNA-binding protein. Protein extracts from NB10 cells incubated in Luria Bertani broth + 2% NaCl (LB20), nine salts solution + 200 &#x003bc;g/ml mucus (NSSM), 3M (marine minimal medium), or NSS resulted in a gel mobility shift. No gel mobility shift was seen when protein extracts from either LB20- or NSSM-grown M93Sm cells were mixed with the DIG-labeled <italic>empA </italic>oligomer. The azocasein assay detected protease activity in all incubation conditions for NB10 culture supernatants. In contrast, protease activity was detected in M93Sm culture supernatants only when incubated in NSSM. Since the <italic>luxR </italic>homologue in <italic>V. anguillarum</italic>, <italic>vanT</italic>, has been cloned, sequenced, and shown to be required for protease activity, we wanted to determine if <italic>vanT </italic>mutants of NB10 exhibit the same gel shift observed in the wild-type. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to create <italic>vanT </italic>mutants in <italic>V. anguillarum </italic>M93Sm and NB10 to test whether VanT is involved with the gel mobility shift. Both <italic>vanT </italic>mutants, M02 and NB02, did not produce protease activity in any conditions.

NB10 cells express <italic>empA </italic>during stationary phase in all growth conditions. The DNA binding protein is not present in M93Sm extracts. M93Sm cells express protease activity only when incubated at high cell density in fish gastrointestinal mucus. The gel shift observed with NB10 cells is not due to VanT binding. The data also suggest that the DNA binding protein is responsible for the less restrictive expression of <italic>empA </italic>in NB10 compared to M93Sm.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p><italic>Vibrio anguillarum </italic>is the causative agent of vibriosis, one of the major bacterial diseases affecting fish, bivalves, and crustaceans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Vibriosis has been a major problem for the aquaculture industry around the world. Large economic losses due to this fish pathogen are sustained by the fish farming industry. Annual losses of cultured fish species in Japan alone exceed $30 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Vibriosis in fish is observed as a hemorrhagic septicemia. Infected fish display skin discoloration and erythema around the base of the fins, vent, and mouth. Necrotic lesions form in the abdominal muscle. Mortalities within affected fish farm stocks range from 30&#x02013;100% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Extracellular metalloproteases are important virulence factors for many pathogenic bacteria including <italic>Vibrio cholerae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and <italic>Vibrio vulnificus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The EmpA metalloprotease genes of <italic>V. anguillarum </italic>strains NB10 and M93Sm have been cloned and sequenced by Milton et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and Denkin and Nelson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], respectively. The EmpA metalloprotease of <italic>V. anguillarum </italic>shares significant sequence homology with other known proteases. Although the role of the EmpA metalloprotease is not completely understood, we showed previously that <italic>V. anguillarum empA </italic>mutants are either avirulent or attenuated for virulence in Atlantic salmon depending on the route of inoculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. It can be hypothesized that EmpA causes tissue damage during pathogenesis.</p><p>Recently, the <italic>Vibrio harveyi luxR </italic>(LuxR<sub>Vh</sub>) homologue in <italic>V. anguillarum</italic>, <italic>vanT</italic>, was cloned, sequenced, and shown to be required for protease activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. LuxR<sub>Vh </sub>dependent regulation of luminescence in <italic>V. harveyi </italic>occurs at the promoter of the <italic>lux </italic>operon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. While the amino acid sequence of LuxR<sub>Vh </sub>in <italic>V. harveyi </italic>is not similar to the LuxR<sub>Vf </sub>protein in <italic>V. fischeri </italic>which also regulates luminescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], it is thought that LuxR<sub>Vh </sub>binds to the <italic>lux </italic>box and activates the expression of the luciferase genes. Since LuxR<sub>Vh </sub>functions as a transcriptional activator in <italic>V. harveyi </italic>and VanT is required for protease expression in <italic>V. anguillarum</italic>, we wanted to determine whether any proteins bind to the regulatory regions (e.g. the <italic>lux </italic>box-like element and promoter) immediately upstream of <italic>empA</italic>.</p><p>We have previously shown that <italic>V. anguillarum </italic>cells grow rapidly in Atlantic salmon intestinal mucus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and that <italic>empA </italic>is strongly induced when cells are incubated at high density in mucus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Further, we have demonstrated that <italic>empA </italic>transcription is RpoS-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Our findings also suggest that quorum sensing and undescribed autoinducer(s) help to regulate the expression of <italic>empA </italic>in <italic>V. anguillarum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Additionally, Milton et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] previously identified a <italic>lux</italic> box-like element about 70 bp upstream of the translational start of <italic>empA</italic>, which we subsequently showed to span the transcriptional start site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In this study, we examine, compare, and contrast the expression of metalloprotease encoded by <italic>empA </italic>in two strains of <italic>V. anguillarum </italic>(M93Sm and NB10). Differences in <italic>empA </italic>expression were investigated with regards to various growth conditions, the presence or absence of DNA-binding proteins, and putative regulatory proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Gel shift analysis of the <italic>empA </italic>promoter</title><p>The possibility of DNA-binding proteins interacting with regulatory sequences of <italic>empA</italic>, were examined using a digoxigenin (DIG) labeled oligomer containing the <italic>lux </italic>box-like element and <italic>empA </italic>promoter region. The location of double stranded oligomer relative to the promoter and coding sequences is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. Protein extracts from <italic>V. anguillarum </italic>M93Sm and NB10 cells incubated in LB20 and NSSM were mixed with the DIG-labeled oligomer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). NB10 and M93Sm cells were incubated in LB20 and NSSM for 3 h and protein extracts from cells at 0 and 3 h were prepared. DNA binding was observed in protein extracts from NB10 incubated in LB20 and NSSM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) at both 0 and 3 h. A 3.7-fold increase (from T = 0 h) in the amount of DNA binding was observed by 3 h in extracts from NSSM-grown NB10 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, NB10 lane 2). An additional 1.4-fold increase in DNA binding was observed when the amount of protein was increased from 5 &#x003bc;g to 7.5 &#x003bc;g (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, NB10 lane 3). Although only a minor change in the amount of DNA binding (1.4-fold increase) was detectable by 3 h in NB10 extract from LB20-grown cells, a 4.7-fold decrease (from T = 0 h) in free DIG-labeled oligomer was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, NB10 lane 2). In addition, a 8.9-fold decrease in free DIG-labeled oligomer was detected when 7.5 &#x003bc;g protein was added (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, NB10 lane 3). Specificity of protein binding to the DIG-labeled oligomer was tested by competitive inhibition of binding by the addition of excess amounts of an identical unlabeled oligomer. When excess unlabeled <italic>lux </italic>box-<italic>empA </italic>promoter oligomer was added to protein extracts from LB20- and NSSM-grown NB10 cells binding to the DIG-labeled oligomer was abolished. Further, the addition of unlabeled oct2A (a non-competitive oligomer) to protein extracts did not affect the gel mobility shift of the DIG-labeled oligomer caused by protein extracts from NB10 cells incubated either in LB20 or NSSM. In contrast to protein extracts from NB10 cells grown in LB20 or NSSM causing a gel shift, protein extracts from M93Sm cells incubated in either condition did not show any binding to the DIG-labeled oligomer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Even when 7.5 &#x003bc;g of protein was used, a band shift was not observed. In a separate experiment, protein extracts from NB10 cells incubated in 3M or starved in NSS also caused a similar gel mobility shift for the DIG-labeled oligomer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Additionally, even when 5 &#x003bc;g of protein extract from exponentially growing NB10 cells in LB20 was added to the DIG-labeled oligomer, a band shift was observed. Further, in this gel shift experiment, M93Sm protein extract was added as a negative control to the labeled DIG-labeled oligomer and no shift was observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Protease activity in LB20, NSSM, 3M, and NSS</title><p>Expression of <italic>empA </italic>in NB10 occurs in both LB20 and NSSM, while M93Sm exhibits <italic>empA </italic>expression only in NSSM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Since a gel mobility shift was observed in NB10 protein extracts in all conditions of growth and during starvation, these cells were tested for protease activity in 3M and NSS in addition to LB20 and NSSM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Protease activity was detected in NB10 cells after 1 and 3 h of incubation in NSSM or LB20, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Maximum protease activity was observed at 4 h for both conditions of incubation. In addition, protease activity was observed in NB10 cells incubated in 3M or starved in NSS after 1 h and continued to increase during the next hour of the 4 h experiment. Throughout the incubation, NB10 cells in 3M produced 3&#x02013;4 fold greater amounts of protease activity than cells in NSS. The amount of protease measured in NSS at 4 h was only 14 and 17% of the amount produced in LB20 and NSSM, respectively. In contrast, protease activity was observed in M93Sm cells only when incubated in NSSM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). M93Sm cells did not produce protease activity in any of the other conditions examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of <italic>vanT </italic>mutations on protease activity and gel mobility shift</title><p>Since <italic>vanT </italic>of <italic>V. anguillarum </italic>NB10 was cloned, sequenced and shown to be required for protease activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], <italic>vanT </italic>mutants of both M93Sm and NB10 were created by site directed mutagenesis and tested for protease activity in LB20 and NSSM. When the mutants (NB02 and M02) were incubated in NSSM for 3 h, a small amount of protease activity was detected (5 and 13% of the wild-type levels, respectively) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

Neither <italic>vanT </italic>mutant produced <italic>vanT </italic>transcripts.

Protein extracts from NB02 cells incubated in NSSM and LB20 exhibited binding to the DIG-labeled oligomer similar to that observed with protein extracts from wild-type NB10 cells (compare to Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). These data show that VanT was not responsible for the gel mobility shift of the <italic>lux </italic>box &#x02013; <italic>empA </italic>promoter oligomer.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>It has been demonstrated that the transcriptional activator, LuxR<sub>Vf</sub>, in <italic>Vibrio fischeri</italic>, activates expression of the <italic>lux </italic>operon via interaction with the <italic>lux </italic>box [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Although there is incomplete understanding of LuxR<sub>Vf </sub>interaction with the <italic>lux </italic>box, good evidence is available that shows a specific <italic>lux </italic>box sequence required for efficient LuxR<sub>Vf </sub>binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. LuxR<sub>Vh </sub>from <italic>V. harveyi </italic>and LuxR<sub>Vf </sub>from <italic>V. fischeri </italic>are not the same transcriptional activator proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. These proteins differ in their activation of the <italic>lux </italic>operon. In <italic>V. fischeri</italic>, LuxR<sub>Vf </sub>interacts with an acylhomoserine lactone autoinducer and then binds to the <italic>lux </italic>box to activate transcription of the <italic>lux </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In <italic>V. harveyi</italic>, the regulation of luminescence occurs via a phosphorelay signal transduction system, which involves LuxR<sub>Vh </sub>binding to the <italic>lux </italic>box independent of an autoinducer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Additionally, a central response regulator, LuxO, has been shown to regulate the expression of <italic>luxR </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] in <italic>V. harveyi</italic>. Recently, the LuxR<sub>Vh </sub>homologue of <italic>V. fischeri </italic>was identified as LitR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, it is not known if <italic>V. fischeri </italic>uses a phosphorelay cascade to control LitR interaction with the <italic>lux </italic>operon.</p><p>In this study, two strains of <italic>V. anguillarum </italic>(NB10 and M93Sm) were examined for a <italic>empA </italic>promoter region binding protein. In all conditions, incubation with NB10 protein extracts resulted in a gel mobility shift to the DIG-labeled oligomer. In contrast, M93Sm extracts did not show any protein binding to the labeled DNA in any conditions tested. This was interesting because NB10 protease production occurs in all conditions, while M93Sm protease activity is detected only when the cells are incubated in mucus. Recently, VanT, the LuxR<sub>Vh </sub>homolog in <italic>V. anguillarum</italic>, was identified by Milton et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and shown to positively regulate EmpA metalloprotease and biofilm production. We created <italic>vanT </italic>mutants in both M93Sm and NB10 and tested them for <italic>vanT </italic>expression, protease activity, and DNA binding. These two mutants, M02 and NB02, did not produce detectable <italic>vanT </italic>mRNA. However, both exhibited low levels of protease activity in mucus - about 5% and 13% of wild type activity in mucus, respectively. For NB02, no protease activity in LB20 was observed. These results demonstrate that <italic>vanT </italic>is required for protease activity in a non-mucus containing medium (<italic>V. anguillarum </italic>NB10 in LB20), confirming the result reported by Milton et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Our results also show that in NSSM, <italic>vanT </italic>mutants still exhibit some protease activity, but VanT is required for full protease activity in both M02 and NB02 cells.</p><p>We tested a <italic>vanT </italic>mutant of <italic>V. anguillarum </italic>for the possibility of VanT binding to and activation of <italic>empA </italic>expression. Since the <italic>V. anguillarum </italic>NB10 strain expresses <italic>empA </italic>during stationary phase in all conditions tested and protein extracts from these conditions show DNA binding to the <italic>empA </italic>promoter region, it was hypothesized that VanT binds to this region. The <italic>vanT </italic>mutant, NB02, was analyzed for gel shift using protein extracts from cells incubated in LB20 and NSSM. Protein extracts from NB02 cells incubated in each condition still caused a band shift. This result suggests that VanT, the LuxR<sub>Vh </sub>homolog in <italic>V. anguillarum</italic>, either does not bind to the <italic>empA </italic>promoter region containing the <italic>lux </italic>box-like element or perhaps VanT binds to a second protein that binds to this DNA sequence. The former possibility is more likely since the gel shift observed in NB02 is identical to that observed in NB10 extracts. Further, since the M93Sm <italic>vanT </italic>mutant, M02 still exhibits about 13% of the wild type protease activity in NSSM and does not exhibit protein binding in the gel shift analysis, it is probable that VanT does not bind to the <italic>empA </italic>promoter-<italic>lux </italic>box region. However, Croxatto et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] demonstrated recently that purified VanT protein binds to the <italic>V. anguillarum </italic>NB10 promoter regions for <italic>empA</italic>, <italic>vanOU</italic>, and <italic>vanT</italic>. Examination of their data shows that VanT binds more strongly to the promoters for <italic>vanOU </italic>and <italic>vanT </italic>(binding observed with 0.3 &#x003bc;g purified VanT per 2 ng DIG-labeled DNA) than to the <italic>empA </italic>promoter (binding observed with 2.5 &#x003bc;g VanT per 2 ng DIG-labeled DNA). It should be noted that in our study only 5 &#x003bc;g of total protein extract was used in the gel shift analysis. That binding to the <italic>empA </italic>promoter is still observed in <italic>vanT </italic>mutants strongly suggests that an unidentified protein binds to the promoter-<italic>lux </italic>box region.</p><p>Previously, we have shown that <italic>empA </italic>in <italic>V. anguillarum </italic>M93Sm is positively regulated by at least two components of salmon gastrointestinal mucus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In this study we show that NB10 cells exhibit protease activity under all nutritional conditions including starvation in NSS when at high density, whereas M93Sm only induces protease activity in mucus. RpoS is required for expression of <italic>empA </italic>in both M93Sm and NB10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This was demonstrated by the observation that <italic>rpoS </italic>mutants of M93Sm (M03) and NB10 (NB03) exhibit no protease activity when cells are incubated in either LB20 or mucus during stationary phase. Extracellular factors present in conditioned media showed both positive and negative effects on <italic>empA </italic>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. LB20 conditioned supernatants from M93Sm cause a more rapid and increased production of protease activity (in NB10 and M93Sm cells). However, conditioned LB20 from the <italic>luxS </italic>mutant, M01added to wild-type cells results in a more rapid induction of protease activity, which suggests that AI-2 may act as a negative regulator of <italic>empA</italic>.</p><p>In this study we confirmed that VanT is required for <italic>empA </italic>expression in NB10 when incubated in LB20; however, when NB10 or M93Sm cells are incubated in NSSM, a small percentage of protease activity remains in the <italic>vanT </italic>mutants. Our data support the observation by Croxatto et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] that VanT positively regulates <italic>empA </italic>expression. Further, the role of VanT as a transcriptional activator of <italic>empA </italic>via the <italic>lux </italic>box-like element has not been established. Our data show that VanT does not bind to the <italic>empA </italic>promoter <italic>lux </italic>box-like region, but is required for maximum protease activity. In addition, we show that in NB10 an unknown protein binds to the <italic>empA </italic>promoter-<italic>lux </italic>box region that may increase protease activity in all conditions. In contrast, M93Sm protein binding to this region is not observed and protease activity is detected only when cells are incubated in mucus. In conclusion, the expression of the <italic>empA </italic>virulence gene in <italic>V. anguillarum </italic>is regulated transcriptionally by the alternative &#x003c3;-factor RpoS (&#x003c3;<sup>S</sup>) and the transcriptional activator VanT (a LuxR<sub>Vh </sub>homologue). Additionally, an unknown DNA binding protein binds specifically to the <italic>empA </italic>promoter <italic>lux </italic>box-like region in NB10 cells, but not in M93Sm cells. We hypothesize that this protein permits <italic>empA </italic>expression in the absence of the inducing factors in fish gastrointestinal mucus. A better understanding of how and why these two wild-type strains of <italic>V. anguillarum </italic>exhibit different levels of <italic>empA </italic>expression will further reveal how virulence genes are regulated in this fish pathogen.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Differences in <italic>empA </italic>expression between the two strains of <italic>V. anguillarum</italic>, M93Sm and NB10, correspond with the production of an unknown regulatory protein that binds to a 50 bp oligomer identical to the promoter-<italic>lux </italic>box region of <italic>empA</italic>. For NB10, protein binding to the oligomer correlated with the expression of <italic>empA </italic>in all incubation conditions. However, M93Sm, which expresses <italic>empA </italic>only in mucus, did not exhibit protein binding in this condition. Additionally, a null mutation in <italic>vanT </italic>(<italic>luxR </italic>homologue) results in severely decreased or no <italic>empA </italic>expression, but does not abolish protein binding (in NB10) to the oligomer. Our data suggest that while <italic>empA </italic>expression in both <italic>V. anguillarum </italic>M93Sm and NB10 is dependent upon RpoS and VanT, the two strains differ in production of an unknown protein that binds to the promoter-<italic>lux </italic>box-like region of <italic>empA</italic>.

These oligomers were synthesized and purified by HPLC (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). The oligomers were annealed, labeled, and used in the gel shift reactions according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche). An 8% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 &#x000d7; TBE (Tris-borate-EDTA buffer) was prepared and used for electrophoresis (in 0.5 &#x000d7; TBE) of the gel shift reactions. Blotting was performed using a Biorad electro-blotting system (model Trans blot) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Chemiluminescence detection of DIG-labeled DNA-protein complexes on the nylon membranes was detected using Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Pharmacia). Gel mobility shift fluorograms were examined quantitatively using a densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Personal Densitometer, SI). All gel mobility shift experiments were repeated three times and the data presented are representative examples of each experiment.</p></sec><sec><title>Detection and quantification of protease activity</title><p>Culture supernatants were assayed for proteolytic activity using our previously described modification of the method by Windle and Kelleher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Briefly, culture supernatant was incubated with azocasein (5 mg/ml) dissolved in Tris-HCl (50 mM, pH 8.0) containing 0.04% NaN<sub>3</sub>. Culture supernatant was prepared by centrifuging 1 ml of cells at 12,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g </italic>(10 min, 20&#x000b0;C). Supernatant was removed and filtered through a 0.22 &#x003bc;m pore size cellulose-acetate filter. Filtered supernatant (100 &#x003bc;l) was incubated at 30&#x000b0;C with 100 &#x003bc;l of azocasein solution. Incubation time of 30 min was sufficient for assays of supernatants from cell suspensions of &#x02265; 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8 </sup>cells/ml. Reactions were terminated by addition of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) (10% wt/vol) to a final concentration of 6.7% (wt/vol). The mixture was allowed to stand for 1 to 2 min and centrifuged (12,000 &#x000d7; <italic>g</italic>, 4 min) to remove unreacted azocasein, and supernatant containing azopeptides was suspended in 700 &#x003bc;l of 525 mM NaOH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Absorbance of the azopeptide supernatant was measured at 442 nm using a Pharmacia Ultrospec 4000 spectrophotometer. A blank control was prepared by boiling <italic>V. anguillarum </italic>M93Sm supernatant (100&#x000b0;C, 10 min). TCA (final concentration 10%) was added to the blank control supernatant immediately after the addition of azocasein. The mucus used was also boiled (10 min) to destroy any inherent protease activity. Protease activity units were calculated using the following equation: 1 protease activity unit = [1000 (OD<sub>442</sub>)/CFU] &#x000d7; (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>)] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>RNA isolation and RT-PCR conditions</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from <italic>V. anguillarum </italic>cells as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] using the RNeasy purification kit (QIAGEN). Reverse transcriptase (RT) reactions were performed using the OneStep RT-PCR system from QIAGEN. Prior to the RT reaction, RNA samples (2 &#x003bc;g) were treated with RQ1 (RNase-free) DNase (1 U/&#x003bc;l) according to the manufacturer's specifications (Promega, Madison, WI.).
