Mutations in the human neutrophil elastase gene (<italic>ELA2</italic>), causing increased intracellular concentration of this serine protease, inhibits neutrophil differentiation in severe congenital neutropenia (SCN). Since the clinical symptoms of agranulocytosis and SCN are similar, we hypothesized that it may origin from a common genetic variation in <italic>ELA2 </italic>or that sulphasalazine may affect human neutrophil elastase activity and protein expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We screened for genetic differences in <italic>ELA2 </italic>in DNA from 36 patients who had suffered from sulphasalazine-induced agranulocytosis, and compared them with 72 patients treated with sulphasalazine without blood reactions. We also performed in vitro studies of the blood cell lines HL60 and U937 after sulphasalazine exposure with respect to cell survival index, neutrophil elastase protein expression and activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>None of the mutations in <italic>ELA2</italic>, which previously have been reported to be associated with SCN, was found in this material. Protein expression of human neutrophil elastase in lymphoma U937 cells was not affected by treatment with concentrations equivalent to therapeutic doses. Cell survival of lymphoma U937 and promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells was not affected in this concentration range, but exhibited a decreased proliferative capacity with higher sulphasalazine concentrations. Interestingly the promyelocytic cells were more sensitive to sulphasalazine than the lymphoma cell line.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Neutrophil elastase expression and <italic>ELA2 </italic>mutations do, however, not seem to be involved in the etilogy of sulphasalazine-induced agranulocytosis. Why sulphasalazine is more toxic to promyelocytes than to lymphocytes remains to be explained.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Sulphasalazine (SA) has anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive and antibiotic actions, and is a component in the therapy of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis. Bacterial enzymes in the colon split sulphasalazine into sulphapyridine and 5-aminosalicylic acid before it is absorbed. Sulphapyridine acts as a sulphonamide antibiotic, whereas 5-aminosalicylic acid is believed to be the anti-inflammatory metabolite. Common side/toxic effects are vomiting, skin rash and headache. The incidence of the hematological adverse effects associated with sulphasalazine is generally low, but the reactions can be severe and sometimes fatal. The risk of sulphasalazine-induced agranulocytosis, i.e. profoundly depressed circulating neutrophils is highest within the first three months of sulphasalazine-treatment, with a fatality rate of 6.5 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Clinical symptoms of agranulocytosis include fever, malaise and susceptibility to infections. Patients with arthritic disorders have a greater risk of developing sulphasalazine-induced agranulocytosis than patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</p><p>Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) and cyclic neutropenia (CN) occur both as inherited and as sporadic diseases. SCN has a constant low neutrophil number if left untreated, whereas CN manifests with cyclic oscillations of neutrophil number with a 21-day cycle. Recently, diverse heterozygous mutations in <italic>ELA2</italic>, encoding human neutrophil elastase, have been identified in a majority of the cases with CN and two-thirds of the cases with SCN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we hypothesized that sulphasalazine-induced agranulocytosis, with clinical symptoms similar to congenital neutropenia, may arise from genetic variation in the human neutrophil elastase gene. We genotyped 108 sulphasalazine-treated patients for <italic>ELA2</italic>, one third which of had experienced sulphasalazine-induced agranulocytosis. We, furthermore, tested for cytotoxic doses of sulphasalazine, and studied protein expression of human neutrophil elastase in sulphasalazine-treated blood cell lines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Patients were treated with sulphasalazine (Salazopyrin, Pharmacia, Sweden) for inflammatory joint diseases and inflammatory bowel disease. The cases with sulphasalazine-induced agranulocytosis were originally collected through the Swedish Medical Products Agency's register of adverse side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The control group had been treated with sulphasalazine without adverse effects for at least 3 months. From the original patient material consisting of 39 cases and 75 controls, DNA was available for 36 cases and 72 controls. The patient journals were studied for information concerning neutrophil differentiation in bone marrow aspirates. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty at Uppsala University, registration number 95&#x02013;200.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutation analysis</title><p>Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood using standard techniques. Fragments covering exons 2&#x02013;5 of <italic>ELA2 </italic>were amplified by PCR using primer pairs listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. The selection of exons 2&#x02013;5 and some of the flanking intron sequences was based on previously reported mutations in cases with SCN and CN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], as outlined in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. Products for exon 2&#x02013;5 were amplified with 1.5 units of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems), activated by 15 min at 95&#x000b0;C followed by 4 cycles 94&#x000b0;C 30 sec, 65&#x000b0;C 30 sec, 72&#x000b0;C 1.5 min and 35 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C 30 sec, 67&#x000b0;C 30 sec, 72&#x000b0;C 1.5 min with a final extension of 10 min at 72&#x000b0;C. The exception was amplification of exon 5, where a 2&#x000b0;C lower annealing temperature was used. All primers contained a consensus M13 sequence to enable sequencing with the same primer, included in BigDye Primer sequencing kit from Applied Biosystems, Stockholm, Sweden. Applied Biosystems 310 analyzer and Sequence Analysis software was used for all sequencing.

For protein isolation, cells were washed in PBS and lysed in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and were kept on ice for 30 min. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 10 000 &#x000d7; g, and protein concentration was determined using BioRad protein assay.

The supernatants were transferred to new tubes and assayed for elastase activity using Suc-Ala-Ala-Ala-pNA (Sigma) as a substrate. For each assay we took 25 &#x003bc;l sample, mixed with 100 &#x003bc;l buffer containing 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, 1 M NaCl, 500 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>and 0.1 % Triton X-100. To this, 50 &#x003bc;l of substrate was added, to a final concentration 1 &#x003bc;M. After 30 min of incubation in room temperature, absorbance was read at 405 nm and the concentration was calculated from a standard curve of elastase (Sigma).</p></sec><sec><title>Cell survival index</title><p>For the cell viability assay, we used a fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay (FMCA) previously described by Larsson et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Briefly, 20 000 cells/well were plated in 96-well plates (NUNC, DK) in complete medium with addition of increased concentrations of sulphasalazine (0, 125, 250, 500, 750 and 1000 &#x003bc;M) and incubated for 72 h in a humidified atmosphere used in regular cell culturing. All samples were plated in triplicates and three wells with cell culture medium served as blanks. As controls we had cells without additions and cells only with solvent, in this case 0.5 M NaOH, with equal molarities as in the wells with the highest sulphasalazine-concentration. At the end of the 72 h incubation period, plates were centrifuged (200 &#x000d7; g, 5 min) and medium was aspirated in a microtitre plate washer, washed with PBS and 100 &#x003bc;l of 10 &#x003bc;g/ml of fluorescein diacetate (Sigma, Sweden), was added. This dye exclusively binds intact cell membranes of viable cells. After 1 h incubation at 37&#x000b0;C, the fluorescence was read in the Fluoroscan 2 (Labsystems OY, Finland) at 480 nm excitation and 530 nm as emission. The results are presented as survival index, defined as fluorescence in test wells/ fluorescence in control wells (blank values subtracted) &#x000d7; 100. Thus, a low numerical value indicates high sensitivity to the cytotoxic effect of sulphasalazine. Effective concentration is defined as the concentration when 50 % of the cells are viable (EC<sub>50</sub>).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>Two-tailed Student's t-test was used to compare subject characteristics and results from cell culture between cases and controls.

Toxic drug-induced neutropenia is often dose-dependent, whereas immunological and genetic causes are less related to dose. In our study, bone marrow aspirates from patients with sulphasalazine-induced agranulocytosis revealed maturation arrest of neutrophils at the promyelocyte-myelocyte stage. These findings resemble promyelocytic maturation arrest seen in severe congenital neutopenia (SCN) and cyclic neutropenia (CN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In the majority of cases with SCN and CN, germline mutations in the human neutrophil elastase gene (<italic>ELA2</italic>) are implicated as the primary abnormality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The focus of this study is therefore on the human neutrophil elastase gene as a possible cause of sulphasalazine-induced agranulocytosis. We found a coding synonymous polymorphism in <italic>ELA2</italic>, which, however, was equally represented among cases and controls.</p><p>Heterozygous mutations in <italic>ELA2 </italic>act in a dominant manner, interfering with sub-cellular trafficking of neutrophil elastase, and leading to an accumulation of neutrophil elastase in the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. For normal neutrophil cell maturation, the proliferative action of the granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. When G-CSF is exposed to active elastase enzyme in vitro, G-CSF is rapidly cleaved and rendered inactive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In theory, SCN and CN are caused by an accumulation of neutrophil elastase, leading to an inactivation of G-CSF and a negative feedback on granulopoiesis, which causes neutropenia. Other proteins, connected to expression and transportation of human neutrophil elastase, have also been linked to SCN disease. In canine cyclic hematopoieses, lack of the intracellular transport protein AP3&#x003b2; causes accumulation of canine neutrophil elastase in the cytosolic compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and mutations in <italic>ELA2 </italic>may disrupt the AP3&#x003b2;-recognition site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, mutations in the proto-oncogene <italic>GFI1</italic>, a transcriptional repressor of <italic>ELA2</italic>, causes over-expression of neutrophil elastase in mice, thus, making them neutropenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>During maintenance therapy with sulphasalazine, trough serum sulpha concentration is on average approximately 100 &#x003bc;M at the Department of Clinical chemistry and pharmacology, Uppsala University hospital. To avoid toxic effects, trough serum concentration of sulpha should stay below 600 &#x003bc;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Our in vitro data suggest a decreased cell survival of sulphasalazine at concentrations around 500 &#x003bc;M. Interestingly promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells were more sensitive to sulphasalazine than lymphoma U937 cells, with EC<sub>50 </sub>values of 370 &#x003bc;M and 820 &#x003bc;M, respectively. Human neutrophil elastase expression in lymphoma U937 cells did not differ after sulphasalazine at 125 and 250 &#x003bc;M, indicating that human neutrophil elastase production is not affected by sulphasalazine at subtoxic levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, neutrophil elastase does not appear to be involved in the etiology of sulphasalazine-induced agranulocytosis. No causative <italic>ELA2 </italic>mutations were found, and therapeutic concentrations of sulphasalazine did not increase the expression of human neutrophil elastase. High concentrations of sulphasalazine were toxic to white blood cells in vitro; however, there is no evidence that this toxicity is mediated through human neutrophil elastase. Promyelocytic cells were more sensitive to sulphasalazine than lymphoma cells, and the reason for this difference may also explain sulphasalazine-induced agranulocytosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AJ carried out the molecular genetic studies, participated in the sequence alignment, drafted the manuscript and carried out the in vitro experiments.
