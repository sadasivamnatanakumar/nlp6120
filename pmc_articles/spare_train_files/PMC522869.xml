The global network of interactions between transcription factors and promoters in yeast is increasingly being characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The role of chromatin in gene regulation is less clear, however. For example, the distribution of nucleosomes, the fundamental units of chromatin, is poorly understood on a gene-specific basis, much less a global basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The nucleosome consists of approximately 146 base-pairs (bp) of DNA wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins - two each of histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. Eukaryotic genomes are packaged into repeating units of nucleosomes separated by around 10-80 bp of linker DNA. High occupancy by nucleosomes is thought to be generally repressive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and extensive remodeling (and loss) of nucleosomes occurs in the promoters of genes undergoing activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In the case of the <italic>PHO5 </italic>promoter in yeast, this remodeling proceeds until essentially no nucleosomes are detected across a region of several hundred base-pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Transcription factors and chromatin proteins each form complex regulatory networks that interact in a variety of ways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Transcription factors modify chromatin structure by recruiting enzymes that remodel nucleosomes or posttranslationally modify histones (by acetylation or methylation, for example) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The modifications can be maintained through cell division and propagated to proximal nucleosomes by positive-feedback mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Hence, a signal such as the activation of a transcription factor can be temporally and spatially transmitted through chromatin. Conversely, chromatin can influence transcription factor function by modulating the accessibility of target binding sites in the DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>We used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and DNA microarrays to evaluate nucleosome occupancy levels for essentially all promoters in yeast. Promoters that regulate active genes, contain multiple conserved motifs or recruit Rap1 tend to be relatively nucleosome-depleted. We also used real-time PCR and micrococcal nuclease digestion to show that nucleosomes are depleted in the vicinity of Rap1 consensus sites. This depletion can be partially reversed by the actions of the small molecule rapamycin or by removing Rap1-binding sites. We suggest that other transcription factors have less robust nucleosome-depleting activities than Rap1 and must therefore act collaboratively to gain access to their cognate sites in the DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>ChIP-based assay for nucleosome occupancy</title><p>Histones are essential components of the nucleosome and efficiently cross-link to nucleosomal DNA. Antibodies against invariant portions of histones have been used previously in ChIP assays to follow nucleosome loss at the yeast <italic>PHO5 </italic>promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. We extended this approach to evaluate relative nucleosome occupancy at essentially all promoters and other intergenic regions in yeast. DNA associated <italic>in vivo </italic>with histone H3 was isolated by ChIP using antibody against the carboxy terminus of histone H3 (no posttranslational modifications are thought to occur in this region). ChIP DNA and unenriched control DNA were amplified by <italic>in vitro </italic>transcription and evaluated using microarrays. DNA associated with histone H2B was evaluated in a similar fashion using anti-FLAG antibody and a FLAG-H2B strain. H3 and H2B datasets were compiled by averaging four and three independent biological experiments, respectively. These datasets are remarkably similar as shown by a genome-wide correlation of 0.83 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a-c</xref>). This correlation is comparable to that observed when comparing replicate H3 datasets (or H2B datasets), and suggests that both assays measure similar phenomena. In the H3 and H2B datasets, respectively, there are 347 and 214 regions depleted at least 1.5-fold relative to the average over all intergenics. In contrast, there are just 84 and 6 regions in the respective datasets enriched at least 1.5-fold relative to this average. The relatively narrow range of ChIP enrichment and the negative skew of the data (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>) are consistent with the conventional view that the majority of the genome is packaged into nucleosomes with intervening stretches of free DNA such as the activated <italic>PHO5 </italic>promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Despite these consistencies, a possible caveat to using ChIP to evaluate nucleosome occupancy is that immunoprecipitation efficiency can depend on epitope accessibility. Rather than having low occupancies, genomic regions depleted in the H3 ChIP might be inaccessible as a result of association with large protein complexes in chromatin. To investigate this possibility, we examined a published chromatin fractionation dataset in which cross-linked chromatin fragments were subjected to phenol-chloroform extraction and DNA that partitioned into the aqueous phase was quantified by microarrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Given the polar nature of DNA and the hydrophobic nature of denatured protein, aqueous extraction should generally enrich for free DNA. We found that regions depleted in the H3 ChIP assay overlap extensively with regions enriched by aqueous extraction, but not with regions depleted by aqueous extraction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>). Overall, there is a negative correlation of -0.54 between the H3 ChIP and aqueous-extraction datasets. Although the fractionation data may partially reflect differential cross-linking of lysines in the histone tails [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], this analysis suggests that regions depleted in the H3 ChIP experiment are relatively protein-free, as would be expected of non-nucleosomal DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Nucleosome occupancy correlates inversely with promoter strength</title><p>As previous studies show that <italic>PHO5 </italic>activation is accompanied by marked nucleosome loss in the promoter region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], we sought to determine whether nucleosome depletion is a general attribute of active promoters. A total of 4,365 intergenic regions that reside immediately upstream of one or more validated yeast genes were assigned as promoters. Relative transcription rates were determined for each yeast gene from transcript levels measured by array and previously collected mRNA half-life data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We found an inverse correlation of -0.39 between the enrichment of promoters in the H3 and H2B ChIP assays and the transcription rates of downstream genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). Under the conditions examined, <italic>PHO5 </italic>is not induced and its promoter has an average nucleosome occupancy according to these datasets. To evaluate further the relationship between nucleosome depletion and transcription, we collated a set of 308 nucleosome-depleted promoters on the basis of their relative depletion across the replicate H3 and H2B experiments. Of these nucleosome-depleted promoters, 42% regulate highly active genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). These data suggest that there is a systematic relationship between promoter strength and nucleosome depletion. However, as this correspondence is not complete there are likely to be other determinants of nucleosome occupancy.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcription factor binding motifs are over-represented in nucleosome-depleted promoters</title><p>To identify additional determinants of occupancy, we sought sequence elements associated with nucleosome depletion. Specifically, we carried out an unbiased search for elements up to 10 bp in length that occur with higher frequency in nucleosome-depleted promoters. Two distinct categories of sequences emerged (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). The first includes poly(dA.dT) elements. Stretches of 10 or more dA.dT nucleotides appear in 38% of depleted promoters, compared with 26% of promoters overall (hypergeometric <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 10<sup>-5</sup>). dA.dT stretches destabilize nucleosome formation <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The enrichment of poly(dA.dT) elements in nucleosome-depleted promoters probably reflects, at least in part, this destabilizing influence. As a high proportion of the poly(dA.dT) elements identified in nucleosome-depleted promoters are more than 10 bp long (30% are at least 14 bp), these data do not address the minimum length required for destabilization. However, <italic>in vitro </italic>studies show that a 16-bp insertion leads to a 1.7-fold increase in accessibility of nucleosomal target sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>The second sequence element enriched in nucleosome-depleted promoters corresponds to the consensus motif for the Rap1 transcription factor. This motif commonly occurs in the promoters of ribosomal proteins genes and is required for Rap1 binding <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Some variant of this motif appears in 22% of nucleosome-depleted promoters, compared with just 8% of promoters overall (hypergeometric <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 10<sup>-5</sup>). Furthermore, multiple Rap1 sites are found in 19% of nucleosome-depleted promoters with Rap1 sites, compared to 8% of promoters with Rap1 sites overall (hypergeometric <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 10<sup>-3</sup>). These data suggest that Rap1 recruitment may lead to nucleosome loss.</p><p>Because only the Rap1 consensus site was identified in an unbiased search, we sought to identify additional sequence motifs by incorporating species conservation data. Specifically, we evaluated a set of 71 conserved motifs identified by Kellis and colleagues, a majority of which function in transcription factor recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Nearly half of these 71 motifs are over-represented in nucleosome-depleted promoters relative to promoters overall, as defined by a hypergeometric <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001. However, many of the implicated motifs appear in the same promoters. For example, nine of the over-represented motifs are associated with filamentation gene promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We therefore considered the possibility that the total number of conserved motifs might be a more relevant predictor of nucleosome depletion. Indeed, we found that 31% of nucleosome-depleted promoters contain at least eight motifs, compared with 11% of promoters overall (hypergeometric <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c;10<sup>-5</sup>; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). Furthermore, nucleosome-depleted promoters contain an average of 6.1 motifs, whereas the average promoter contains 3.1 (permutation <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>). Next, we sought motifs associated with nucleosome depletion in the absence of multiple motifs, by confining our analysis to promoters containing a maximum of four motifs. This analysis identified just two over-represented motifs, which correspond to the Rap1 and Swi4 binding sites. Hence, although a large number of conserved motifs are enriched in nucleosome-depleted promoters, most appear to be relevant mainly when occurring in combination.</p></sec><sec><title>Functionally cooperative transcription factors associate with nucleosome-depleted promoters</title><p>As a majority of the conserved motifs recruit transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], we examined the relationship between transcription factor binding and nucleosome occupancy more directly. Lee and colleagues combined ChIP and microarrays to identify target promoters for essentially all yeast transcription factors under the same conditions used here to evaluate nucleosome occupancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. For each factor, we determined the significance of overlap between its target promoters and the set of nucleosome-depleted promoters. Of the 113 transcription factors in their database, 31 tend to associate with nucleosome-depleted promoters as defined by a hypergeometric <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001. Rap1 has the most significant association (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>), consistent with the enrichment of its binding motif (see above). Other top-ranked factors include Fhl1, which associates with many Rap1-bound promoters, and Swi4, whose binding motif is also enriched (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><p>We sought an underlying binding mechanism or function common to the transcription factors we had identified. However, these factors utilize a variety of binding domains, regulate different pathways, and only a minority have significant associations with promoters of highly active genes. Nonetheless, a commonality does emerge when transcription factor cooperativity is considered. A recent informatics study by Banerjee and Zhang identified 31 functionally cooperative transcription factor pairs (representing a total of 33 factors) on the basis of comprehensive binding and expression data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Only a fraction of these are known to interact physically, suggesting that other mechanisms also confer cooperative function. There is a remarkable correspondence between these functionally cooperative factors and those that preferentially associate with nucleosome-depleted promoters (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Of the 31 factors we found to associate with nucleosome-depleted promoters, 17 were found to be functionally cooperative by Banerjee and Zhang (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 10<sup>-5</sup>). Furthermore, an evaluation of nucleosome occupancy at promoters bound by both members of a cooperative pair revealed a significant association with nucleosome-depletion for 18 of the 31 pairs (hypergeometric <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01). Together, these findings suggest that binding motifs and transcription factors act in combination to deplete nucleosomes and suggest a role for nucleosomes in transcription factor cooperativity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conditional nucleosome depletion at Rap1 consensus motifs</title><p>Although a number of transcription factors appear to act in defining promoter nucleosome occupancy, only the Rap1 consensus motif was identified in an unbiased search of nucleosome-depleted promoters. Furthermore, there is a highly significant association between nucleosome-depleted promoters and promoters bound by this factor <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). To investigate the relationship between Rap1 recruitment and nucleosome depletion further, we used ChIP and real-time PCR to evaluate nucleosome occupancy at several Rap1 binding sites in ribosomal protein promoters. We found that these regions are depleted 3- to 10-fold in H3 and FLAG-H2B ChIP assays, relative to a control promoter (<italic>TUB2</italic>) with average occupancy by global analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). We also used an orthogonal approach in which micrococcal nuclease digestion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] was used to probe for nucleosomes at the <italic>TUB2</italic>, <italic>RPS11B </italic>and <italic>RPS15 </italic>promoters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>). A pattern of nuclease protection indicative of a regular nucleosome array is evident at the <italic>TUB2 </italic>promoter, consistent with the average nucleosome occupancy attributed to this promoter by global ChIP analysis. In contrast, nuclease protection is not evident at the RAP1 sites in the <italic>RPS15 </italic>promoter, consistent with the marked nucleosome-depletion attributed to this region by global ChIP and real-time PCR analysis. The region surrounding the RAP1 sites in <italic>RPS11B </italic>exhibits weak nuclease protection, consistent with the modest nucleosome-depletion attributed to this region by global ChIP and real-time PCR. Although these focused analyses specifically addressed Rap1 sites in ribosomal protein genes, our global analyses indicate that approximately 30% of nucleosome-depleted promoters containing Rap1 motifs do not regulate ribosomal protein genes. Together these data confirm that nucleosomes are markedly depleted in the vicinity of Rap1 consensus sites <italic>in vivo</italic>, and thus extend previous studies showing that Rap1 induces local alterations in chromatin structure that, for example, result in increased nuclease sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>To gain further insight into the relationship between Rap1 and nucleosome depletion, we examined a mutant <italic>RPS11B </italic>promoter lacking its Rap1 consensus sites. We found that removal of these sites, which completely abrogates Rap1 binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], causes nucleosomes to return to the region, as reflected by a greater than twofold change in H3 ChIP enrichment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>). We also examined the effect of rapamycin treatment on nucleosome occupancy in the vicinity of these consensus sites. Although ribosomal protein gene expression is dramatically reduced by rapamycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], Rap1 remains bound to its target promoters ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], and B.B., E.P. and S.S., unpublished results). We found that rapamycin treatment causes nucleosomes to return to the vicinity of Rap1 sites, as reflected by twofold and greater increases in H3 ChIP enrichment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4e</xref>). Together these data show that Rap1 consensus sites are required for conditional nucleosome depletion at ribosomal protein gene promoters.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>To gain further insight into the role of nucleosomes in gene regulation, we systematically evaluated promoter nucleosome occupancy in yeast by immunoprecipitating nucleosomal DNA and quantifying enrichment with microarrays. Promoters that are inefficiently immunoprecipitated by general anti-histone antibodies, and are therefore presumed to be relatively nucleosome-depleted, tend to regulate active genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This is consistent with the previous observation that the activated <italic>PHO5 </italic>promoter is largely devoid of nucleosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, as not all nucleosome-depleted promoters regulate active genes, there are most likely to be additional determinants of depletion. An unbiased search for sequence elements enriched in nucleosome-depleted promoters revealed poly(dA.dT) elements, previously shown to destabilize nucleosome formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and the Rap1 consensus motif. By incorporating sequence conservation data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], more than 30 other enriched motifs could be identified. However, most of these appear to be relevant mainly when occurring in combination. When we limited this analysis to promoters containing four or fewer motifs, all but two of these additional motifs drop out (only the Rap1 and Swi4 consensus sites remain). As the majority of conserved motifs incorporated in this analysis recruit transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], these data suggest that multiple transcription factors act in combination to deplete nucleosomes. This possibility is further supported by our finding that functionally cooperative transcription factors tend to bind nucleosome-depleted promoters. These associations may reflect a mechanistic model in which transcription factors compete collaboratively to displace nucleosomes in order to gain access to target sites in the DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This model was formulated to explain why certain pairs of transcription factors bind cooperatively to proximal target sites <italic>in vivo </italic>and on a chromatin template, but not to naked DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This view invokes a broad role for nucleosomes as ubiquitous negative regulators of transcription factor binding and function. We speculate that by promoting synergy among multiple transcription factors and impeding the activities of individual ones, nucleosomes facilitate threshold behavior and filter noise (for example, genetic variation in motif sequence) in the transcriptional regulatory network.</p><p>Although many factors appear to act in defining promoter nucleosome occupancy, our data indicate that Rap1 has a uniquely important role. Rap1 and its consensus motif are both markedly enriched in nucleosome-depleted promoters. Follow-up studies using real-time PCR and micrococcal nuclease digestion also demonstrate marked nucleosome depletion in the vicinity of Rap1 sites in the promoters of ribosomal protein genes. Moreover, nucleosomes appeared to return when the Rap1 consensus sites in one of these promoters were removed. These findings are consistent with previously described roles for Rap1 in opening chromatin and altering nucleosome positioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, Rap1 recruitment is not equally associated with nucleosome depletion under all conditions. We find that nucleosomes partially return to the vicinity of Rap1 sites during a rapamycin-induced starvation response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], even though Rap1 remains bound ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], and B.B, E.P. and S.S., unpublished results). Hence, the nucleosome loss associated with Rap1 recruitment is most likely to require additional proteins, such as Esa1, a histone acetyltransferase recruited by Rap1 under exponential growth conditions but released in stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>These findings may also offer insight into the barrier activity previously documented for Rap1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Heterochromatin propagation involves the sequential modification of histones in adjacent nucleosomes through positive-feedback mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Certain factors such as Rap1 are able to block this propagation by largely unknown mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. One model speculates that these barriers create nucleosome-free 'holes' lacking the histone substrate required for heterochromatin propagation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. By identifying such a 'hole' in the vicinity of Rap1-binding sites <italic>in vivo </italic>our data support this model. Remarkably, the nucleosomal hole and the barrier function ascribed to Rap1 may be conditional, as nucleosomes return following treatment with the small molecule rapamycin, which activates a starvation response. Heterochromatic silencing has been shown previously to moderate under these conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Hence, we speculate that dynamic influences on nucleosome occupancy may enable Rap1 to define chromatin domains and vary them in response to environmental cues.</p><p>More broadly, the widespread nucleosome loss observed in the promoters of active genes provides a general caveat for ChIP studies examining posttranslational histone modifications, as a decrease in signal for a histone modification at a promoter undergoing activation may actually reflect nucleosome loss. Similarly, regions that appear relatively hypo-modified by ChIP may actually be nucleosome-depleted. However, this is not the case for low levels of acetylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and H3 lysine 4 methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] observed at yeast telomeres, as these regions have high occupancy. The data also provide insight into the maintenance of epigenetic information by histone modifications. Whereas epigenetic memory of a repressed state can be maintained on histones in promoters, memory of an activated state must be maintained on histones outside the promoters, for example in transcribed regions, which may not undergo significant nucleosome loss during activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].

Briefly, 45 ml log-phase w303a yeast (OD<sub>600 </sub>~ 1.0) growing in yeast extract/peptone/dextrose (YPD) were cross-linked in 1% formaldehyde for 15 min, washed twice in PBS, resuspended in 400 &#x003bc;l lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes-KOH pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate) and lysed with glass beads. The resulting extract was sonicated to fragment chromatin (4 &#x000d7; 20 sec burst/30 sec rest with a Branson Sonifier 250 at 70% duty, power 3) and centrifuged for 15 min. Solubilized chromatin was then immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies against the carboxy terminus of histone H3 (Abcam or Cell Signaling). A unenriched whole-cell extract sample (WCE) was also retained as a control.

Correlations between replicate datasets were ~0.8 for all experiments. Composite datasets were log<sub>2 </sub>transformed and zero centered before further analysis. The histone H3 ChIP dataset was determined from four independent immunoprecipitations and hybridizations (two each using antibodies from Cell Signaling or Abcam). The FLAG-H2B ChIP dataset was determined from three independent immunoprecipitations and hybridizations. The mRNA dataset was determined from three independent extractions and hybridizations of mRNA against genomic DNA. Relative transcription rates were determined by dividing transcript levels by half-life data collected by Wang and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].
