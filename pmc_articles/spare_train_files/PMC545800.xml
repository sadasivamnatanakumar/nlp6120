In addition to sequence homology and annotation transfer considerations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], these function assignments increasingly rely on algorithms that recognize protein-sequence features responsible for posttranslational modifications, subcellular localization and interactions with specific domains of other proteins.</p><p>Although considerable effort has been invested in achieving low false-positive prediction rates, our experience with tools for recognizing glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) lipid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and myristoyl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] anchor attachment sites and for predicting potential targets for PTS1-dependent translocation to peroxisomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] shows that a small but noticeable number of proteins without appropriate biological context (for example with contradictory subcellular localization or in taxa without the modifying enzyme or receptor) are systematically hit by these tools. For example, we found more than a dozen metazoan lysozymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], known extracellular proteins, that are predicted to have carboxyl termini with a functional peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (PTS1) region.</p><p>Are these false-positive predictions? All three of the sequence-analysis tools mentioned above check query sequences for a recognition pattern that is explicitly described in terms of its physical properties and it is possible to check the concordance between pattern descriptions and query sequence individually. Nevertheless, this visual inspection is frequently unable to rationalize the findings as false-positive predictions, as all known components of the pattern appear to be present. Even in the case of high accuracy of the prediction tool, an erroneous prediction cannot be excluded. Alternatively, these predicted sequence motifs may occur by chance and be functional in an appropriate test system, but still have no biological meaning because the necessary cellular context is absent <italic>in vivo</italic>. Only experimental tests can resolve this contradiction. As a case study, we report the results of an experimental analysis that demonstrates the existence of naturally occurring peroxisomal targeting signals in several known non-peroxisomal proteins. We also discuss the evolutionary perspective of functional localization signals in unrelated proteins as well as the consequences for experimental localization determination and function prediction from sequence.</p><p>The major mechanism for targeting proteins to the matrix of peroxisomes, which are membrane-bounded organelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] of eukaryotic cells, is initiated in the cytoplasm by interaction of the receptor protein peroxin 5 (PEX5) with the carboxy-terminal signal PTS1 on the target protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This signal consists of three regions of sequence comprising approximately 12 residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It is composed of the most carboxy-terminal tripeptide (classically, the -SKL terminus), preceded by a region of around four residues (which interact with the surface at the mouth of the PEX5 binding cavity), and a solvent-accessible (or easily unfoldable) stretch of around five residues further upstream. The PTS1-prediction program 'PTS1' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] identifies PTS1 signals in query protein sequences by evaluating their carboxy-terminal ends with respect to features necessary for interaction with the tetratricopeptide repeats of PEX5. The predictor's scoring function searching for this motif within the 12 carboxy-terminal residues achieves an estimated sensitivity of 90% and a selectivity above 99% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The carboxyl termini of several non-peroxisomal proteins interact with PEX5</title><p>Screening of SWISS-PROT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] entries with the PTS1 predictor identified proteins from several families that are clearly not peroxisomal but score highly and are predicted as PEX5 targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. We were not able to rationalize these results as false predictions as the proteins' carboxyl termini did not deviate from the generalized PTS1 sequence pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. To verify whether these proteins could indeed interact with PEX5, we tested the carboxyl termini of seven representative proteins in a yeast two-hybrid system: hen egg-white lysozyme (P00698, secreted); dog lysozyme C from milk (P81708); tyrosinase from human (P14679, a melanosomal type I membrane protein); frog tyrosinase (Q04604); <italic>Drosophila </italic>sevenless (P13368, a large transmembrane protein required for photoreceptor development); precursor of lysosomal bovine cathepsin D (P80209); and a mitochondrial ribosomal protein from yeast (P12687). We also examined the carboxyl terminus of a mouse dihydrofolate reductase construct with an added SKL peptide, which has been shown not to be imported into yeast peroxisomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Depending on their taxonomic origin, the carboxyl termini of the eukaryotic sequences were assayed for interaction with the tetratricopeptide repeat domains of either human or yeast PEX5 using published methodologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The query sequences, along with prediction scores and measured &#x003b2;-galactosidase activities, are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. The results show that all peptide sequences interact with the PTS1-receptor PEX5 in the two-hybrid system. Hence, the carboxy-terminal sequences of these assayed non-peroxisomal proteins fulfill the requirements to function as PTS1 signals.</p></sec><sec><title>The accessibility of the PTS1-like carboxyl terminus is critical</title><p>The fact that the peroxisomal translocation machinery fails to import naturally occurring mature proteins carrying PTS1 signals into peroxisomes <italic>in vivo </italic>could be explained by the non-accessibility of their carboxyl termini. These could either be hidden in the native structure of the mature protein or of its functional complexes, or competing translocation machineries could lead to a removal of the respective proteins from the cytosol before their recognition by PEX5.</p><p>The first possibility is exemplified by DHFR-SKL. The carboxy-terminal 16 residues of the DHFR-SKL construct (EKGIKYKFEVYEK<bold>SKL</bold>, sequences appended to DHFR are in bold type, see results in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) interact with yeast PEX5 in the two-hybrid test but <italic>in vivo </italic>the complete construct is not imported into peroxisomes, thus confirming the prediction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. For comparison, it should be noted that two other DHFR-derived constructs with slightly longer carboxyl termini (IKYKFEVYEK<bold>GGKSKL </bold>and IKYKFEVYEK<bold>KNIESKL</bold>) are predicted to be peroxisomally targeted. Their scores calculated with the PTS1 predictor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] are 13.2 and 9.9, respectively (compare with data in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). They were experimentally shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] to be translocated to peroxisomes. In the native three-dimensional structure of DHFR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], the carboxyl terminus is part of a &#x003b2;-sheet that is buried in the fold, deprived of flexibility and accessibility. Seemingly, this structure prevents the carboxy-terminal appended residues SKL in the construct from entering the PEX5 binding cavity, whereas slightly longer carboxyl termini may do. In our two-hybrid test system, the carboxy-terminal 16-mers are always considered exposed as, in the non-native sequence environment of the carboxyl terminus of the GAL4 activation domain, they are free from interfering or blocking structural features. Thus, DHFR-SKL fails to be imported into peroxisomes because its carboxyl terminus is sequestered in the structure of the mature protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing targeting signals prevent translocation into peroxisomes despite the presence of PTS1-like carboxyl termini</title><p>Alternatively, functional PTS1 signals can be overruled by other localization signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. For instance, distribution of the mammalian alanine-glyoxylate amino transferase (AGT) between peroxisomes and mitochondria is regulated by the variable occurrence of an amino-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal in the mature protein (depending on the usage of two alternative transcription initiation sites) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Does a naturally occurring PTS1-like carboxyl terminus of a clearly non-peroxisomal protein that is capable of interacting with PEX5 indeed lead to <italic>in vivo </italic>import of the respective protein, provided that a potentially overruling sequence signal is eliminated? A set of three target proteins with amino-terminal leader sequences was chosen from Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Chicken lysozyme (SWISS-PROT id P00698), a secreted enzyme, is one of the best characterized proteins and has an apparently accessible carboxyl terminus as deduced from its three-dimensional structure (Protein Data Bank (PDB) number 1H6M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]). The corresponding carboxy-terminal 16-mer produces moderate &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity in the yeast two-hybrid assay (most of the other proteins in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> appear to interact even more strongly with PEX5). Human tyrosinase (P14679) is a melanosomal marker protein that functions in the formation of pigments such as melanins. Yeast 60S ribosomal protein L2 (P12687), or MRP7, is a component of the large subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome.</p><p>Green fluorescent protein (GFP) was appended to the amino terminus of each of the selected proteins. It can be assumed that translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or mitochondria is disrupted by the resulting shift of the signal peptide from the amino terminus to the center of the protein. The resulting molecules are expected to be redirected into peroxisomes if their carboxyl termini can act as PTS1 signals. Targeting of the GFP-constructs <italic>in vivo </italic>was indeed confirmed by co-localization with a peroxisomal DsRed2-SKL construct in COS7 cells for the metazoan enzymes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and with DsRed-SKL in yeast cells for the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Thus, the PTS1 signals at the carboxyl termini of the assayed proteins are normally suppressed by alternative amino-terminal targeting sequences. A similar mechanism can be inferred for other eukaryotic SWISS-PROT proteins listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, although steric carboxy-terminal accessibility or other factors might also play a role.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional PTS1 sequences can occur in organisms without peroxisomes</title><p>The occurrence of silent PTS1s without a targeting role raises the question of whether such signals can also evolve in organisms that do not carry peroxisomes. To test this hypothesis, we extended Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> with a set of four predicted carboxyl termini from prokaryotic enzymes: <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>glutamate-1-semialdehyde 2,1-aminomutase (P23893), <italic>E. coli </italic>transaldolase A (P78258), <italic>Methanopyrus kandleri </italic>riboflavin synthase (NCBI-Refseq accession NP_613646) and <italic>Archaeoglobus fulgidus </italic>2-nitropropane dioxygenase (NCBI-Refseq accession NP_070998). Indeed, these proteins harbor carboxyl termini that qualify as PTS1 signals (lower part of table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). As confirmation, for the bacterial protein glutamate-1-semialdehyde 2,1-aminomutase (GSA) we used the same methodology for subcellular localization determination as for yeast MRP7. The resulting GFP-GSA construct is also imported into peroxisomes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), demonstrating that its PTS1-like carboxyl terminus is functional in the mature protein.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In families of orthologous proteins, peroxisomal location and its targeting signal in the amino-acid sequence are not necessarily conserved. For example, in plants the five enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle are localized to peroxisomes, but in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>three of the five (aconitase, isocitrate lyase, and the respective malate dehydrogenase isoform) could not be found in peroxisomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Thus, it is not surprising to find sporadically occurring PTS1 signals in protein families (see some examples in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><p>In dually localized proteins such as AGT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], the PTS1 signal has a biological role as a targeting signal. However, the carboxyl termini of the proteins from Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> do not seem to fulfill any specific targeting function. We suggest that these PTS1 signals occur as a result of neutral mutation. The presence of a functional PTS1 signal would not lead to evolutionary pressure in this context because mislocalization is prevented by overriding the function of these sequences either by alternative exposure of amino-terminal signals or by steric carboxy-terminal inaccessibility.</p><p>The case of lysozyme is particularly noteworthy because a large number of homologous proteins were systematically hit when performing a SWISS-PROT screen using the prediction tool (30 cases with putative PTS1s and 46 other lysozyme carboxyl termini are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Because of the close relationship of the originating species and the occurrence of several isozymes, the lysozyme sequences in the multiple alignment share a high degree of similarity. The PTS1 carboxyl termini seem to be a mimicry of the sequence needed to support structural features of the protein. The cysteine at the antepenultimate position, which is present as part of a disulfide bridge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] in the final secreted form of lysozyme, happens to fulfill the need for a small residue at the respective PTS1 location. The PTS1 is mostly functional, with a positively charged or amidic penultimate amino acid and the correct hydrophobic carboxy-terminal residue, which is the case for a large proportion of the lysozymes. Note that the disulfide bridge will not be formed in our GFP-lysozyme test case because translocation of the fusion protein into the endoplasmic reticulum is prevented.</p><p>We conclude that a PEX5-interacting sequence can evolve simply by mutational alterations in the carboxy-terminal region of a protein. Although shuffling of a carboxy-terminal exon cannot be excluded for other examples, the fact that the open reading frames (ORFs) of the carboxy-terminal exons for human tyrosinase (GenBank accession AP000720.4), fly sevenless (GenBank accession AE003484.2) and chicken lysozyme (GenBank accession AF410481.1) reach far into the functional domains of their proteins, rather supports an evolutionary mechanism of several point substitutions. The occurrence of functional PTS1 sequences in non-eukaryotic species further supports a stochastic model for the evolution of PEX5-interacting protein carboxyl termini.</p><p>In non-globular regions of proteins, sequences that code for targeting to other subcellular compartments, or for posttranslational modifications, might appear in similar ways during evolution. For example, the sequence motif coding for amino-terminal <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation of glycines behaves as an exchangeable functional module, as protein families do exist where it has been substituted by alternative sequence determinants that facilitate membrane association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This is exemplified by the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>Rab5 ortholog Ara7 and its paralog Ara6. Ara7 is geranylgeranylated on carboxy-terminal cysteines just as Rab5 is in other species. However, the closely related paralog Ara6 lacks the carboxy-terminal cysteines and has an experimentally verified amino-terminal myristoylation motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Many of these signals seem to remain silent under normal physiological conditions (as is the case for the PTS1 signal in some metazoan lysozymes) but have the potential to become important in some future evolutionary scenarios or in pathological situations. Alternatively, the PTS1 signal might have become obsolete and the corresponding sequence segment is now subject to evolutionary alterations. Apparently, the cell exploits only a fraction of the potential molecular capabilities of its proteins.</p><p>Futhermore, subcellular targeting is organized in a hierarchy of cellular recognition mechanisms. The co-translational sorting into the ER serves as a first decision node. Posttranslational processes such as interaction with chaperones, folding, and covalent modifications are concomitant with the appropriate exposure of targeting signals. The amino-terminal signals are made first and are therefore favored when it comes to recognition by receptors. PEX5 needs only to categorize the remaining unsorted proteins with accessible carboxyl termini into 'stay here' or 'let's go into peroxisomes'. This might also explain why the PTS1 signal is comparatively short and permissive for a wide range of residues.</p><p>Clearly, the fact that functional sequences for subcellular targeting occur in unrelated proteins needs to be considered for prediction-tool development. The construction of a negative learning set (sequences without the specific localization signal) on the basis of proteins with differing cellular localization is problematic. For example, a set of non-peroxisomal but organellar localized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], viral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] or bacterial sequences might contain a considerable number of proteins that potentially interact with PEX5. Thus, such a set does not directly qualify for automated learning procedures or the assessment of false-positive prediction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Surprisingly, when Maurer-Stroh and Eisenhaber applied their myristoylation site predictor for eukaryotic proteins to bacterial proteomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], systematic hits were found despite the absence of known amino-terminal <italic>N</italic>-myristoyltransferases (NMT) in bacteria. Are these false-positive predictions? A literature search revealed that myristoylation by host NMTs has physiological relevance for several secreted proteins of intracellular bacterial parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Thus, the sequence motif coding for amino-terminal <italic>N</italic>-myristoylation is typical for eukaryotes but occurs also in bacteria. In many cases, it remains without phenotypic effect for bacteria but may become evolutionarily important in the case of host-parasite interactions.</p><p>In the case of the endothelin-converting enzyme 1 and the neprilysin-like zinc metallopeptidase family, the carboxy-terminal CXAW motif is a valid prenylation motif. This carboxy-terminus is functionally hidden because the protein is exported to the extracellular side of the cytomembrane and the carboxy-terminal residues are apparently involved in folding and enzyme function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Clearly, the accessibility of the recognition motif in the substrate protein to the respective receptor or protein-modifying enzyme is a major issue. For PTS1 signal prediction from the amino-acid sequence, carboxy-terminal exposure needs to be assessed both from the steric point of view as well as in the context of competing translocation mechanisms. Analyzing only the carboxy-terminal dodecamer peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] might not suffice for reliable prediction of accessibility to the receptor, but a full solution would require sufficiently accurate three-dimensional structure prediction.</p><p>In databases, it should also be routine to flag proteins that contain several competing targeting signals with differing priority. Finally, silent localization signals might become active in mutant protein constructs and lead to non-native localizations, an issue that needs to be assessed especially in localization screens of proteins with uniformly incorporated fluorescent dyes such as GFP. It cannot be excluded that the subcellular location of a considerable number of proteins has not been correctly determined in published large-scale studies that rely on this methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>To conclude, sequence segments coding for subcellular targeting or for posttranslational modifications can occur in proteins that are not substrates in either of these processes. Accurate prediction techniques reveal candidate proteins carrying hidden sequence signals. Many of these can be experimentally confirmed. In the case of the PTS1 predictor program, there is no reasonable argument to assume a difference in prediction accuracies for real and hidden PTS1s as, in both cases, productive interaction of the carboxyl terminus with PEX5 is the criterion for a functional PTS1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cloning procedures</title><p>Oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG Biotech (Munich, Germany).

Yeast transformants were selected and grown on minimum medium containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen bases without amino acids (Difco Laboratories), 2% glucose and amino acids (20-150 &#x003bc;g/ml) as required (SC-leu-ura). For fluorescence microscopy, yeast cells were grown at 30&#x000b0;C with shaking in selective media with 0.5% glucose as sole carbon source until the glucose concentration was very low (0.05%, usually 16 h), harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in the original volume of induction medium containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen bases without amino acids, 0.1% yeast extract, 30 mM potassium phosphate pH 6.0, 0.125% oleate, 0.2% Tween-80 and amino acids as required. Cells were grown for 16 h in induction medium and observed live for fluorescence. Briefly, cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice in water. Cell pellets were resuspended in induction medium without oleate and aliquots were spotted onto multitest slides (ICN Biochemicals) previously coated with concanavalin A (6 mg/ml, Sigma). Cells were allowed to attach for 5 min at room temperature and the slides were washed twice with induction medium and a coverslip applied for observation. Fluorescence was viewed with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope using a 63 &#x000d7; (1.4 NA) lens. Digital images were captured with a Quantix CCD camera using Lightview software without further modification. The pictures were mounted and false-color overlays were made in Adobe Photoshop.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We wish to acknowledge the skilled technical assistance of Michael Schuster (Medical University, Vienna) and Peter Steinlein (Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna) as well as Sebastian Maurer-Stroh (Institute of Molecular Pathology, Vienna) for helpful literature suggestions.

Separate small images of the GFP fluorescence (green) and DsRed2 fluorescence (red) are shown to the left of each main picture, in which the two fluorescent images are overlaid. Areas in which red and green fluorescence coincide show as yellow. (a) Control experiments reveal that expression of GFP-lysozyme is an adjunct to the cellular punctuate fluorescence pattern independently of the presence of DsRed2-SKL. The figures show a punctate fluorescence pattern for GFP fusions with (b) human tyrosinase and (c) chicken lysozyme. Both proteins co-localize with DsRed2-SKL in human peroxisomes as demonstrated by the fluorescence overlay. Owing to the evolutionary conservation of PEX5 within the metazoans [7,13,33], a chicken protein (lysozyme) can be assayed in a human cell line and the species barrier is not an issue in this study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gb-2004-5-12-r97-1"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Targeting of GFP-MRP7 and GFP-GSA to peroxisomes in yeast cells.

A screen of the SWISS-PROT database [15] for proteins that harbour PTS1 signals produced a set of lyosozymes, well characterized secreted enzymes that are not usually found in peroxisomes. Rather than occurring sporadically, a large fraction of the known sequences from this family was obtained using the PTS1 prediction tool [7]. Moreover, these hits could not be rationalized as false positives as they did not deviate from the PTS1 sequence motif [11-13]. The multiple alignment shows intact vertebrate lysozyme carboxy-terminal 20-mers (with accession number and species name) retrieved from the SWISS-PROT database. From a total of 76 entries, 23 have predicted PTS1s (score &#x0003e; 0; at the top, marked with '+'), seven are in the twilight zone (-10 &#x0003c; score &#x0003c; 0; in the middle, marked with '#') and 46 are not predicted (score &#x0003c; -10; at the bottom, marked with '-'). There appears to be an overlap between the PTS1 motif and sequence variability within the lysozyme family. For example, the absolutely conserved cysteine near the carboxyl terminus is needed for the formation of a disulfide bridge in the mature protein [21]. This cysteine also meets the requirement for a small residue at the antepenultimate position of the PTS1 sequence.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gb-2004-5-12-r97-3"/></fig><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Results of the yeast-two hybrid interaction assays with PEX5</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td></td><td align="center" colspan="3">Yeast PEX5</td><td align="center" colspan="3">Human PEX5</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td colspan="6"><hr></hr></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Species</td><td align="center">Accession</td><td align="center">Score*</td><td align="center">Activity<sup>&#x02020;

The prokaryotic proteins were assayed using PEX5 from both yeast and human. As the estimated length of the PTS1 signal is 12 carboxy-terminal residues [13], we chose the carboxy-terminal 16-mers to be sure that we have included the complete motif-carrying segment. *A PTS1 prediction score above zero is considered predictive of a functional PTS1 signal; a score between -10 and 0 is considered a 'twilight zone' prediction. It should be noted that the negative score for the DHFR-SKL carboxyl terminus in its context is generated by the PTS1 predictor [7] solely by terms that evaluate its potential accessibility for PEX5. <sup>&#x02020;</sup>A yeast-two hybrid assay is considered positive if the measured &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity is clearly greater than zero. Experience from previous test series suggests a lower limit of around 10 Miller Units per mg protein [12] for the detection of a productive interaction. The measured &#x003b2;-galactosidase activities (including standard deviations) range from weak (P81708, P13368) to strong (P80209, P12687).</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Oligonucleotides used for the amplification of the GFP-constructs</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Construct</td><td align="left">Forward primer</td><td align="left">Reverse primer</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">EGFP-tyrosinase</td><td align="left">GAATTCAATGCTCCTGGCTGTTTTGTACTG</td><td align="left">GGATCCTTATAAATGGCTCTGATACAAGCTG</td></tr><tr><td align="left">EGFP-lysozyme</td><td align="left">GAATTCCATGAGGTCTTTGCTAATCTTGGT</td><td align="left">GGATCCGGCAGCTCCTCACAGCCG</td></tr><tr><td align="left">GFP-MRP7</td><td align="left">CGGGATCCAATGTGGAATCCTATTTTACTAGATAC</td><td align="left">GGGCATGCTCAAAGCTTGCTCAAAAAAGCCCG</td></tr><tr><td align="left">GFP-GSA</td><td align="left">CGGGATCCAATGAGGAAGTCTGAAAATCTTTACCAG</td><td align="left">GGGCATGCTCACAACTTCGCAAACACCCGACG</td></tr><tr><td align="left">DsRed2-SKL (COS7 cells)</td><td align="left">CGGCTAGCGCTACCGGTCGCCACCATGGCC</td><td align="left">CGTCTCGAGTTATAATTTGGACAGGTGGTGGCGGCC</td></tr><tr><td align="left">DsRed-SKL (yeast cells)</td><td align="left">AGATCTATGGTGAGGTCTTCCAAG</td><td align="left">CTGCAGTTATAATTTGGATAGGATCCCAAGGAACAGATGGTGGCG</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec></back></article>
