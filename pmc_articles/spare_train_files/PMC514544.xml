Even if the pathological, electrical and physiological phenomena leading to AF have been described in ever more detail, the mechanisms underlying these changes remain largely unknown. The relative occurrences of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) and other forms of this arrhythmia in the population are also not well known. In a material based on hospital observations, 35% of all fibrillation was described as being of paroxysmal type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Despite being common, surprisingly limited information about possible triggering factors and symptoms at the onset of arrhythmia in larger groups of patients is available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Our aim in this investigation was to throw further light on the factors believed by patients to have caused their arrhythmia and on the symptoms experienced at the onset of attacks of AF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A group of one hundred patients suffering ECG-verified PAF and whose symptoms prompted hospital care were asked to fill in a structured questionnaire with 58 questions covering arrhythmia-triggering factors, time at which the attack starts and symptoms during attack. All patients completed the data by personal interviews by one of the authors. The vast majority of all patients were recruited during two periods of totally 14 months. In some questions, extra information could be supplied by the patients in their own words. (The complete questionnaire could be seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">additional file 1</xref>: AHansson_enkat.pdf). All patients had earlier had attacks of AF which stopped either spontaneously or following medication. Most of them had earlier been treated in hospital for the arrhythmia. Patients who previously had myocardial infarction, pericarditis, diseases of the thyroid or diabetes were not included since these diseases may be the underlying cause of the arrhythmia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Our group of patients thus had idiopathic PAF. Permission for the investigation was obtained from the local Ethical Committee and all patients were informed about the investigation both orally and in writing.</p><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>Data were compared using Fisher's Exact Test and Mann Whitney U-test.

Twenty-four of these had on some occasion been treated for hypertension. The median (range) age of the entire group was 59.9 (22.4&#x02013;79.2) years. Patients with previous histories of hypertension were significantly older than those without 65.0 (46.6&#x02013;78.6) years as against 58.6 (22.4&#x02013;79.2) years respectively. The women in the group were significantly older than the men 67.9 (54.1&#x02013;78.6) years and 58.2 (22.4&#x02013;79.2) years respectively, p = 0.02 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Since patients with hypertension differed from the others only as regards age, the ensuing analyses were made without respect to its incidence. Seventy six of all patients were given genuine antiarrhythmic drugs, sotalol being the most common. Twenty four of the patients were not taking any antiarrhythmic pharmacological treatment (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Age-distribution by sex. </bold>In the group investigated, the median age was 59.9 (22.4&#x02013;79.2) years median (range).

Some patients named more than one kind of alcohol as a triggering factor. Two of those who reacted to red wine did not drink spirits and hence could not say whether spirits, too, trigger arrhythmia. In the alcohol-triggered group, red wine and spirits triggered more episodes of arrhythmia than white wine (p = 0.01 and p = 0.05 respectively). There were no significant differences in the arrhythmia-provoking effects of spirits and red wine nor between men and women (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).

This study has therefore been undertaken to determine which factors patients consider responsible for triggering arrhythmia and the symptoms that occur in connection with episodes of arrhythmia.</p><sec><title>What provokes arrhythmia?</title><p>From observations of heart-rate in sinus rhythm shortly before its onset, a separation of PAF into sympathetically-mediated and vagal forms has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Earlier studies have shown a degree of daily variation in the onset of AF. Thus, attacks are more common in the morning and at night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], but higher frequency has also been reported during daytime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A possible explanation is that arrhythmia often starts in younger patients at night and in older ones during the day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. A weekly variation has also been reported, with fewer attacks on Saturdays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. An annual variation with fewer attacks during the last months of the year has also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>In our study, the 72 patients who thought that their attacks of arrhythmia usually occurred at about the same time of day gave this as the evening or at night. Hence a large fraction of those investigated should have vagal PAF since this often starts at night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Despite this, the majority of the patients considered that the triggering-factor was some kind of situation in which increased levels of catecholamines can be discerned. Even those with positive stress-related anamnesis (triggered by physical exertion and psychic stress) had often attacks starting in the evening or at night. However, this need not imply an absolute correlation in time, but rather the probable existence of a certain latent period between stress and the onset of arrhythmia. In earlier studies, it has been proposed that attacks of PAF are often due to variations in the tonus of the autonomic nervous system. Arrhythmia is stimulated particularly when an initial adrenergic increase is followed by an abrupt change to vagal dominance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Alcohol has long been considered to play an etiological role in PAF, a correlation underlined in the expression "holiday heart" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Since temporary enhanced alcohol consumption is frequent, it is difficult to prove a direct correlation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Episodes of AF have been triggered by the acute effects of alcohol on atrial refractoriness and conduction, but also by the effects of chronic misuse of alcohol leading to subclinical heart dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Other mechanisms have also been discussed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Every third patient in our study considered alcohol to be a triggering-factor, but white wine was blamed less than red wine and spirits. Why arrhythmia should be triggered less frequently by white wine than by red wine or spirits remains unclear.</p><p>It is now generally accepted that most attacks of PAF are induced by ectopic impulses originating in the pulmonary veins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Both automaticity and triggered automaticity in these cells have been demonstrated in experimental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The influence of the autonomic nervous system, alcohol and other factors inducing arrhythmia on this mechanism is, however, uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Symptoms at the onset of fibrillation</title><p>Although a number of patients with PAF are without any symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], in general patients with this form of arrhythmia show more symptoms than those with permanent AF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Studies with telephone-transmitted ECG have, however, shown a sensitivity of symptomatic registrations of up to 89% with PAF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. There is thus good correlation between the symptoms and ECG-verified AF.</p><p>The limited amount of literature on the symptomology of PAF includes Quality of Life investigations, Case Reports and quantification of a few symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Investigations based on "Quality of Life" forms have earlier shown that patients with PAF have lower scores for physical function, emotional function, vitality and general health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The symptoms commonly reported include palpitations, giddiness, dyspnoea, tachycardia, perspiring, chest pains, coldness, anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], tiredness, weakness, indisposition, vomiting and epigastrical discomfort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>The most frequent symptoms in periods of AF reported by our group of patients included palpitations, reduced physical performance, palpitations when at rest, breathlessness when exerting oneself and anxiety. In an earlier report, the most pronounced symptoms were palpitations and anxiety as well as giddiness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. That females showed significantly higher frequencies of swollen legs, indisposition and anxiety than males has not previously been reported. These differences can possibly be accounted for since earlier studies have reported that attacks of AF in women last longer and cause higher heart-rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We could not, however, establish any significant differences in the lengths of attacks between men and women in our material.</p><p>Swollen legs can also be accounted for due to right-sided cardiac failure in some patients. That most patients experience definite symptoms following acute but transient attacks of AF can possibly depend on the increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system triggered by an attack of AF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].
