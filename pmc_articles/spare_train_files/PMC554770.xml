In soybeans (a dicotyledonous legume), the <italic>vspA </italic>and <italic>B </italic>genes encode subunits of a dimeric vegetative storage protein that plays an important role in nitrogen storage in vegetative tissues. Similar genes are found in monocots; however, they do not accumulate in leaves as storage proteins, and the ability of monocot leaves to support accumulation of an ectopically expressed soybean VSP is in question. To test this, transgenic maize (<italic>Zea Mays </italic>L. Hi-II hybrid) lines were created expressing soybean <italic>vspB </italic>from a maize ubiquitin <italic>Ubi-1 </italic>promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>From 81 bombardments, 101 plants were regenerated, and plants from five independent lines produced <italic>vspB </italic>transcripts and VSP&#x003b2; polypeptides. In leaves from seven-week-old plants (prior to flowering), VSP&#x003b2; accumulated to 0.5% of the soluble leaf protein in primary transgenic plants (R<sub>0</sub>), but to only 0.03% in R<sub>1 </sub>plants. During seed-filling (silage-stage) in R<sub>1 </sub>plants, the VSP&#x003b2; protein was no longer detected in leaves and stems despite continued presence of the <italic>vspB </italic>RNA. The RNA transcripts for this peptide either became less efficiently translated, or the VSP&#x003b2; protein became unstable during seed-fill.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Developmental differences in the accumulation of soybean VSP&#x003b2; when transgenically expressed in maize show that despite no changes in the <italic>vspB </italic>transcript level, VSP&#x003b2; protein that is readily detected in leaves of preflowering plants, becomes undetectable as seeds begin to develop.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Although genetic variation for protein content has been found in forage plants, this variability is narrower than that observed for other traits such as digestibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Since the major protein components in monocot forage and silage crops are involved in metabolic activity, and hence are not "true" storage proteins, it has been argued that it is not feasible to make major changes in protein quality or protein composition by conventional breeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. However, genetic engineering may allow improvement in protein quality and content through expression of a storage protein not found in grass vegetative tissue.</p><p>Genes encoding seed storage proteins of various plant species have been transgenically expressed to test for improvement of nutritional quality. Most experiments were conducted with tobacco and legume species including alfalfa, soybean, canola, clover and lupins. For nuclear-targeted genes, accumulation of these seed storage proteins in vegetative tissue of transgenic plants was either undetectable or very low. These included pea vicilin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], soybean conglycinin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], sunflower seed agglutinin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and phaseolin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The instability of seed proteins in non-seed tissues of transgenic plants was frequently attributed to protein targeting to protease-rich vacuoles in the vegetative cells, and subsequent degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The greatest accumulation of a seed storage protein from a nuclear-targeted gene was achieved using zeins, a maize seed storage protein that is targeted to "protein bodies" directly from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), thus avoiding the secretory route to the cellular vacuole. Transgenic expression from the CaMV 35S promoter in tobacco resulted in the formation of these protein bodies containing the zein within vegetative tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Alternatively, "short-circuiting" the protein-targeting route by addition of an ER retention signal to the storage-protein coding region also increased protein accumulation up to 100&#x000d7; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>In many legumes, accumulation of specific vegetative storage proteins (VSPs) in leaves and stems is the main source of increased nitrogen content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Use of VSPs instead of seed storage proteins to increase vegetative protein content in monocots may provide an advantage since they have evolved to function in vegetative cell types. Legume vegetative cells that accumulate VSP proteins contain multiple vacuole types and storage proteins are targeted to specific vacuoles where they are not rapidly degraded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and do not interfere with cellular metabolic processes. It is uncertain if monocots can produce similar vacuoles or successfully target a VSP to them. The most studied VSPs are the soybean VSP&#x003b1; and VSP&#x003b2; proteins, which are lysine-rich glycosylated vacuolar proteins that accumulate abundantly in leaves, stems and pods, but not in seeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Recently, soybean <italic>vspA </italic>and/or <italic>vspB </italic>genes fused to the 35S promoter were expressed in transgenic tobacco to study their accumulation in a heterologous dicot plant. Nuclear targeted genes produced VSP ranging between 2 and 6% of the soluble protein in leaves of the transgenic plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]; whereas, targeting to both the chloroplast and the vacuole within the same plant resulted in VSP comprising greater than 10% soluble protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Soybean VSP is therefore an excellent candidate for use in transgenic improvement of plant protein status, particularly grasses that contain limited levels of lysine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, it remains to be determined if VSPs can be expressed and accumulated in monocot plants since storage protein stability is dependent on post-translational events that may differ between monocots and eudicots. This manuscript presents the transgenic expression of soybean VSP&#x003b2; in the leaves of transgenic maize and discusses this expression in relation to the developmental stage of the plant.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Development of primary (R<sub>0</sub>) transgenic maize expressing <italic>vspB</italic></title><p>Out of 101 plants, twenty, belonging to five independent lines (71-1, 45-1, 45-3, 44-1, and 4-1) were shown by Southern blot analysis to contain a 1.5 kb hybridizing band corresponding to the intact <italic>bar </italic>gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). All 20 plants also contained the expected 1.9 kb band that hybridized to the <italic>vspB </italic>gene. The same probe detected two bands in <italic>Eco</italic>RI restricted Soybean genomic DNA, ~5.7 and 8.6 Kb, corresponding to the highly homologous genes <italic>vspA </italic>and <italic>vspB </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Western blot analysis was used to detect the VSP&#x003b2; polypeptide in leaf extracts from fourteen primary (R<sub>0</sub>) transgenic maize plants at vegetative stage (7 weeks old). A distinct VSP&#x003b2; band was not visible in silver-stained SDS-PAGE separated maize extract proteins due to complexity of the total protein pattern and the relatively low level of VSP&#x003b2; expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). However, some of these plants expressed VSP&#x003b2; at a level high enough to be detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). Two plants (71-1-53 and 45-3-1) had the highest level of VSP&#x003b2;, while four plants (71-1-23, 71-1-20, 45-1-4, and 45-1-7) accumulated a lower level of VSP&#x003b2;. Although a faint lower MW peptide band was visible in negative control maize extracts, VSP was clearly only present in transgenic lines. Faint detection of bands in untransformed maize (none of identical size to soybean VSP&#x003b2;) is consistent with previous reports of cross-hybridizing of soybean VSP antibodies with proteins from monocots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In soybean extracts used as a positive control, the antibody for VSP&#x003b2; recognized both VSP&#x003b1; and VSP&#x003b2; polypeptides (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b,c</xref>)</p><p>Computer analysis of digital images of the Western blots was used to detect differences in relative band intensity of the immunologically detected VSP&#x003b2; peptide. Because the native soybean VSPs (VSP&#x003b1; plus VSP&#x003b2;) were easily visible on total protein stained gels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>), relative quantification of total stained proteins in the soybean samples indicated that the VSPs represented about 10% of the total soluble protein in young soybean leaves. This is close to the previously reported value of 15 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The intensity of the transgenic maize 45-3-1 VSP&#x003b2; band on Western blots was 44% of the soybean VSP's band (digital image pixel quantification of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). Accounting for the differences in total protein applied to the gel (less soybean total protein was loaded), the VSP&#x003b2; protein was estimated to have accumulated to 0.5 % of the total soluble protein. This is similar to the highest level of seed storage protein accumulation observed with the ectopic expression of zein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], but remains less than the 1% minimal expression level predicted by Wandelt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] to be needed to directly alter the nutritional quality of the leaves. Although the 0.5% of total soluble protein was too low to alter nutritional value, detection of VSP&#x003b2; in 45-3-1 allowed monitoring of VSP&#x003b2; level in leaves and stems during plant development.</p></sec><sec><title>Presence of <italic>vspB </italic>in R<sub>1 </sub>plants</title><p>R<sub>1 </sub>plants were produced by back-crossing the R<sub>0 </sub>plants with Hi II control non-transformed pollen. Back-crossing was performed because R<sub>0 </sub>plants directly regenerated from tissue culture did not have synchronized production of pollen and receptive female flowers. The R<sub>1 </sub>families segregating for <italic>bar </italic>expression were analyzed for the presence of the <italic>vspB </italic>gene by Southern blot analysis. From 57 R<sub>1 </sub>plants analyzed, Southern blot analysis showed that 35 (61%) contained the <italic>vspB </italic>gene integrated into the genome. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> shows examples for several R<sub>1 </sub>from five R<sub>0 </sub>parental lines. The ~1.9 kb <italic>vspB </italic>band can be seen in nine of the 16 R<sub>1 </sub>lines. There are also fainter bands one slightly larger than the 1.9 kb band and one or two migrating between 4 and 5 kb. These are often observed as incomplete restriction of all <italic>Eco RI </italic>sites internal to plasmid DNA that is integrated into the maize genome. Similar bands are observed even with the plasmid control.</p><p>Total RNA was isolated from leaves of young R<sub>1 </sub>plants at the vegetative stage (7 weeks after planting). Eighteen transgenic R<sub>1 </sub>plants, including the ones originating from R<sub>0 </sub>plants representing different levels of VSP&#x003b2; accumulation (high VSP&#x003b2; accumulators: 45-3-1, 71-1-53; mid-level VSP&#x003b2; accumulators: and 71-1-23, 71-1-20, 45-1-4, 45-1-7 and low VSP&#x003b2; accumulators: 44-1-1- 4-1-2), were analyzed for <italic>vspB </italic>transcripts. Because of high sequence similarity (85%) between <italic>vspA </italic>and <italic>vspB </italic>cDNAs, the same probe hybridized in soybean with both mRNAs as demonstrated by Staswick [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The transgenic plants 71-1-53A, 71-1-20A, 71-1-20E, and 71-1-20I produced a hybridizing band of approximately the expected size of 1.1 kb indicating transgene expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>); however, most did not. Use of the <italic>Ubi</italic>-1 promoter for both the <italic>vspB </italic>and <italic>bar </italic>gene probably led to a high number of transgenics with the <italic>vspB </italic>silenced, and a higher level of VSP&#x003b2; accumulation will likely result in future work using a combination of different promoters.</p><p>Immunodetection of VSP&#x003b2; protein in transgenic young plant leaves showed variation in accumulation in comparisons between the parental (R<sub>0</sub>) and their R<sub>1 </sub>progeny, with the greatest variation observed with the highest VSP&#x003b2; expressing R<sub>0 </sub>plants (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). The parental line 71-1-53 had a relatively high level of expression of VSP&#x003b2;, but the only transgenic offspring from this line, 71-1-53A, had almost undetectable VSP&#x003b2;; in contrast, a low level accumulator, 71-1-20, produced R<sub>1 </sub>lines expressing different levels of VSP&#x003b2;, although none of them expressed at higher levels than the parent. Quantification of the relative level of VSP&#x003b2; expressed in the R<sub>1 </sub>leaves showed that the highest level measured was only 0.03% of total soluble protein.</p><p>Despite the overall low level of VSP&#x003b2; expression, for the purposes of this work, VSP&#x003b2; accumulation in several of the plants was high enough to study the relationship of plant developmental stage and <italic>vspB</italic>/VSP&#x003b2; accumulation. Both the transcript abundance and VSP&#x003b2; protein accumulation were determined in the R<sub>1 </sub>lines using real-time quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot immunodetection, respectively. Real-time RT-PCR is more sensitive that Northern blot analysis and was able to detect transcripts that were not seen with standard total RNA blotting methods. The <italic>vspB </italic>transcript was quantified in leaves from immature plants (prior to tassel formation) and silage stage plants (plants with developing seeds at the 18 DAP-days after pollination stage), as well as, stems from the silage stage plants, (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The <italic>vspB </italic>transcript was detected in all five transgenics (four of which had RNA not detectable using standard Northern blot methods). The relative level of RNA among the different plant samples was not consistent across the different lines with some having more transcripts in the young leaves while others had more in the older leaves and stems.</p><p>When <italic>vspB </italic>RNA abundance was compared to VSP&#x003b2; protein accumulation there was no correlation between the two (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a, b, c</xref>). Antiserum to VSP&#x003b2; detected VSP&#x003b2; only in leaves from young maize plants that had not yet flowered. No VSP&#x003b2; was detected in leaves and stems of silage stage corn that had developing seed. The soybean VSP&#x003b2; peptide was the primary band reacting with the antiVSP&#x003b2; antiserum in young leaves of transgenic maize, however, in silage stage stems and to a lesser extent the silage stage leaves, there were multiple bands detected at a different size than the VSP&#x003b2;. These were also detected in the non-transgenic control plant samples and therefore, were not due to different modifications of the soybean VSP&#x003b2;. Although the VSP&#x003b2; protein dropped below detectable levels in the silage stage 71-1-20A, 45-3-1F and 45-3-1-G plants, the <italic>vsp&#x003b2; </italic>transcript was still detectable. In fact, in the 71-1-20A plants the transcript level was highest in the silage stage leaves that had no detectable VSP&#x003b2;. Therefore, post-transcriptional events (i.e., changes in either the translational efficiency of the <italic>vspB </italic>transcript or the protein stability of VSP&#x003b2;) were altered in the silage stage leaves and stems as compared to the leaves of immature plants.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The <italic>vspB </italic>gene was successfully introduced into R<sub>0 </sub>regenerated maize and transferred to the R<sub>1 </sub>progeny, of which <italic>vspB </italic>transcript and VSP&#x003b2; protein were detected and studied. This is the first report on introduction and expression of a legume vegetative storage protein in a monocot plant. The inability to detect VSP&#x003b2; from the maize vegetative tissue at the time of seed development, even when the <italic>vspB </italic>transcript was still expressed, must have arisen from either reduced translational efficiency of the <italic>vspB </italic>transcript or a decrease in the stability of the VSP&#x003b2; protein. The reduction of seed storage protein level in leaves of transgenic eudicots was also observed with expression of vicillin in alfalfa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and tobacco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]; however, it was not observed with the expression of VSP&#x003b1; in tobacco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] or ovalbumin in alfalfa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. These data suggest that factors controlling developmental change in vegetative tissue protein accumulation are a combination of host plant traits and innate characteristics of the ectopically expressed protein. It is interesting to speculate that if, in maize (a monocot), soybean VSP&#x003b2; was degraded in a manner that provided amino acids that were translocated to the seed to support seed development, then development of high level VSP expressing monocots may be a way to improve nitrogen content of the seed/grain produced by the plant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant material and tissue culture methods</title><p>Plants of hybrid "Hi-II" maize were established in a greenhouse and immature tassels were used for embryogenic type II callus production, as described by Armstrong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Transgenic plant development</title><p>Microprojectile bombardment of callus was performed using the procedure of Somers et al.

Reverse transcription was performed for 30 min at 50&#x000b0;C followed by a 15 min denaturing at 95&#x000b0;C, and 40 cycles of 40 s at 95&#x000b0;C, 40 s at 58&#x000b0;C and 40 s at 72&#x000b0;C. Quantification was based on relative abundance to maize 18S RNA by amplifying a 174 bp fragment with primers: 5'-CCTGCGGCTTAATTGACTC-3' and 5'-GTTAGCAGGCTGAGGTCTCG-3', and using the comparative quantification function of the Rotor-Gene RG-3000 software. All real-time RT-PCR experiments were conducted in triplicate and on triplicate RNA preparations for each sample. Melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis were performed to verify single product formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Protein was extracted from 100 mg of leaves and stems with 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) supplemented with 1 tablet/10 ml buffer of the Complete-Mini protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) by homogenizing in the presence of zirconia/silica 0.1 mm dia. beads. Centrifuged extract supernatants were removed and used for protein concentration determination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Because of the low protein yields in stem extracts, they were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA), washed with ice-cold acetone and resuspended prior to SDS-PAGE analysis.</p><p>Thirty micrograms of protein were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins in the gel were either stained with silver nitrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] or transferred to Hybond-P (PVDF) membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc. Piscataway, NJ) using Trans-Blot SD Semi-Dry Transfer Cell blotter and recommended protocols (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Soybean VSP was immunologically detected on the PDF membranes with anti VSP&#x003b2; serum (provided by P. Staswick, University of Nebraska, produced as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] used at a 1:5,000 dilution. Detection was performed using a luminol substrate and the NEN Life Science Products, Inc. (Boston, MA) Reinascence kit. Chemiluminescent signal was captured by a Kodak Digital Science Image Station 440 Cf, and analyzed with Kodak 1D Scientific Image Software. Quantification of band intensity was always compared relative to samples from the same gel.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; VSP, vegetative storage protein</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MFG participated in experimental design, carried out the transgenic plant development, plant crosses, and molecular blotting/detection methods, and participated in manuscript draft preparation.

Two hundred micrograms of total RNA from the indicated tissue was used as the template source for real-time RT-PCR detection of <italic>vspB </italic>transcripts. Reactions were performed in 15 uL volume using the Qiagen Quantitect SYBR Green kit. Expression values are calculated by normalizing all threshold cycles (C<sub>t</sub>) for <italic>vspB </italic>to the 18S rRNA C<sub>t </sub>and converting this value to fold-increase over the value for the lowest expressing tissue, *44-1-1-stem, which was arbitrarily set at 1.0. b,c) Developmental changes in VSP&#x003b2; level in transgenic maize vegetative tissues. Soybean VSP&#x003b2; was immunodetected in Western blots of 30 &#x003bc;gs of total protein from crude extracts separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and blotted to Hybond-P membranes. Crude Extracts were prepared from: YL, leaves from preflowering plants; SL, leaves from silage stage plants; and SS, stems from silage stage plants.
