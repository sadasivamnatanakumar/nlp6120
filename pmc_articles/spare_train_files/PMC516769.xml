Genetic variation between inbred strains is considerable and has recently been characterized in detail using single nucleotide polymorphisms[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Differences in genetic background between strains affect the gene expression levels of a subset of genes, which probably explains phenotypic differences. Indeed, several reports have been published in which gene expression profiles have been used as QTLs in genetic mapping studies to identify complex traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>From literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], it appears that the subset of genes for which expression is significantly affected by genetic background is small. However, this has never been related to the extent of gene expression changes observed due to disease-causing mutations. We are studying differential gene expression between affected and healthy muscle in a range of murine models for neuromuscular disorders with different genetic backgrounds (Turk <italic>et al</italic>., manuscript in preparation). We, therefore, determined gene expression levels in hindlimb muscles from five frequently used wildtype mouse inbred strains, and compared these to the differential gene expression levels in affected muscle tissue from a mouse model (<italic>mdx</italic>) for Duchenne muscular dystrophy with healthy muscle tissue. Both the number of differentially expressed genes between strains as well as the fold-change levels are lower when compared to the differences found in affected versus healthy muscle tissue.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Gene expression levels in hindlimb muscle tissue from five different inbred strains (CBA, BALB, BL6, DBA, and BL10) were determined. Total RNA from two individuals per strain was isolated, reversed transcribed, and subsequently labelled according to a recently developed protocol (adapted from Xiang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002), which requires an input of only 1 &#x003bc;g total RNA. Labelled cDNA was hybridised to murine microarrays containing 7,776 65-mer oligonucleotides spotted in duplicate.</p><p>Significance levels (p-values) between the five mouse inbred strains were calculated using analysis of variance[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Significance levels among two individual mice within each strain were determined using a hierarchical <italic>t</italic>-test providing higher statistical power than conservative methods for low (2&#x02013;4) replicate numbers[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The higher power is yielded by borrowing information across genes to produce a better expression variance estimator. The gain in power is reported via an increase in the degrees of freedom associated with the t-test. Differentially expressed genes for both computations were selected by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), as suggested by Benjamini and Hochberg (1995), rather than using pre-defined cut-offs for p-values or corrections for multiple testing. The FDR represents an expectation of the proportion of false positives among the selected differentially expressed genes, which increases dramatically during multiple testing, inherent in microarray experiments[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Using an FDR of 10% we selected 88 out of 6144 (1.4%) expressed genes that are differentially expressed between strains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). A lower number of differentially expressed genes was found in the analysis of variation within strains with identical FDRs of 10% (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Results with other FDR levels are available online as additional file. Correlation between gene expression levels of the two samples from each strain was high (Pearson correlation coefficient ranging from 0.87 to 0.95), also indicating low internal variation (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). A considerable amount of differentially expressed genes (718 genes) were selected when pre-defined cut-off values (p &#x0003c; 0.05) were used to determine the differential gene expression between strains. However, adjusted FDR levels indicated a proportion of false positives equal to 42%. On the other hand, adjusting for multiple testing using Bonferroni correction proved to be too stringent, leaving no or few differentially expressed genes. Controlling the FDR, therefore, appears to be an optimal method for both selecting differential gene expression and simultaneously determining the validity of the experimental outcome.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Differentially expressed genes between mouse inbred strains Relative expression levels of differentially expressed genes between mouse inbred strains are depicted in colour as relative intensity levels.

Selection with an FDR of 10% resulted in 1298 differentially expressed genes. Differential gene expression between the two most divergent mouse inbred strains (BL6 and CBA, data not shown) was determined to allow a direct comparison with identical statistical methods. Selection with an FDR of 10% showed an approximately ten-fold decrease in the number of differentially expressed genes (126). Absolute fold changes were calculated and subsequently a comparison of the distribution was made (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Median gene expression levels are equal between affected/control and inbred/inbred. However, the number of large fold changes (&#x0003e;3) between affected/healthy (221) is much higher than between inbred/inbred (7), consistent with low contribution of differential expression due to genetic background.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Effect of different genetic background on differential gene expression The distribution of absolute fold changes of differentially expressed genes (n = 1298) between affected (<italic>mdx</italic>) and healthy (WT) muscle were compared to the distribution of absolute fold changes of differentially expressed genes (n = 126) between two mouse inbred strains (CBA and BL6).

This is particularly evident when the number of differentially expressed genes between two mouse inbred strains (C57 vs. Bl6, 126 genes with 7 genes having a fold-change &#x0003e; 3) is compared to that between diseased and healthy muscle tissue (<italic>mdx </italic>vs. wild-type, 1298 genes with 221 genes having a fold-change &#x0003e;3). Therefore, the use of mice with deviating genetic background may be justified in disease-related studies. Alternatively, strain-dependent gene expression differences may be evaluated in the initial study phase of gene targeting experiments, although the effect of hybrid backgrounds is difficult to assess.</p><p>Gene expression studies in the brain revealed that approximately 1% of expressed genes differ between two mouse strains[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Application of alternative statistical methods, similar to those used in our study, on this dataset resulted in an increase in the number of differentially expressed genes (approx. 3%) between the two mouse strains[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], demonstrating that the number of differentially expressed genes is highly dependent on the statistical criteria used. A similar number of differentially expressed genes was found in a comparison of hippocampal gene expression between 8 different mouse strains[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The results of our study in muscle tissue demonstrated that approximately 1.4% of the expressed genes show differential expression between mouse strains. Based on these results, strain differences in gene expression seem to have a similar magnitude across different tissues.</p><p>Genomic variability could be correlated with high levels of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) occurring in specific blocks between mouse inbred strains. The presence of cis-acting (single nucleotide) polymorphisms may be associated with regulatory variation affecting gene expression levels. It was estimated that probably a consistent amount (up to 6%) of the roughly estimated 35,000 mouse genes contain such functional regulatory variants[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We investigated if differentially expressed genes were localized in blocks with high genomic variability, but our number of differentially expressed genes was too low to obtain statistically significant answers (data not shown).</p><p>This study suggests an additional method for phenotyping mouse inbred strains and provides a list of genes with significant differential expression based upon false discovery rate selection. Although overall gene expression profiles are highly similar, most significant differences are determined by low gene expression levels of BL6 compared to the other strains. A large proportion of these BL6-specific genes function as structural muscle proteins (i.e. nebulin, alpha-actinin 2, myomesin 1 and radixin). To date, however, no major differences in muscle physiology in BL6-mice have been described which can be attributed to these reduced gene expression levels.</p><p>Perfectly isogenic backgrounds are sometimes difficult to obtain. This explorative study demonstrates that the effect of genetic background on muscle expression profiles is significant but rather limited compared to other effects, e.g. the dystrophic genetic defect (<italic>mdx</italic>) we study. As such, the genetic background will only marginally interfere with data analysis. Determination of gene expression profiles between mouse strains enables flagging a modest number of differentially expressed genes, and is an efficient and sensible approach to circumvent tedious backcrossings, necessary to obtain isogenic animals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Mouse breeding, tissue preparation and total RNA isolation</title><p>We obtained CBA/CaOlaHsd (CBA), BALB/cOlaHsd (BALB), C57Bl/6JOlaHsd (BL6), DBA/2OlaHsd (DBA), and C57Bl/10ScSnOlaHsd (BL10) mice from Harland Laboratories, and C57Bl/10ScSn-Dmd<sup>mdx/J </sup>(<italic>mdx</italic>) mice from Jackson Laboratory at the age of 6 weeks.

PCR mixture was prepared by combining cDNA dilution, 10 pmol forward and reverse primer, MgCl<sub>2 </sub>(4 mM) with 4x home-made LC mastermix (0.9 mM dNTPs, BSA (1 &#x003bc;l/&#x003bc;l, Pharmacia Biotech), Taq polymerase (0.8 U/&#x003bc;l), 4x SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes), 4x AmpliTaq Reaction Buffer (Perkin Elmer)) to a total volume of 20 &#x003bc;l. Amplicons were generated during 45 cycles with annealing temperature set at 55&#x000b0;C. Optimal cDNA dilutions and relative concentrations were determined using a dilution series per gene. Replicate experiments (n = 4) were normalized to 1 and relative expression values were determined by calculating the ratio per gene over the average relative expression of genes, which show no differential expression on both microarray and qPCR (dysferlin, cystatin B, and thrombospondin 4). Significance levels were calculated with a one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test. PCR primer pairs were designed using the Primer3 search engine, available at: <bold>Primer3 Software Distribution </bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/primer3_code.html"/>. The screened genes and the oligonucleotide primer pairs used for each of the genes in this study correspond to the following nucleotides: myomesin1, 4761&#x02013;4780 and 4865&#x02013;4884 (NM_010867); tropomodulin1, 670&#x02013;689 and 878&#x02013;897 (NM_021883); dysferlin, 4218&#x02013;4237 and 4353&#x02013;4372 (AF188290); cystatinB, 3&#x02013;22 and 151&#x02013;170 (NM_007793); thrombospondin4, 2167&#x02013;2186 and 2289&#x02013;2308 (NM_011582).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>RT carried out the tissue preparation, total RNA isolation, target preparation, hybridisations, experimental design, data extraction, data analysis, rt-PCR, and the drafting of the manuscript.
