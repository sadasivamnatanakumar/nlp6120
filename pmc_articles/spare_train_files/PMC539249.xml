Various studies suggest that both the cellular and humoral components of the immune system are able to recognize tumors (see review of Lake et al.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The presence of natural antibodies against cancer cells in peripheral blood of tumor patients probably plays a protective role against tumor development. The latest advances in molecular techniques further support the existence of natural antibodies against cancer antigens. The SEREX approach, based on the serological screening of cDNA expression libraries generated from tumor tissues of various origin, led to the molecular definition of immunogenic tumor proteins (tumor-associated antigens, TAAs) based on their reactivity with autologous patient sera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This type of screening of a cDNA expression library is quite a laborious procedure requiring the preparation of a large number of membrane filters blotted with bacteriophage plaques, which are then screened with sera from cancer patients, usually available in limited quantity. In contrast to SEREX, phage display strategy is based on the selection and enrichment of antigens displayed on the phage surface. A physical link between a displayed fusion protein and the DNA encoding for it makes this phage target selectable through affinity purification. Phage display technology has been successfully applied to the screening of cDNA libraries from different tumors using the antibody repertoire of cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In these experiments different phage display systems were used. Some of the authors used the C-terminus of a filamentous phage minor protein pVI for expression of cDNA libraries from breast cancer cell lines T47D and MCF-7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and from colorectal cancer cell line HT-29 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, the filamentous phage display system imposes some biological bias for the expression and display of fusion proteins, since a filamentous phage-based library displays only those recombinant proteins able to pass through the inner bacterial membrane during filamentous phage assembly. To overcome this potential problem the lytic bacteriophages T7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and &#x003bb; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] were used. By using these latter systems, the phage capsid is assembled in the cytoplasm of bacteria and mature phage particles are released by cell lysis. For example, Hansen and co-workers in their studies screened a commercially available (Novagen) human breast cancer cDNA library cloned in T7 vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], identifying positive clones.</p><p>Usually cDNA libraries are generated as C-terminal fusions. When such a library is panned on a serum, the presence of a complex antibody repertoire gives to out-of-frame or antisense-derived cross-reactive short peptide sequences a good chance of being enriched. In our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] we designed a new-concept lambda vector for the display of cDNA-encoded protein fragments as fusion to the N-terminus of bacteriophage gpD, allowing us to overcome this obstacle. In this vector, phage clones display a given protein fragment on the phage surface only when the insert's correct reading frame matches that of gpD. The size of the cloned DNA fragments in our libraries was adjusted to an average of 200&#x02013;300 base pairs, which is of a size reasonably sufficient to potentially encode for a protein domain. The vast majority of out-of-frame sequences of the above-mentioned length most probably contains at least one in-frame stop codon. Thus, these inserts are not expressed as D fusion, are consequently not displayed on the phage surface and cannot be selected. In such cases, phage capsid contains only wt gpD encoded by lambda genome <italic>D </italic>gene. The N-terminal display system greatly reduces the selection of artifactual peptides, in comparison with a C-terminal fusion library displayed on lambda ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and our unpublished data).</p><p>By employing the SEREX approach numerous tumor antigens from different human neoplasms were identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Analysis of TAA expression in tumor samples and normal tissue led to the identification of a group, called cancer/testis antigens. Members belonging to this family are aberrantly expressed in human cancers and only in normal testis, but not in other normal tissue. For this reason, in addition to tumor samples and tumor cell lines, testicular cDNA libraries are also a convenient source of antigens which can be identified by screening with sera derived from tumor patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>In the present work we report the construction of lambda-displayed cDNA libraries from breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, MDA-MB-468, from human breast carcinomas and from human testis, generated according to an improved protocol. These libraries were screened by using sera from breast cancer patients. The list of 21 identified antigens contains eight proteins with still unknown functions. Three of the genes (T7-1, T11-3 and T11-9) were found to be overexpressed in tumors as compared to normal breast. Recognition by human sera of five of the selected antigens (T6-2, T6-7, T7-1, T9-21 and T9-27) was associated with cancer diagnosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tissue and serum samples</title><p>Specimens of breast carcinoma and autologous sera from breast cancer patients (B81-B96) were obtained from M.

The nucleotide sequences of 21 clones that exhibited specific or preferential reactivity with sera from breast tumor patients as compared to sera from healthy donors were identified, and their nucleotide sequences were determined (Table 2 [see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>]).</p></sec><sec><title>Serological analysis of tumor antigens</title><p>Phage lysates were prepared from all the selected clones as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and tested in ELISA first with a collection of negative, and subsequently, with positive sera (Table 2 [see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>]).

Most of the clones correspond to known gene products in the correct orientation and reading frame, with the exception of clone T5-18 encoding myc oncogen in an alternative frame. Several of these known gene products, such as reverse transcriptase homolog (clones T5-9, T9-21, T9-27, T11-7), protein kinase C-binding protein (T6-1), trap ankyrin repeat (T11-3), heat shock protein apg-2 (T11-13), have been previously identified by SEREX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].

It has been previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], by comparing the expression level of target genes in SMART PCR-amplified cDNAs and their corresponding total RNAs, that SMART cDNA accurately reflects gene expression patterns found in total RNA. We normalized the panel of cDNAs from ten different breast carcinomas, one metastasized lymph node, normal breast, normal testis and peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy donors, by PCR amplification of a housekeeping gene, &#x003b2;-actin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Three of the identified antigens, fucosyltransferase (T6-7), Zinc finger protein 258 (T11-6), and p53-binding protein (T1-52) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], were ubiquitously expressed in all the tumor and normal tissue samples tested (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Some of the antigens, T5-15 (KIAA1735), T5-13 (Sos1), T11-5 (hypothetical protein MGC4170) were found to be downregulated in many tumors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). T11-9 (hypothetical protein AF225417) was overexpressed in 50% of the primary tumors and the unique metastasized lymph node tested. T11-3 (trap ankyrin repeat) was overexpressed in most of the tumors tested in comparison with normal breast, although it was also transcribed in testis and normal lymphocytes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). T7-1 (KIAA1288) was found to be overexpressed in 50% of the primary breast carcinomas and in the metastasis specimen tested. In order to obtain an evaluation of the accuracy of the method used for the analysis of gene expression, we performed PCR amplification of neu/HER2, a known tumor marker overexpressed in breast cancer. We observed that neu/HER2 is overexpressed in 2 primary tumors among the 7 tested (&#x02248;29%) in accordance with the literature on breast carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study we report the construction of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines, breast carcinoma and testis cDNA phage-displayed libraries expressed as fusions to bacteriophage lambda gpD. The new phage vectors bear a flexible GS linker between the cloned protein domain and protein D, so as to facilitate lambda head assembly. Moreover, a new efficient protocol to synthesize cDNA was applied. We primed cDNA synthesis on mRNA template with random oligonucleotides containing a constant 5' end. After complete synthesis of double-stranded cDNA, a second round of random priming was applied to generate oriented fragments of cDNA suitable for library construction. This protocol, in comparison with previous version, increases the presence of authentic protein domains in the library twofold, because of correct cDNA orientation. Moreover, some of the clones isolated from our previous libraries were results of chimerical fusion of two or more different genes, generated through double random priming on ds cDNA template. The new protocol has reduced this problem significantly.</p><p>We also confirmed the advantage of N-terminal fusion for domain library construction in phage display vectors for screening with sera, because a significant amount of false positive cross-reactive clones, containing stop codons downstream of the fusion site giving rise to short mimotope sequences, were selected from the C-terminal fusion library (T6). Only 4 clones with specific tumor-related reactivity were isolated from the T6 library. However, C-terminal fusion might allow efficient display and selection for some antigenic C-terminal protein domains. In fact, the C-terminal fragment of fucosyltransferase (clone T6-7) was isolated from the T6 library.</p><p>The panel of selected TAAs in Table 2 [see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>] contains several functionally defined gene products, previously unknown as tumor antigens. AKAP450 and Sos1 proteins, corresponding to clones T5-8 and T5-13, are intracellular components of the signal transduction pathway. Sos1 is a well-known guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras oncogene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Transgenic mice expressing a dominant form of Sos in basal keratinocytes develop skin papillomas with 100% penetrance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Moreover, a Sos1 mutant, lacking four functionally important proline-rich (SH3 binding) regions was reported to be responsible for gingival fibromatosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. AKAP450 is a member of the A-kinase anchor proteins family. It is located in the centrosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and acts as a microtubule nucleation site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and as a scaffold for proteins involved in mitotic process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Other selected antigens with known or predicted intracellular location are alpha-6-fucosyltransferase (clone T6-7) and zinc finger protein 258 (ZNF258, clone T11-6). Alpha-fucosyltransferase catalyzes the transfer of GDP-fucose to oligosaccharide chains linked to proteins, lipids and sugars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and resides in the luminal compartment of trans-Golgi vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The predicted protein product ZNF258 contains zinc-binding motif repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. If ZNF258, together with structural homology, also shares biological properties with zinc finger proteins, thus recognizing and interacting with DNA, it should have a nuclear localization. The presence on our antigen list of proteins with predicted intracellular residence is in agreement with findings from the other groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and is related to possible tissue necrosis and cell lysis associated with tumor growth.</p><p>The human myc oncogene is transcribed from four alternative promoters giving rise to mRNAs for Myc1, Myc2, MYCHEX1 and 5'ORF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Clone T5-18 is the result of the translation of an alternative frame to Myc1, Myc2 and does not correspond to any known protein product of myc oncogene transcription. It is not clear whether selection of this clone is an artifact of the experiment, or the result of an aberrant genome rearrangement in the tumor cells used for library construction.</p><p>Among isolated antigens, there are 4 clones (T5-9, T9-21, T9-27 and T11-7) having between 55&#x02013;91% sequence identity with that of a reverse transcriptase homolog (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Viral antigens corresponding to human endogenous retrovirus were previously isolated from renal cancers and melanomas by SEREX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. It is interesting to note that all these clones, isolated with sera from breast cancer patients, derive from libraries constructed with cDNA from every different origin utilized: i.e. cell lines (T5), solid tumor (T9), testis (T11). We have no explanation for the transcription of reverse transcriptase gene in normal testis tissue.</p><p>Eight proteins in the tumor antigen panel are unknown, or hypothetical proteins with unknown functions (T5-2, <underline>T5-15</underline>, T5-19, T6-2, T6-6, <underline>T7-1</underline>, <underline>T11-5</underline>, <underline>T11-9</underline>). The four underlined gene products from the list in parenthesis were analyzed for mRNA expression in tumors and normal breast tissue. The mRNA expression levels were analyzed by PCR from SMART-cDNA template in 7&#x02013;10 breast cancer specimens, one metastasized lymph node, normal breast, testis and peripheral lymphocytes from healthy donors. Two of these 4 unknown antigens and T11-3 were found to be frequently overexpressed in breast cancer. In particular clone T7-1, which was classified as encoding for an unknown protein since it has 100% identity only with KIAA1288 from EST database, was found to be overexpressed in breast carcinomas. This finding, together with the good reactivity of T7-1 protein with sera from tumor patients, identifies this antigen among the most promising targets for diagnosis of the disease.</p><p>In contrast to the other antigens, which are overexpressed in breast cancer, mRNAs of T5-13, T5-15 and T11-5 appear to be underexpressed in 50&#x02013;90% of breast cancer specimens, in comparison with normal breast tissue. How the immune system succeeds in responding to such antigens is still not clear. However, this finding is common to several SEREX-defined antigens, such as LU-12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], REN-9, REN-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and BR-41 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], representing a group of TAAs deleted or downregulated in tumors. Lu-12, REN-9, Ren-10 map within cancer tumor suppressor gene locus at chromosome 3p21.3, a region often deleted in small cell lung cancer as well as in renal cancer. Downregulated antigen BR-41 was identified as SNT-1, a membrane-associated adaptor protein interacting with Sos1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In the present work we show that Sos1 (T5-13) is also downregulated in 50% of breast cancer samples. The downregulated antigens T11-5, T5-13 (Sos1), and T5-15 do not react with sera from patients B82-B96 analyzed for tumor mRNA expression. Furthermore, tumor biopsies from patients with good response for these antigens were not available for expression analysis. Thus, at present, it is not possible to determine whether T11-5, T5-13 (Sos1), and T5-15 are normally expressed, or downregulated, in patients showing an immune response for the corresponding antigen.</p><p>Sequence comparison of T11-5 and T5-15 clones with the EST database revealed identity with the hypothetical proteins MGC4170 and KIAA1735. We have derived the aa sequence of the corresponding ORFs and predicted the whole sequence architecture by computer analysis using the SMART program <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de"/>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]). MGC4170 encodes for two NL domains, while KIAA1335 encodes for a 389 aa protein bearing a DIX domain at the carboxy-terminus. The presence of such structural domains indicates that both of these still unknown proteins (corresponding to clones T11-5 and T5-15), which we found downregulated in several tumor specimens, may be involved in the signal transduction machinery.</p><p>In spite of the fact that several promising antigens were identified from cDNA library constructed from testis mRNA, none of the antigens derived from testis or other libraries could be classified as specific testis/cancer (CT) antigen, because of their low expression in testis (T11-9, T7-1) or expression in other tissues as well.</p><p>In this work we analyzed the frequency of the immune response to the 21 identified antigens by using a panel of sera from tumor patients and healthy donors. In general, we observed a low frequency of serum reactivity with the antigens, which was expected and is similar to that of the vast majority of SEREX-identified clones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. A significant number of sera from tumor patients, in comparison with healthy individuals, efficiently recognized five of the identified antigens (T6-2, T6-7, T7-1, T9-21, T9-27). Clones T9-21 and T9-27, isolated from breast carcinoma library, respectively show 70% homology (55% identity) and 62% homology (68% identity) to reverse transcriptase homolog (PO8547). T7-1 is a protein having an unknown function, which was found to be overexpressed in breast carcinoma.</p><p>Taken together, these results lead us to believe that analysis of a complex panel of serologically-defined TAAs, with very large panels of sera from patients classified according to clinical parameters, i.e., age of patient, stage, extent and outcome of disease, etc. could lead to a much clearer understanding of the role, specificity and significance of the immune response versus disease in cancer patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We demonstrated that a lambda display-based approach permits the efficient identification of tumor antigens, potential immunological targets in breast cancer. The list of 21 antigens identified in this work contains eight proteins of still unknown function. Three of the genes (T7-1, T11-3, T11-9) were found to be overexpressed in tumors as compared to normal breast. Five of the selected antigens (T6-2, T6-7, T7-1, T9-21, T9-27) were recognized specifically by breast cancer patient sera.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>aa, amino acids; Ag, antigen; EST, expressed sequence tags; ds cDNA, double-stranded cDNA; SEREX, serological identification of antigens by recombinant expression cloning; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PEG, polyethylene glycol; pfu, plaque-forming units; Sos1, son of sevenless homolog 1; TAA, tumor-associated antigen.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>EP, PV, AP, GM, EB, FF and OM are salaried by an organization holding two patents relating to the content of the manuscript.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>EP and PV contributed equally to the work.
