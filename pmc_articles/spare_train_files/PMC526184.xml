Soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic>) is one of the most economically valuable crop species in the world food supply. In order to accelerate both gene discovery as well as hypothesis-driven research in soybean, global expression resources needed to be developed. The applications of microarray for determining patterns of expression in different tissues or during conditional treatments by dual labeling of the mRNAs are unlimited. In addition, discovery of the molecular basis of traits through examination of naturally occurring variation in hundreds of mutant lines could be enhanced by the construction and use of soybean cDNA microarrays.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We report the construction and analysis of a low redundancy 'unigene' set of 27,513 clones that represent a variety of soybean cDNA libraries made from a wide array of source tissue and organ systems, developmental stages, and stress or pathogen-challenged plants.</p><p>The set was assembled from the 5' sequence data of the cDNA clones using cluster analysis programs. The selected clones were then physically reracked and sequenced at the 3' end. In order to increase gene discovery from immature cotyledon libraries that contain abundant mRNAs representing storage protein gene families, we utilized a high density filter normalization approach to preferentially select more weakly expressed cDNAs. All 27,513 cDNA inserts were amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The amplified products, along with some repetitively spotted control or 'choice' clones, were used to produce three 9,728-element microarrays that have been used to examine tissue specific gene expression and global expression in mutant isolines.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Global expression studies will be greatly aided by the availability of the sequence-validated and low redundancy cDNA sets described in this report. These cDNAs and ESTs represent a wide array of developmental stages and physiological conditions of the soybean plant. We also demonstrate that the quality of the data from the soybean cDNA microarrays is sufficiently reliable to examine isogenic lines that differ with respect to a mutant phenotype and thereby to define a small list of candidate genes potentially encoding or modulated by the mutant phenotype.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Genes of higher plants are expressed in a coordinated fashion during development of tissue and organ systems and in response to different environmental conditions. This regulation may be tightly linked for some sets of genes, for example, in a specific biochemical pathway. Expression of regulatory genes may modulate the expression of key genes or entire sets of genes in individual pathways. The investigation of single gene expression patterns as determined by RNA blotting or quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR have been used to understand how different temporal, developmental, and physiological processes affect gene expression. With recent advances in genomics, very large numbers of genes can now be simultaneously analyzed for their expression levels in a comparative fashion between two biological states using microarray or biochip technology. Several techniques for the 'global' analysis of gene expression have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. These include (a) high density expression arrays of cDNAs on conventional nylon filters with radioactive probing; (b) microarrays or 'chips' using fluorescent probes, and (c) serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE).</p><p>Methods for global expression analysis require either knowledge of the entire genome of an organism or accumulation of a large EST (expressed sequence tag) database for the organism. In soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic>), more than 286,000 5' EST sequences have been generated and deposited in public databases [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and this report]. These 5'ESTs represent a collection of 80 cDNA libraries from different tissue and organ systems at various stages of development and under diverse physiological conditions. Collaborative, multidisciplinary research to enhance the development of plant genome resources and information that would be publicly available for gene expression, gene tagging, and mapping has been a priority in recent years in plants of agronomic importance, including soybean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Here, we report the development, qualification, and use of 27,513 members of a low redundancy set of tentatively unique cDNAs or 'unigenes' in soybean. The 3' sequence of this set was determined and microarrays constructed. The public availability of the low redundancy clone set, sequence information, and microarrays reported here will greatly enhance gene discovery and genomic scale research in soybean and other legumes by the community of researchers. For example, we illustrate the use of the 5' and 3' sequence-verified cDNA microarrays to determine organ-specific expression and we demonstrate their potential to discover the molecular basis of specific mutations in closely related isogenic lines.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Cluster analysis of 280,000 ESTs reveals 61,127 'unigenes' in soybean</title><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> illustrates an overview of the data generation and analysis used to create a low redundancy 'unigene' set and its use in construction of cDNA microarrays. The 5' EST sequence information was used as the raw material including the addition of over 30 new cDNA libraries and more than 160,000 5' sequences since an initial report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In total now, over 80 libraries and over 280,000 5' EST have been generated from many tissue and organ systems of various stages of development, ranging from roots, shoots, leaves, stems, pods, cotyledons, germinating shoot tips, flower meristems, tissue culture derived embryos, and pathogen challenged tissues. These libraries, with the one exception of library Gm-r1030 described below, were non-normalized. Thus, the mRNAs that are more abundant in various tissue and organ systems will be more highly represented in the EST collection. To remove redundancy and identify unique sequences, the ESTs were assembled using the Phrap program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] into contiguous regions (contigs) representing overlapping sequences based on EST sequence similarity. In this way, longer overlapping sequences of expressed genes are assembled. Identical sequences that represent redundant mRNAs of various sizes are also recognized and the number of sequences in a contig in a non-normalized cDNA library is a rough approximation of the relative abundance of that particular mRNA within that tissue.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Steps in the construction and documentation of cDNA microarrays using a low redundancy soybean 'unigene' set of 27,513 cDNA clones.

As the number of ESTs grows, the number of unique genes in the organism will continue to be refined. Our current contig analysis of the entire public EST collection for soybean of 286,868 sequences yields 61,127 'unigenes' of which 36,357 are contigs and 24,770 are singletons.</p><p>The finding of 61,127 soybean unigenes by EST cluster analysis agrees well with an independent contig and unigene assembly in the databases of The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) which shows 30,084 contigs and 37,601 singletons for a total of 67,826 tentatively unique sequences from among 334,730 sequences representing all publicly available sequences clustered in Release 11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Other large scale plant EST collections as analyzed by the TIGR gene indices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] show 42,301 unigenes for <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>(of 247,429 ESTs), 36,976 for <italic>Medicago truncatula </italic>(of 189,919 ESTs), 31,012 for tomato (of 156,645 ESTs), 109,509 for wheat (of 494,195 ESTs) and 56,364 for maize (of 377,188 ESTs). The complete genome sequence for Arabidopsis has revealed an estimated 26,000 genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Of course, the unigene sets determined by EST clustering are only estimates of the number of unique genes in an organism and depend on the number of ESTs available, the technologies used to make the libraries, and the bioinformatic methods used to assign clusters. The soybean genome is approximately 1.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9 </sup>bp which is about 7.5 times the size of the Arabidopsis genome and twice that of tomato, but less than half the size of the maize genome. Thus, it is not unexpected that soybean may have a larger number of unigene clusters than Arabidopsis or tomato, for example. Although soybean is not hexaploid in origin as is modern wheat, it is thought to be an ancient autotetraploid and many examples of duplicate loci exist in soybean.</p></sec><sec><title>Virtual subtraction using high density cDNA filter arrays increases gene discovery in immature cotyledon libraries that abundantly express storage protein gene transcripts</title><p>Certain tissues contain large amounts of specialized transcripts. Developing soybean cotyledons, for example, contain large amounts of RNA transcripts representing highly expressed storage protein genes. In order to select for some of the weakly expressed cDNA clones from a mid-maturation stage cotyledon library, we used a virtual subtraction approach using high densisty filters. A total of 18,000 bacterial clones containing cDNAs from library Gm-c1007 (immature cotyledons of 100&#x02013;300 mg fresh weigh range from Williams variety) was printed in high density on nylon filters and probed with <sup>33</sup>P-cDNA produced by reverse transcription of total mRNA isolated from immature soybean cotyledons. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> shows the highly complex hybridization pattern resulting from using total mRNA from immature cotyledons to probe the high density filter. The intensity of each dot represents the hybridization signal and the relative abundance of that cDNA in the message population. The phosphorimager pattern was quantified by image analysis software and 5000 of the lowest expressing clones were selected. The cDNA clones were physically reracked to a new set of 384 well plates to form the filter-normalized reracked library designated Gm-r1030. The 5' end of these clones were then sequenced at Washington University. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> shows that 1,528, or 85%, of the 1799 sequences within the filter-driven reracked library Gm-r1030 were novel and not found in any of the 931 sequenced clones from the Gm-c1007 source cDNA library. Thus, the filter normalization method was an effective way to identify cDNAs with low expression and increase gene discovery in libraries that contain large numbers of transcripts from highly expressed genes. The virtual subtraction method using high density cDNA filters compares favorably with other mRNA subtraction methods used to create normalized libraries during the cloning process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Gene discovery is increased by selection of weakly expressed cDNAs clones from a cDNA library made from immature cotyledons.

An alternative method to the high density filters is microarray technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] in which PCR-amplified cDNA inserts, or oligonucleotides, are printed on glass slides and probed with mRNAs populations that have been separately labeled with different fluorescent probes.</p><p>To enable global expression studies, the ideal would be to have each gene represented at least once on an array. Toward this aim, we selected 27,513 of the cDNA clones by four successive clustering assemblies of the soybean cDNAs performed as the 5' EST data accumulated. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> shows the four reracked sets of cDNA clones (Gm-r1021, Gm-r1070, Gm-r1083, and Gm-r1088) and the level of uniqueness within them as defined by Phrap and CAP3 analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Thus, the clustering was conducted periodically as the number of 5' EST input sequences grew in size. After each clustering, the previously selected and reracked cDNAs were excluded from subsequent reracking lists. In order to develop a 'unigene' set for soybean, a single representative of each contig was chosen. To select a representative from each contig, we chose the cDNA clone corresponding to the EST that was found at the furthest 5' region of each contig. Thus, we are selecting the cDNA clones most likely to be near full-length.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of the percent unique sequences as determined by either CAP3 or Phrap analysis for the 5' and 3' ESTs represented in each of the four successive reracked clone subsets that constitute the low redundancy soybean 'unigene' set</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center">Rerack order &#x00026; name</td><td align="center">Number cDNAs</td><td align="center">No. ESTs clustered<sup>a</sup></td><td align="center">Cap3<sup>b</sup></td><td align="center">Phrap<sup>b</sup></td><td align="center">% Unique ESTs<sup>c </sup>Cap3 or Phrap</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">1.

However, the clustering analysis can also falsely lump non-identical members of gene families into the same contig based on conservation of sequence similarity in the coding region. The 3' sequencing is especially useful for resolving both of these issues as there is generally more variation in the 3' UTR in plant genes than in the coding region. For those reasons and as a quality control of the reracking process, we sequenced the 3' end of the reracked cDNAs. From the 27,513 total 3' sequencing attempts on the tentatively unique cDNAs represented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, a total of 22,088 sequences met the criteria of high quality sequence. The 3' sequencing was more problematic than the 5' sequencing due to termination of the sequencing reactions at some of the long polyA tails characteristic of soybean and many other plant cDNAs. An anchored primer was used to increase the success rate (see Methods). The average length of the 3' ESTs was 526 bases compared to the average 5' sequence read length of 474 for 280,094 ESTs.</p><p>Since the clustering analyses were performed at successive intervals as the EST collection grew in size, we repeated the Phrap contig analyses separately using only the input sequences of each cDNA rerack for which both a 5' and 3' EST were known. We also performed a CAP3 analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> shows that CAP3 values for the 5' sequence yielded 88.0 to 93.5% unique sequences while the Phrap values were slightly lower at 78.0 to 89.5% unique sequences. Interestingly, the estimate of unique sequences using the 5' EST data did not change substantially from reracked library r1021 where only approximately 6800 ESTs were clustered through library r1088 where over 250,000 sequences were clustered. A separate cluster analysis of only the 27,513 input 5' sequences revealed 81.2 to 88.2% unique sequences by Phrap and CAP3 analyses, respectively.</p><p>The 3' ESTs were also separately subjected to CAP3 or Phrap analysis. The CAP3 values showed a slightly higher level of uniqueness (or lower level of redundancy) with 79.3 to 91.5% for CAP3 in the successive clustering analyses versus 75.5 to 78.2% unique sequences as determined by Phrap. An overall figure of 73.0% for the CAP3 analysis on the 21,048 total 3' sequences clustered was found versus 63.3% for Phrap.</p><p>The differences between the 5' and 3' levels of uniqueness (i.e., 88.2% versus 73.0% for the entire sets as determined by CAP3) can be explained by the nature of reverse transcriptase action. The reverse transcriptase was primed using an oligo dT primer and so the cDNAs will begin at the 3' end and will terminate randomly at variable sites as the enzyme progresses to the 5' end of the mRNA template. Thus, 5' ESTs often begin at variable sites. Therefore, even though two 5' ESTs may have originated from the same mRNA transcript, they will not cluster if they are non-overlapping and will be counted as two separate ESTs. The 3' soybean EST reads begin just after the poly A tail and produce longer average read lengths than the 5' soybean ESTs; thus, the 3' ESTs are more likely to form an overlapping contig if there is any redundancy among them.</p><p>The 5' and 3' sequence (where known) of each soybean unigene were queried against the non-redundant (nr) database with BLASTX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].

We have processed all of these cDNAs for microarrays, as outlined in the Methods section, into three sets of 9,216 cDNAs per array.

using the Qiagen-purified cDNA templates that were prepared for 3' sequencing (as opposed to amplification of the inserts directly from <italic>E. coli </italic>cultures containing the plasmid DNA). All 27,513 PCR reactions were performed with generic M13 forward and reverse primers using a robotic pipettor. Approximately 25% of the purified PCR cDNA inserts were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis for quality control. Of these, the average insert size was estimated to be 1,340 bp for library Gm-r1021, 1,110 bp for library Gm-r1070, 1,259 for library Gm-r1083, and 1,269 bp for library Gm-r1088.</p><p>The 9,216 amplified inserts of each set were singly spotted onto glass slides as outlined in the Methods section. A set of 64 control or 'choice' clones was assembled by hand into one 96-well plate (designated Gm-b10BB) and printed eight times repetitively throughout each array. Thus, the total number of spots on the array is 9,728 consisting of 9,216 cDNAs from the unigene set plus 512 (64 cDNAs &#x000d7; 8 repeats) from the choice clones. The choice clones were selected for various reasons. Some represent constitutively expressed genes (such as ubiquitin and EF1). Some are cDNAs whose expression is restricted to a subset of specific plant tissues (such as Rubisco or seed storage proteins). Some are clones of enzymes representing commonly used antibiotic resistance markers in transgenic plants (as hygromycin or kanamycin resistance), and 32 are cDNAs that represent at least 13 different enzymes of the flavonoid pathway. The flavonoid pathway was chosen because the corresponding genes often respond to many biotic and abiotic stress conditions and it has been widely studied in plant systems.</p></sec><sec><title>Soybean microarrays have potential to reveal the molecular basis of a mutant phenotype</title><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> illustrates an example of the reliability of the soybean microarray approach using dual labeled RNA probes from two near isogenic lines. These data illustrate the potential to discover novel genes by analysis of contrasting probes from mutant and normal lines. In this experiment, we compared two isogenic soybean lines that differ only at the <italic>T </italic>locus. The <italic>T </italic>locus controls the color of the pigment in the trichome hairs on the stems, leaves, and pods of the plant and also modifies the composition of the flavonoids and the color of the seed coats. Total RNA extracted from developing seed coats of line XB22A (<italic>T</italic>/<italic>T </italic>genotype) was labeled with Cy3 and compared to RNA extracted from the same stage of developing seed coats from an isoline containing the spontaneous mutation 37609 (<italic>t</italic>*/<italic>t</italic>* genotype) that was labeled with Cy5. A replicate experiment with a dye swap was also performed. Hybridizations were performed to microarrays constructed with the low redundancy set Gm-r1070 representing cDNAs from seeds, seed coats, and flowers. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> shows both replicates before and after the flagging and normalization procedures conducted as described in the Methods section. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, the normalization procedure serves to compensate within slide differences between the Cy3 and Cy5 intensity levels to shift the majority of spots to the line of equivalent expression between the isogenic lines. Also, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, very few of the 9,728 cDNAs on the array were reproducibly found to be expressed differentially in the two genotypes at levels higher or lower level than two-fold. A group of 16 of these (encircled by a line) are overexpressed in the <italic>T</italic>/<italic>T </italic>line relative to the <italic>t</italic>*/<italic>t</italic>* line by approximately three-fold. These cDNAs correspond to the flavonoid 3' hydroxylase cDNAs that were repetitively spotted on the array as members of the 'choice' clone set. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref> shows the Cy5 and Cy3 intensities and the ratios of the two replicate slides for all cDNA spots that exceeded a two-fold difference after normalizations within each slide and between the replicate slides. Only 23 cDNAs were found to have values that meet the criteria of exceeding a two-fold differences in both of the replicate slides. Of these 16 were the repetitively spotted flavonoid 3' hydroxylase cDNAs. Only an additional 22 cDNAs (known as partial hits) had values exceeding two-fold levels in one but not both of the slides replicates. Thus, out of over 9200 cDNAs represented on the array, there are relatively few that show differential expression between the RNAs in the normal and mutant lines.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>The scatter plots of the log values of expression data from two duplicate microarray slides before (left) and after flagging and normalization (right).

repetitively spotted flavonoid 3' hydroxylase cDNAs using a <italic>t </italic>test showed that the mean ratio of the repeated cDNAs on replicate 1 (2.424) were statistically significant at a P value of 0.0001 when compared to an expected mean of a 2.0, or a two-fold expression difference. The low P values were also found for replicate 2 and for the mean value (3.245) of both replicates. Thus, the flavonoid 3' hydroxylase cDNAs are statistically significant outliers in the microarray analysis.</p><p>The microarray data presented here and showing that the cytoplasmic levels of the flavonoid 3' hydroxylase are higher in the <italic>T</italic>/<italic>T </italic>line agree very well with RNA blot data which showed that the flavonoid 3' hydroxylase gene has reduced expression in the seed coats of the <italic>t</italic>*/<italic>t</italic>* isoline compared to the <italic>T</italic>/<italic>T </italic>lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In addition to the RNA blot data showing differences in these mutant lines, we have definitively shown that the flavonoid 3' hydroxylase is encoded by the <italic>T </italic>locus by sequence data of other alleles of the locus and by genetic cosegregation data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We do not know the reason for the change in the expression levels of the seven other cDNAs as shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>, most of them representing various seed or storage type proteins. While the <italic>T </italic>locus does determine the flavonoid and pigment compounds synthesized in various tissues including seed coats and trichomes, it is possible that the flavonoid compounds themselves modulate an additional effect on seed protein synthesis in the seed coats. Alternatively, the observed differences in the levels of these cDNAs could be due to an artifact during the dissection procedure. We know from Northern blots, that flavonoid 3' hydroxylase is highly expressed in the seed coats, but is not expressed in the cotyledons so any small amount of contaminating cotyledon cells due to imprecise dissection of the seed coats of one line versus the other could lead to observed differences in seed protein RNAs.</p><p>As this example in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref> illustrates, the use of dual labeled mRNAs from near isogenic lines to probe microarrays is a powerful approach with which to obtain a small list of candidate genes from among the thousands examined by microarray analysis. In this example only eight functionally different cDNAs (or seven if the two trypsin inhibitor cDNAs are counted as one) of over 9200 cDNAs spotted on the array met the criteria of exceeding two-fold levels of expression in both replicates. If a cDNA is repetitively spotted on an array, as were the flavonoid 3' hydroxylase cDNAs, then the data are statistically significant. After identifying a short list of candidate genes, it is then feasible to test them by other methods (as RNA blotting, quantitative RT-PCR, RFLP or SNP analysis) in order to find an association of a particular cDNA with the mutant phenotype. Of course, if a particular mutation has a regulatory or epigenetic effect on a large number of downstream RNAs, or if a mutation does not affect the abundance of an mRNA, then the global expression approach may not be effective in identifying the primary nature of the mutant locus. For example, the standard recessive <italic>t </italic>allele at the <italic>T </italic>locus is the result of a premature stop codon and does not affect abundance of the flavonoid 3' hydroxylase mRNA to the same extent as does the <italic>t</italic>* mutation at that locus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue specific gene expression using the soybean microarrays</title><p>In contrast to the results with near isogenic lines of the <italic>T </italic>locus which showed that relatively few cDNAs showed differential expression between the two very closely related lines, the soybean microarrays reveal larger numbers of cDNAs showing differential mRNA abundance levels in different tissue types of the same plants. For illustration, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> shows one of the two replicates of a dual labeling experiment using the low redundancy set Gm-r1088 of 9,216 cDNAs. The Cy3 labeled probe in this experiment was RNA from roots of hydroponically grown soybean plants, and the Cy5 probe was RNA from leaves of the same plants.

The 495 cDNAs (5.3% of the cDNAs on the array) that were differentially expressed were clustered into 11 sets using a non-hierarchical method (K-means) to reveal cDNAs with similar profiles in either the adaxial or the abaxial side of the embryos from 0 to 28 days in 7 day intervals. Among other conclusions, these global expression studies indicated that auxin induces dedifferentiation of the cotyledon and provokes a surge of cDNAs involved in cell division and oxidative burst.</p><p>Thus, the soybean cDNA arrays that we have developed from the unigene cDNA set can be used to reveal the underlying physiological and biochemical pathways potentially operative in specific tissues, developmental stages, or environmental treatments. Obviously, cDNA arrays from soybean or any other organism that are constructed with PCR inserts representing an average size of 1.1 kb will generally hybridize with any RNAs from gene family members that share greater than 85% homology. Thus, cDNA arrays will generally not distinguish expression from closely related duplicated sequences. Oligo arrays spotted with synthetic 70-mers or Affymetrix short oligo arrays have greater potential to separate the expression from close related duplicated sequences if the oligos are chosen from the 3' or 5' non-coding regions that carry more sequence variability than the protein coding regions.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Although microarray data is limited from soybean and most plants other than Arabidopsis, the construction of the 27,513 member low redundancy 'unigene' cDNAs for soybean reported in this paper will greatly stimulate this area. The number of slides containing all 27,513 of the cDNAs is being reduced to one, or at most two slides, and the slides are publicly available. Spotted PCR products with average size of over 1 kb are useful not only for soybean, but for other legume species as cross hybridization to the long probes will be substantial. The 3' sequencing reported here is particularly useful for differentiating gene family members and for future design of gene specific oligo arrays of either 70-mers spotted on glass slides or by Affymetrix technology using short oligos synthesized <italic>in situ</italic>. The cDNA or oligo-based microarrays add to the developing suite of genome analysis approaches in soybean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. A few of the unlimited applications include profiling expression from genes that respond to challenges by various pathogens and by environmental stresses as drought, heat, cold, flooding, and herbicide application. Also, by analysis of the near isogenic lines of the <italic>T </italic>locus as an example, we demonstrated the potential of soybean cDNA arrays to be used for discovery of genes responsible for uncharacterized mutations. Future expression profiling of mutant phenotypes or of genotypes that differ in protein or oil content and other quantitative traits will yield significant clues to the genes involved in those pathways and traits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Contig assembly for unigene selection</title><p>Raw sequence files of the 5' soybean EST data from Washington University or 3' data from the University of Illinois Keck Center were produced from sequence traces using the Phred base calling program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].
