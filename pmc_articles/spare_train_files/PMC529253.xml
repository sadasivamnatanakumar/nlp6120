Although neurotrophin transduction strategies are promising, alternative approaches such as the modulation of intrinsic neurotrophin expression by NSCs, could also be beneficial. Therefore, utilizing the C17.2 neural stem cell line, we have examined the expression of selected neurotrophic factors under different <italic>in vitro </italic>conditions. In view of recent evidence suggesting a role for the pineal hormone melatonin in vertebrate development, it was also of interest to determine whether its G protein-coupled MT<sub>1 </sub>and MT<sub>2 </sub>receptors are expressed in NSCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>RT-PCR analysis revealed robust expression of glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) in undifferentiated cells maintained for two days in culture. After one week, differentiating cells continued to exhibit high expression of BDNF and NGF, but GDNF expression was lower or absent, depending on the culture conditions utilized. Melatonin MT<sub>1 </sub>receptor mRNA was detected in NSCs maintained for two days in culture, but the MT<sub>2 </sub>receptor was not seen. An immature MT<sub>1 </sub>receptor of about 30 kDa was detected by western blotting in NSCs cultured for two days, whereas a mature receptor of about 40 &#x02013; 45 kDa was present in cells maintained for longer periods. Immunocytochemical studies demonstrated that the MT<sub>1 </sub>receptor is expressed in both neural (&#x003b2;-tubulin III positive) and glial (GFAP positive) progenitor cells. An examination of the effects of melatonin on neurotrophin expression revealed that low physiological concentrations of this hormone caused a significant induction of GDNF mRNA expression in NSCs following treatment for 24 hours.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The phenotypic characteristics of C17.2 cells suggest that they are a heterogeneous population of NSCs including both neural and glial progenitors, as observed under the cell culture conditions used in this study. These NSCs have an intrinsic ability to express neurotrophic factors, with an apparent suppression of GDNF expression after several days in culture. The detection of melatonin receptors in neural stem/progenitor cells suggests involvement of this pleiotropic hormone in mammalian neurodevelopment. Moreover, the ability of melatonin to induce GDNF expression in C17.2 cells supports a functional role for the MT<sub>1 </sub>receptor expressed in these NSCs. In view of the potency of GDNF in promoting the survival of dopaminergic neurons, these novel findings have implications for the utilization of melatonin in neuroprotective strategies, especially in Parkinson's disease.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Neural stem cells are multipotent cells which are capable of self-replication and differentiation into neurons, astrocytes or oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Because of their intrinsic plasticity and multipotency, there are great expectations that NSC transplantation will ultimately provide immense benefits in the treatment of neurodegeneration. However, it is essential to fully understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the differentiation and function of NSCs, in order to fully harness their therapeutic potential. Because of the very limited availability of NSCs in the central nervous system (CNS), neural stem cell lines are very useful for the study and characterization of NSC biology. For example, transplantation studies with the C17.2 neural stem cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] have revealed that these cells express diverse neurotransmitter phenotypes, depending on the environment prevailing in the CNS area of engraftment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Recently, transplanted C17.2 NSCs, genetically modified to express glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), were found to engraft in the 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned mouse striatum and to express therapeutic levels of this neurotrophin, with consequent protection of dopaminergic neurons in this model of Parkinson's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Although this and other similar approaches are promising, limitations including the stability and regulation of transduced genes await resolution. Therefore, it was of interest to determine whether C17.2 cells have the intrinsic ability to express neurotrophins or neurotrophic factors, which would make them amenable to modulation by appropriate agents <italic>in vitro or in vivo</italic>. In addition, we examined whether these NSCs express receptors for the pineal hormone melatonin, which can induce GDNF mRNA and protein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and which has been implicated in the development of vertebrates including humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Initially, different concentrations and types of sera were used for cell culture in order to select optimal conditions for gene expression studies. We now report that C17.2 NSCs exhibit heterogeneous phenotypes and express neurotrophic factors and melatonin MT<sub>1 </sub>receptors.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Effects of culture conditions on neurotrophic factor and cell-specific marker mRNA expression in C17.2 NSCs</title><p>Following two days in culture, C17.2 cells remain in an undifferentiated state, as indicated by their flat and rounded appearance (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) and high expression of the stem cell/progenitor cell marker, nestin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C,1E,1G</xref>). These cells also expressed the early neuronal marker, &#x003b2;-tubulin III, but there was little or no expression of the mRNA for the glial marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). After seven days in culture, differentiating C17.2 cells exhibit an elongated shape with an extension of neurite-like processes, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>. However, as observed in undifferentiated cells after two days, there was still strong expression of nestin and &#x003b2;-tubulin III, with little or no detectable GFAP mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D,1F,1H</xref>). An examination of neurotrophin mRNA expression in undifferentiated C17.2 cells, revealed a robust expression of GDNF, BDNF and NGF, regardless of the type or concentration of serum used for culturing (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C,1E,1G</xref>). A similar strong expression of BDNF and NGF was observed in differentiating cells after seven days, but GDNF mRNA was relatively lower in cells maintained in 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS) or 10% FBS + 5% horse serum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F,1H</xref>). The mRNA levels of the control gene, GAPDH, did not change under the conditions examined (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1I</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Detection of MT<sub>1 </sub>receptor mRNA and protein in C17.2 NSCs</title><p>Melatonin MT<sub>1 </sub>receptor mRNA was detected by RT-PCR in NSCs maintained for two days, especially in cells cultured in 1% FBS, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>. GAPDH mRNA expression did not change under the conditions examined (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). C17.2 NSCs maintained for indicated periods in 1% FBS or 10% FBS + 5% horse serum, expressed the MT<sub>1 </sub>receptor protein, as revealed by western analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C,2D</xref>). Interestingly, when cells were cultured for 2&#x02013;3 days, the MT<sub>1 </sub>protein detected had a molecular weight of about 30 kDa, which is less than the predicted size of the mature receptor. However, when cells were cultured for 10&#x02013;12 days, a mature MT<sub>1 </sub>receptor of about 40&#x02013;45 kDa was present, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>. The MT<sub>2 </sub>receptor transcript was not detected under any of the conditions used in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunocytochemical detection of the MT<sub>1 </sub>receptor and cell-specific markers in C17.2 NSCs</title><p>MT<sub>1 </sub>receptor immunoreactivity was detected within C17.2 cells maintained in 1% FBS for two days, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,3B</xref>. Omission of the primary antibody or its preincubation with a blocking peptide (CIDtech Research Inc., Cambridge, ON) abolished MT<sub>1 </sub>immunoreactivity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), indicating the specificity of MT<sub>1 </sub>detection. In keeping with RT-PCR results, nestin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D,3E</xref>) and &#x003b2;-tubulin III (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>), were detected by immunocytochemical analysis. Double- labeling studies indicated that the MT<sub>1 </sub>receptor is coexpressed with the stem /progenitor cell marker, nestin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A,4B,4C</xref>), the glial marker, GFAP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D,4E,4F</xref>) and the early neuronal marker, &#x003b2;-tubulin III (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G,4H,4I</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Induction of GDNF mRNA expression by melatonin in C17.2 NSCs</title><p>In order to assess the potential functionality of the MT<sub>1 </sub>receptor detected in C17.2 NSCs, the effect of low physiological concentrations of melatonin on GDNF mRNA expression was examined. Cells were grown as described in Methods and treated with melatonin or vehicle (0.001% DMSO) for 24 hours. Following RT-PCR analysis, GDNF mRNA levels were converted to optical density (OD) values and normalized to GAPDH OD levels, as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. After conversion of GDNF/GAPDH OD ratios to percentage values, one-way ANOVA indicated a significant treatment effect (F<sub>3,7 </sub>= 7.03, p &#x0003c; 0.04). A Neuman-Keuls test indicated a significant increase in relative GDNF mRNA expression in cells treated with 0.05, 0.1 and 1 nM melatonin as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The expression of nestin in undifferentiated C17.2 cells is consistent with the presence of this intermediate filament protein in stem and progenitor cells in the mammalian CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, as noted above, nestin mRNA was also readily detected in cells exhibiting morphological changes characteristic of differentiation, after one week in culture. Similarly, mRNA for the early neuronal marker, &#x003b2;-tubulin III, was found under all conditions examined, whereas GFAP mRNA was detected only in some cultures. These observations suggest that the C17.2 cells examined in this study are an heterogeneous population of stem and progenitor cells in keeping with evidence that NSCs exhibit morphological and phenotypic heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The expression of diverse neurotrophins by NSCs is consistent with the role of these factors in the differentiation and development of the CNS. Presumably, the robust mRNA expression observed, particularly in cells maintained in 10% FBS + 5% HS, is driven by the serum-enriched milieu of potential inducers including neurotransmitters, hormones and growth factors, such as basic fibroblast growth factor and epidermal growth factor, which can stimulate C17.2 cell growth <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In contrast to BDNF and NGF, which exhibited strong mRNA expression under all conditions examined, GDNF expression was weaker or not detectable in differentiating cells after seven days in culture. The suppression of GDNF expression might have been due to the prolonged exposure of NSCs to regulatory factors in the serum, as its decline appears to be inversely correlated with the concentration or enrichment of serum used for cell culture. Thus, moderate, weak or no expression of GDNF was observed in cells cultured for 1 week in 1% CS, 1% FBS or 10% FBS + 5% HS, respectively (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D,1F,1H</xref>). Various biological agents or pathways have been implicated in the regulation of GDNF expression. For example, fibroblast growth factor-2 and proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin(IL)-1&#x003b2;, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1; stimulate GDNF synthesis and secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Activation of protein kinase C by phorbol esters increases GDNF expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], whereas the adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin, inhibits GDNF production in cultured cells, suggesting an inhibitory role for the cyclic AMP- protein kinase A pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The cAMP pathway and its transcriptional factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) have been shown to induce differentiation in neuronal progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that activation of this pathway was involved in both the initiation of differentiation and the inhibition of GDNF expression observed in C17.2 cells after seven days.</p><p>While this work was in progress, it was reported that C17.2 neural stem cells constitutively secrete BDNF, GDNF and NGF, but do not label for GFAP or neuronal markers like &#x003b2;-tubulin III [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Our findings are in agreement with these observations with regard to neurotrophin expression. However, in contrast to their findings, &#x003b2;-tubulin III mRNA and immunoreactivity were readily detected in our study. In addition, although GFAP mRNA was weakly expressed or not detectable in some cultures, immunoreactivity for this glial cell marker is present in C17.2 cells, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. These differences may be due to our examination of &#x003b2;-tubulin III and GFAP expression in cells maintained for 2&#x02013;12 days in culture, whereas their C17.2 cells were examined after 2&#x02013;3 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Other factors, such as our use of low serum concentrations, as compared with the enriched culture medium used by Lu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], may also be involved. The detection of melatonin MT<sub>1 </sub>receptor mRNA in C17.2 cells after 2 days but not after 7 days, presumably involves downregulation of this receptor. There is considerable evidence that many G protein-coupled receptors are downregulated by their agonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. More importantly, melatonin, which is present in serum, has been found to suppress MT<sub>1 </sub>transcription <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Interestingly, our immunocytochemical studies revealed MT<sub>1 </sub>immunoreactivity within C17.2 cell bodies and extensions, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A,3B</xref>. Although an intracellular localization could result from internalization of receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], it is also possible that the immunoreactivity detected within these neural stem/progenitor cells is due to the presence of newly synthesized MT<sub>1 </sub>receptors. In accordance with this view, the MT<sub>1</sub> protein detected in short-term (2-day) cultures is about 30 kDa, which is less than the approximately 37&#x02013;45 kDa molecular weight observed in various mammalian tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Moreover, when cells were cultured for 10&#x02013;12 days, a MT<sub>1 </sub>receptor of about 40&#x02013;45 kDa was detected, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>. The mammalian MT<sub>1 </sub>contains two glycosylation sites in its N-terminal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and it may exist in more than one glycosylated form, as has been reported for other G protein-coupled receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Thus, the above cytochemical observations suggest that newly synthesized immature MT<sub>1 </sub>receptors,which have yet to undergo posttranslational modification and translocation to the plasma membrane, were detected in cells cultured for 2 days in 1% FBS, whereas a mature glycosylated receptor was present in cells grown for longer periods. Although the MT<sub>2 </sub>receptor transcript was not detected under any of the conditions used in this study, additional studies are required before the possibility of its expression in these cells can be ruled out. It is possible that MT<sub>2 </sub>mRNA may undergo rapid turnover/degradation, while a functional protein may still be present. This is the first evidence that melatonin receptors are expressed in neural stem or progenitor cells and raises the obvious question of whether this hormone plays a role in neuronal development. Although studies in this field are limited, there is increasing evidence that melatonin is involved in the early development of vertebrates. For example, melatonin is produced in chick embryos as early as the 7<sup>th </sup>day of embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and a physiological concentration of this hormone has been shown to significantly enhance mouse embryogenesis <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Similarly, when sheep blastocysts were treated with melatonin for 24 hr <italic>in vitro</italic>, there was a significant increase in the percentage of embryonic survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Other studies have shown that functional G<sub>i </sub>protein-coupled melatonin receptors, which mediate inhibition of the adenylate-cyclase-cAMP pathway, are present in the embryonic (day 8) neural retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Melatonin receptor transcripts for all the known G<sub>i </sub>protein-coupled receptor subtypes have been found in 24 hr-old embryos from Japanese quail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Various studies have detected melatonin receptors in human fetal brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and peripheral tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Moreover, recent autoradiographic and <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization studies indicate that the melatonin MT<sub>1 </sub>receptor is expressed in diverse areas of the human fetal brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Thus, the presence of MT<sub>1 </sub>receptors in NSCs is in keeping with the foregoing, and supports the view that melatonin is involved in neurodevelopment. Colocalization evidence that the MT<sub>1 </sub>receptor is present in both neural and glial progenitor cells is consistent with a neurodevelopmental role for melatonin, and suggests that in addition to the presence of the MT<sub>1 </sub>in mammalian neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], it may also be expressed in astrocytes, as observed in similar cells from rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and chick brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The detection of nestin in some cells expressing the MT<sub>1 </sub>receptor is consistent with its presence not only in neural progenitor cells but also in GFAP positive glial progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Preliminary evidence that melatonin induces GDNF mRNA expression in C17.2 NSCs, as we have observed previously in C6 glioma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], supports the foregoing as this neurotrophic factor plays a critical role in both central and peripheral neurodevelopment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. GDNF also exerts neuroprotective effects in the CNS, including a potent role in the survival of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Therefore, modulation of GDNF expression may be one of the mechanisms underlying physiological neuroprotection by melatonin in the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, the NSCs utilized in this study exhibited an intrinsic ability to express neurotrophins under various cell culture conditions. This ability was not affected by their morphological state, except in the case of GDNF mRNA expression which was lower in cells undergoing differentiation in FBS-supplemented media. Novel evidence that neural stem/progenitor cells express MT<sub>1 </sub>receptors adds to the increasing evidence that NSCs can respond to diverse modulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], and suggests an early role for melatonin in CNS development. Moreover, since melatonin induces GDNF expression in NSCs, its potential <italic>in vivo </italic>modulation of this and/or other neurotrophic factors, via its G protein-coupled receptors in the brain or on transplanted NSCs, could have important implications for optimizing therapeutic strategies in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The C17.2 cell line was derived by retrovirus-mediated oncogene (<italic>v-myc</italic>) transduction of cells from the external germinal layer of neonatal mouse cerebellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].

For double- labeling studies of the MT<sub>1 </sub>and cell markers, a rhodamine (TRITC)-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (1: 100; Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs. Inc.,West Grove, PA) was used to detect nestin, GFAP and &#x003b2;-tubulin III. Digital images were recorded on a Zeiss confocal microscope.</p></sec><sec><title>Western analysis</title><p>C17.2 NSCs were grown as described in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, and proteins were extracted in a modified RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with PMSF (1 mM), aprotinin (2 &#x003bc;g/ml), leupeptin (2 &#x003bc;g/ml), and sodium orthovanadate (2 mM). Extracted proteins (80 &#x003bc;g per lane) were separated by SDS- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transblotted to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-T buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20; pH 8.5) for 1 hour at room temperature, and then incubated overnight with a 1:100 dilution of rabbit anti-MT<sub>1 </sub>antibody (CIDTech Research Inc., Cambridge, ON) at 4&#x000b0;C. After washing, membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 hour. Following washing and exposure to enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Baie d'Urf&#x000e9;, Qu&#x000e9;bec) for about 5 minutes, proteins were detected by autoradiography, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Buffer reagents and protease inhibitors were obtained from Sigma- Aldrich Canada Ltd. (Oakville, ON).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LPN conceived and planned the study, designed PCR primers, supervised all aspects of the study and wrote the manuscript.
