This decision is extensively modulated by the cytokine microenvironment, which includes a broad array of cytokines whose direct effect on MPs remains largely unexplored. Therefore, we tested whether polarized responses of MPs to pathogens are related to the influence of selected cytokines or represent a mandatory molecular switch through which most cytokines operate.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Circulating CD14<sup>+ </sup>MPs were exposed to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) followed by exposure to an array of cytokines, chemokines and soluble factors involved in the immune response. Gene expression was studied by global transcript analysis. Two main classes of cytokines were identified that induced a classical or an alternative pathway of MP activation. Expression of genes affected by NF&#x003ba;B activation was most predictive of the two main classes, suggesting that this pathway is a fundamental target of cytokine regulation. As LPS itself induces a classical type of activation, the most dramatic modulation was observed toward the alternative pathway, suggesting that a broad array of cytokines may counteract the pro-inflammatory effects of bacterial components.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This analysis is directly informative of the primary effect of individual cytokines on the early stages of LPS stimulation and, therefore, may be most informative of the way MP maturation may be polarized at the early stages of the immune response.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Resident and recruited mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) display a versatile phenotype that reflects the plasticity of these cells in response to microenvironmental signals. This heterogeneity spans a continuous spectrum that can be polarized into two extremes recently described by Mantovani <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Pathogen stimulation exemplified, for instance, by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in the presence of interferon (IFN)-&#x003b3; induces M1 MPs through engagement of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). M1 MPs are true antigen-presenting cells capable not only of killing invading organisms but of concomitantly recruiting and activating immune effector cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Treatment of MPs with type II cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13 and, partly, IL-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], polarizes their function towards tissue repair, angiogenesis and containment of collateral damage through reduction of inflammation (the M2 macrophage phenotype). This alternative mode of macrophage activation accounts for a distinct phenotype with a key role in humoral immunity and tissue repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>It has been suggested that the extreme dichotomy between a classical M1 and an alternative M2 polarization of macrophage function may not take into account intermediate regulation by cytokines such as IL-10, transforming growth factors (TGF-&#x003b1; and TGF-&#x003b2;), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), IFN-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b2; and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Most important, a rigid dichotomy in MP function may not directly apply to physiological and/or pathological conditions in which these cells are exposed to an array of cytokines produced by innate or adaptive immune mechanisms during infection, tissue damage or in other conditions. Indeed, a comprehensive overview of the modulatory properties of cytokines on the MP reaction to a pathogen is missing. In addition, little is known about the transcriptional changes occurring in MPs on exposure to pathogen components such as LPS.</p><p>A recent study analyzed the transcriptional profile induced by the exposure of circulating MP conditioned <italic>in vitro </italic>for 7 days with IL-4 and GM-CSF (immature dendritic cell, (DC)) to pathogen components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Bacterial, viral and fungal components elicited distinctive pathways that were, however, largely overlapping. The predominant response of these DCs to most pathogen components encompassed a rapid upregulation of genes associated with the innate arm of the immune response followed by induction of adaptive immune response genes.</p><p>The response of circulating MP-derived DCs is short-lived as these cells can exhaust their production of effector molecules (cytokines and chemokines) within a few hours of LPS stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The transience of mRNA and protein expression can cause DCs to redirect the immune response in different ways at different time points. For instance, soon after stimulation, DCs elicit T-cell responses of the Th-1 type, whereas at later stage of activation they prime T-cell responses of the Th-2 type, suggesting that their function is strongly dependent on the timing and duration of exposure to individual and/or combined stimulatory conditions in the surrounding microenvironment. At the transcriptional level, the dual function of DCs shifted from an early pre-inflammatory phase occurring within 3 hours to a later regulatory phase occurring approximately 8 hours following LPS exposure. During these evolving stages of DC activation, cytokines play a dominant role in shaping the function of DCs and other immune cells, providing a malleable link between the innate and adaptive immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In natural conditions, circulating or resident MPs may encounter a pathogen before the surrounding microenvironment has a chance to influence their maturation. Therefore, it is unknown whether non-conditioned circulating CD14<sup>+ </sup>MPs would react similarly to DCs on engagement with infectious agents. Thus, a preliminary aim of this study was to evaluate the kinetics of the response of non-conditioned circulating CD14<sup>+ </sup>MP to LPS. The results suggested that these cells respond to LPS similarly to immature CD14<sup>- </sup>DCs, with a surge in transcriptional activity that peaks around 3 hours after stimulation and in which the activation of genes associated with a classical activation of innate immune mechanisms predominates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The stringent dichotomy describing a classical activation of MPs into mature antigen-presenting cells caused by IFN-&#x003b3; and an alternative induction into macrophages induced by IL-4 and IL-13 may not apply to physiological conditions in which the microenvironment responds to pathogen exposure with a broad array of cytokine secretion. We therefore investigated whether polarized responses of MPs to pathogens are extreme behaviors that can be observed <italic>in vitro </italic>by studying a few illustrative cytokines or whether they represent a mandatory molecular switch through which most cytokines operate. Thus, we stimulated non-conditioned CD14<sup>+ </sup>MPs with LPS for 1 hour. The MPs were then exposed to an array of different cytokines that may be expressed in distinct pathologic conditions by different immune-cell subsets. The 1-hour interval was empirically selected to induce a biphasic model in which the presumed modulation by cytokines occurred during an ongoing reaction to LPS. This allowed mapping of cytokines into conditional subclasses based on their effects on the global transcriptional changes responsible for MP activation and differentiation.</p><p>Two main classes of cytokines were identified that induced a classical or alternative pathway of MP activation, respectively. An intermediate class (including IL-10) was also identified, while TNF-&#x003b1;, TNF-&#x003b2; and GM-CSF displayed a quite distinct behavior from the other cytokines. Expression of genes affected by NF&#x003ba;B activation was most predictive of the two main classes, suggesting that in most cases the NF&#x003ba;B pathway is a central target of cytokine regulation that modulates the cascade of events following LPS stimulation. Overall, it seems that MP maturation/differentiation goes through a molecular switch that is partly independent of the fine differences in the stimulatory properties of the various cytokines and, with few exceptions, is pre-programmed towards a classical or an alternative route. As LPS itself induces a classical type of activation, the most dramatic modulation in this model was observed toward the alternative pathway, suggesting that a broad array of cytokines may counteract the pro-inflammatory effects of bacterial components.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Effect of LPS stimulation on circulating CD14<sup>+ </sup>MPs</title><p>Enriched MP preparations (about 90% CD14<sup>+</sup>) were exposed to LPS. Total RNA extracts were obtained 4 and 9 hours after. These time points were selected to catch salient stages of the biphasic response of MP to LPS described by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Amplified antisense RNA (aRNA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] was hybridized to a custom-made 17,000 (17K)-clone cDNA microarray chip enriched with genes relevant to immune function. The transcriptional profile of LPS-induced MPs was similar to that described by others in DCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In particular, genes associated with the innate response of CD14<sup>-</sup>, immature DCs to pathogen components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] were similarly upregulated in CD14<sup>+ </sup>MPs (data not shown). This finding suggests that the differential expression of the LPS co-receptor CD14 between the two cell populations has a relatively minor impact on the transcriptional regulation of the innate immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Kinetics of the response of CD14<sup>+ </sup>MPs to LPS and its modulation by cytokines</title><p>Aliquots of CD14<sup>+ </sup>MPs were stimulated in parallel with LPS and exposed 1 hour later to individual cytokines selected from a library of recombinant proteins possibly relevant to MP regulation. MPs were kept in culture for 4 and 9 hours, at which times aRNA was prepared for transcriptional analysis. Unsupervised Eisen's clustering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] was applied to the complete dataset (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The kinetics of the response to LPS had the greatest influence on the global transcriptional profile of MP induction; samples preferentially clustered according to time of stimulation rather than type of treatment. This was underlined by the observation that MPs stimulated with LPS alone clustered with the cytokine-stimulated MPs according to the time elapsed after stimulation. In addition, a cluster containing most of the samples obtained 9 hours after stimulation (9') included three control samples consisting of CD14<sup>+ </sup>MPs not exposed to LPS or cytokines (no stimulation). These three samples were prepared at times 0, 4 and 9 hours to parallel the culture conditions used for stimulation. This finding suggested that the transcriptional profile of CD14<sup>+ </sup>MPs 9 hours after LPS stimulation and 8 hours after treatment with most cytokines converges toward a less reactive metabolic state closer to that of unstimulated MPs. Several cytokines, however, maintained a more active metabolic profile and after 9 hours retained a transcriptional footprint relatively close to that of samples treated for 4 hours (9"). This group included the genes for most IFN-&#x003b1; isoforms, IFN-&#x003b2;, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), FLT-3 ligand, TGF-&#x003b1;, the chemokine RANTES (CCL5), IL-2, IL-4, IL-15 and the chemokines MIP1&#x003b1; (CCL3) and MIP1&#x003b2; (CCL4), suggesting that these cytokines may have relatively prolonged kinetics of MP activation.</p><p>The average number of genes whose expression was increased compared to unstimulated MPs was higher (420 genes) after 4 hours than after 9 hours (265 genes). About half of the genes upregulated after 4 hours remained upregulated at 9 hours (223 genes). This is in accordance with Huang's observation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] that transcriptional changes in DCs occur predominantly in the early phase of the response to pathogen components, with about half the genes displaying transitory expression and the other half sustained expression. For this reason, subsequent analyses were limited to the 4-hour time point.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptional modulation by cytokines 4 hours after LPS stimulation of CD14<sup>+ </sup>MPs</title><p>Although LPS alone strongly affected the transcriptional program of MPs, it was possible to discern the contribution of individual cytokines. This analysis was limited to samples treated for 4 hours, when the most dramatic effects on gene modulation were noted. Genes differentially expressed in samples treated with cytokines compared to those treated with LPS alone were identified. Stringent criteria were applied to select genes expressed in at least 80% of samples with a threefold or greater increase or reduction in expression over LPS in at least one of the cytokine-treated samples. This gave 2,057 genes that were deemed most relevant to the analysis. Using these genes, all cytokine-treated samples were subjected to unsupervised clustering to evaluate their relatedness (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>).</p><p>Two main classes of cytokines were identified. One class (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>, blue horizontal line) included IL-4, IL-13 TGF-&#x003b1;, TGF-&#x003b2; and VEGF, which are unquestionably associated with the alternative pathway of MP activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The second class (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>, red line) included IFN-&#x003b1;2, IFN-&#x003b2;, IFN-&#x003b3;, CD40 ligand (CD40L), and FLT-3 ligand, which are generally associated with the classical pathway of MP activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Therefore, we considered the first cluster representative of the alternative and the second of the classical pathway of MP activation in response to LPS. As predicted by Gordon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], few cytokines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>, green line) did not properly belong to either class. These included IL-10, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-15 and two IFN-&#x003b1; isoforms. Because several of these cytokines have previously been associated with the alternative pathway, we referred to this class as alternative II. Not surprisingly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], MPs stimulated with TNF-&#x003b1; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>, purple line) and, most dramatically, TNF-&#x003b2; and GM-CSF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>, black line) had a totally independent effect on the transcriptional regulation of LPS-induced CD14<sup>+ </sup>MPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Cytokines classified according to the previous groups were tested for class prediction by applying unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) to the global, unfiltered 17K gene dataset (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). This analysis independently classified cytokines in two groups corresponding to the alternative (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>, blue circles) and classical (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>, red circles) cytokine classes. Most of the cytokines belonging to the alternative II class (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>, green circles) grouped with the alternative group, whereas TNF-&#x003b1; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>, purple circle and arrow), TNF-&#x003b2; and GM-CSF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>, gray circles) remained separate. The sample treated with LPS alone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>, yellow circle and arrow) grouped with the classical cytokines, confirming the predominant pro-inflammatory effects of this bacterial product and its alignment with the classical pathway of MP activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This finding based on the complete dataset indicates the intrinsic bias of this study aimed at exploring the alternative modulation of the MP response to LPS.</p><p>Particular mention should be made of the erratic behavior of various IFN-&#x003b1; subtypes, which clustered indiscriminately between the two main cytokine classes. Interestingly, however, alignment of the IFN-&#x003b1; protein sequences through the EMBL-EBI Clustal W database identified, with the exception of IFN-&#x003b1;G, a close relationship among the IFN-&#x003b1; subtypes that clustered with the alternative type of cytokines (data not shown). This subclassification was also supported by the phylogenetic relationship among interferons described by Henco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This information suggests that specific domains of the IFN-&#x003b1; molecules may have dramatically different effects in the modulation of the MP response to pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Interestingly, IFN-&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>, which is the one most commonly used in clinical trials as a pro-inflammatory cytokine, clustered with the classical cytokines adjacent to IFN-&#x003b3;.</p></sec><sec><title>Cytokine-mediated modulation of LPS-stimulated CD14<sup>+ </sup>MPs predominantly affects pathways downstream of NF&#x003ba;B</title><p>Signatures associated with several pathways of immune-cell activation were constructed by selecting genes from the global pool of 17K clones according to literature information without pre-existing information about the association of their expression to either class of cytokines. Signature genes were then subjected to supervised clustering according to the cytokine classification shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>. This independent process identified virtual signatures, in some cases portraying opposite transcriptional regulation by the two classes. The signature that most strongly discriminated the two classes comprised 121 genes whose expression is closely dependent on NF&#x003ba;B modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). This is not surprising as LPS acts through engagement of Toll receptor 4 (TLR4) and CD14, with resulting activation of NF&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. It would, therefore, seem intuitive that the strongest modulation in the present experimental conditions would target this pathway. In particular, several TNF- and IL-1-related genes classically modulated by NF&#x003ba;B during the acute phases of the innate immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] were strongly and inversely modulated by the two cytokine classes.</p><p>The same 121 genes were used for unsupervised class prediction by reclustering cytokine-treated samples (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). This independent analysis segregated cytokines into two classes that with the exception of one (IFN-&#x003b1;2b) matched the respective original classical and alternative classification (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>, red and blue horizontal bars, respectively). Interestingly, the cytokines that belonged to the alternative II class clustered with the alternative cytokines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>, green horizontal bars) while TNF-&#x003b1; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>, purple horizontal bar), TNF-&#x003b2;, and GM-CSF (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>, dark gray horizontal bar) clustered separately but in proximity of the classical group. Analysis of early signaling events occurring 1 hour and 30 minutes after LPS stimulation and, therefore, 30 minutes after the additional cytokine exposure, demonstrated significantly increased levels of the free p50 subunit of NF&#x003ba;B in MP whole-cell extracts treated with alternative class cytokines (IL-4 and IL-13). In addition, IL-1&#x003b1; and TNF-&#x003b1; significantly upregulated p50, whereas no significant changes were caused by classical cytokines (IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-6 and IL-3). Extracts from MPs stimulated only with LPS also failed to demonstrate changes in NF&#x003ba;B subunit release; this is probably related to the 90-minute period from stimulation that allowed a return of signaling molecules to baseline conditions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>). The similarity of the IL-1&#x003b1; and TNF-&#x003b1; effects on p50 to those of alternative cytokines contrasts with the dramatic differences observed on the respective transcriptional profiles, suggesting that other pathways induced by these cytokines may prevail in the conditions tested here.</p><p>Among the additional pathways tested, those mediated through STATs, Janus kinases (JAKs), and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) did not appear consequential to the experimental conditions tested in this study (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Cytokine-mediated modulation of metalloproteinase expression in LPS-stimulated CD14<sup>+ </sup>MPs</title><p>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are tightly connected to MP activation. MMP released by MPs contribute to normal and pathological tissue remodeling and MP migration. In addition MMP function as regulatory proteins by promoting the activation or degradation of cytokines. Finally, MMP are susceptible to cytokine stimulation. Thirty-six MMP and MMP-related genes (filtered from a larger group of 184 MMPs, disintegrins, &#x003b1;-defensins, TGF-&#x003b2;, TNF-&#x003b1;, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), IL-1 and monocyte chemotactic protein-3 (CCL7/MCP-3) genes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] were clustered according to the alternative and classical group denomination and the 11 most representative are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. The alternative group of cytokines induced the transcription of MMPs (MMP 7, 9, 10, 19), enzymes related to MMP function (disintegrin ADAM 9, pro-collagen proline dioxygenase, MEK1 kinase, serine protease inhibitor, cathepsin L) and structural proteins (gap junction connexin 26, laminin A/C). This confirms the role of alternative MP activation in promoting tissue remodeling, cell-cell interactions and local control of the inflammatory process through activation (via MMP-7, 9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] or degradation (via MMP-19) of cytokine activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In addition, these observations suggest a role for the cytokines in the alternative group (other than the well documented IL-4 or IL-13) in polarizing MPs toward an M2 regulatory phenotype.</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of the alternative and classical groups of cytokines</title><p>Comparison of gene-expression patterns induced by the two cytokine classes (classical and alternative) identified 2,007 genes that were differentially expressed at a less than 0.001 significance level (<italic>t</italic>-test, p<sub>2</sub>-value). Genes associated with immune function were proportionally over-represented. A selection of genes relevant to MP function is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. In most cases, the pattern of expression echoed the class allocation suggested by the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Classical cytokines induced genes responsible for the cytotoxic and migratory properties of MPs such as those for CD95, TRAIL, granzymes, perforin, CD16 (stimulatory Fc&#x003b3; receptor) and CD62L. In addition, antigen presentation was enhanced as suggested by the coordinate expression of several HLA class II genes. IFN-&#x003b3; and the other classical cytokines inhibited the expression of the macrophage-derived chemokine CCL22/MDC, while upregulating the expression of CXCR3, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Alternative cytokines induced the expression of several cytokines and their respective receptors involved in the chemotaxis and activation of neutrophils, MPs, natural killer (NK) cells, DCs, helper T lymphocytes (Th2) and B lymphocytes. Several genes known to be associated with alternative MP activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] were consistently upregulated. These included the mannose receptor, the inhibitory Fc-IIb receptor CD32, and the cell-surface molecule CD44 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], which is associated with the disposal of inflammatory cell corpses without expansion of the inflammatory process. Several inducible chemokines were expressed in response to alternative stimulation such as CCL22/MDC, supporting the emerging role of this cytokine as an enhancer of polarized Th2 responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Other chemokines known to be induced by master type II cytokines and associated with the induction of Th2 responses were also induced by alternative activation; these included CCL11 (eotaxin), CCL1 (I-309), CCL2 (MCP-1) and CCL7 (MCP-3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Of interest was the relatively higher expression of IL-24, a cytokine belonging to the IL-10 family constitutively expressed by MPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Although the true role of this cytokine in inflammatory processes is not known, it is likely that its pro-apoptotic and angioregulatory properties have important roles in tissue repair and remodeling during inflammation. Finally, various chemokine receptors responsible for MP trafficking and localization were differentially regulated by the two cytokine groups, including in particular CCR1 and CCR5, which were induced by alternative stimulation, and CCR2, induced by classical stimulation.</p><p>This early transcriptional profile underlines the primary role of MPs during the acute phases of the response to pathogen as effector cells that can kill pathogens, take up antigen and migrate to local regional lymph nodes to recruit adaptive immune responses (classical activation). In contrast, alternative cytokines may be produced in the microenvironment to maintain a resident MP phenotype rich in chemokine production, which can attract Th2-type immune responses while continuing pathogen clearance through retention of phagocyte properties and promoting tissue remodeling.</p><p>Surprisingly, genes of the IL-1 family and its receptors, TNF and IL-6 were consistently upregulated by the alternative class of cytokines, suggesting that LPS alters MP polarization with regard to these cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Particularly interesting is the alternative induction of IL-6 and its receptor, which may play a central role in mediating the transition from neutrophils to MP recruitment during progression from acute to chronic inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Validation of microarray analysis by TaqMan real-time PCR</title><p>To define the validity and accuracy of our global microarray analysis, quantitative TaqMan real-time PCR was performed on amplified RNA material isolated after stimulation of monocytes obtained from five additional normal donors with representative cytokines/soluble factors selected from the alternative and from the classical groups. Comparison of monocyte stimulation with a candidate cytokine from the alternative/M2 (IL-4) and the classical/M1 (IFN-&#x003b3;) group, respectively, is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>. Ten genes whose expression was upregulated by alternative cytokines were tested, as the thrust of the analysis was the evaluation of the effect of alternative cytokines on LPS-stimulated MPs. The relative expression of five genes out of 10 (IL-1&#x003b1;, IL-1 receptor, mannose receptor, NFKb-p105/50 and TRAF) was significantly higher after treatment with IL-4, as suggested by the array data. Also, the expression profiles of the other genes tested reproduced the pattern observed in the array experiments even if they did not reach statistical significance for each individual gene. This is not surprising because array experiments summarize in signature fine differences in gene expression, that often describe patterns rather than absolute significance for individual genes.</p><p>Reproducibility of the estimates of mannose receptor, NFKb-p105/50 and TRAF gene expression in MPs obtained from the same five donors was evaluated after stimulation with four cytokines/soluble factors selected from the alternative (IL-13, IL-1&#x003b1;, IL-4, TGF-&#x003b2;) and four from the classical groups (FLT-3 ligand, IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-3, CD40L) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). In all cases gene expression significantly reflected the pattern of gene expression detected by microarray analysis (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>It has been suggested that MP activation and maturation progresses through a polarized mechanism whereby two extreme products result that promote inflammation on one side and tissue repair on the other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The first mechanism has been called the classical pathway of MP activation. It induces M1 monocytes specialized for pathogen killing and activation of innate and adaptive immune effector cells. A second, alternative, pathway induces M2-type monocytes committed to clearing pathogen through internal metabolism while reducing inflammation. This process limits the collateral damage induced by an excessive immune response, and, upon cessation of the pathogenic stimulus, promotes tissue repair. This dichotomy is based on the study of a few cytokines deemed representative of the classical mode (LPS, IFN-&#x003b3;) or the alternative mode (IL-4, IL-13) of MP activation. Other cytokines such as IL-10, TGF, M-CSF, IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; and TNF, although partially overlapping both pathways, display functional effects that diverge significantly enough that they would be inaccurately grouped in either class [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>In this study we evaluated whether MP commitment is dependent on an early bipolar switch through which most cytokines operate. This was done by testing in parallel a library of 42 stimulatory molecules possibly present in the tissue microenvironment following a pathogenic insult. This modulation was tested on MPs triggered by a pathogenic stimulus, exemplified in this case by LPS. This was done on the assumption that in most circumstances resident or migratory MPs reaching an infected area are exposed concomitantly to a pathogen and to the cytokine milieu resulting from the infection. The transcriptional profile identified by this study cannot distinguish between the direct effect of each soluble factor analyzed and the downstream activation of transcriptional pathways by secondary paracrine or autocrine secretion of biological modifiers by MPs. However, the main goal of this study was to identify the overall effect on MPs of the exposure to individual cytokines. Future analyses, focused on specific cytokine patterns described here, should possibly include the addition of blocking antibodies to segregate secondary from primary MP responses.</p><p>The results suggest that MP activation is in most cases a bipolar process regulated by an internal switch through which cytokines modulate the <italic>yin </italic>and <italic>yang </italic>of the MP transcriptional program. In fact, most cytokines preferentially induced one or other pattern of transcriptional activation. We, therefore, mapped most of the cytokines within a classical or an alternative classification according to their effects on CD14<sup>+</sup>, LPS-induced MPs. In particular, it appeared that transcriptional programs down-stream of NF&#x003ba;B activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] were mostly associated with either class, suggesting that the NF&#x003ba;B system is at the center of the switch regulating MP activation/differentiation in the conditions tested in the present study. This is not surprising as LPS signaling is mediated through the TLR-4 and CD14, which in turn directly regulate the I&#x003ba;B kinase (IKK)-NF&#x003ba;B pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. It appears that cytokine regulation modulates the release of the p50 subunit of NF&#x003ba;B, whch is in turn responsible for the downstream effects on the transcriptional program. Interestingly, reclustering of cytokines based on NF&#x003ba;B-dependent genes consolidated the two classes of cytokines adding TNF-&#x003b1; and TNF-&#x003b2;, IFN-&#x003b1;<sub>2b </sub>and GM-CSF to the classical group and the alternative type II cytokines with the alternative group, suggesting that NF&#x003ba;B may be central to MP polarization.</p><p>This information cannot of course be generalized to other conditions as the model tested is strongly biased by NF&#x003ba;B induction by LPS. This is underlined by the unexpected alternative upregulation of genes associated with IL-1, TNF and IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This observation suggests that in different conditions, cytokines may differently modulate MP activation, possibly through various modulatory feedback mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In addition, genes associated with the interrelated arginine and tryptophan pathways that modulate nitric oxide induction and are indirectly associated with NF&#x003ba;B function were, at least in part, differentially regulated by the two classes of cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. It has been suggested that inducible nitric oxide is produced rapidly after LPS stimulation of MPs and inhibits NF&#x003ba;B through the stabilization of I&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. It is possible that cytokines may counteract this effect through modulation of this metabolic junction.</p><p>Cytokine and chemokine effects on MP function are tightly intertwined with the enzymatic activities of MMP. Membrane-bound cytokine receptors and adhesion molecules can be released from the cell surface by MMPs acting as 'sheddases' or 'convertases'. This, in turn, can downregulate cell-surface signaling by removal of receptors, or induce paracrine activity by release of soluble proteins. Not surprisingly, IL-13 overexpression results in production of several MMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. For instance, MMP-9 activates latent TNF-&#x003b1; on the surface of MPs or soluble VEGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Furthermore, Yu and Stamenkovic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] observed that gelatinase B/MMP9 bound to CD44 activates latent TGF-&#x003b2; stored in the pericellular matrix. MMP-7 can enhance tissue repair by facilitating migration of epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In agreement with these reports we observed that the transcription of MMP-7, MMP-9 and CD44 are coordinately induced (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) by the alternative activation of MPs. Conversely, the downregulation of MMP-7 and MMP-9 by the classical cytokines confirms their inhibitory effects on MMP expression. Inhibition of MMP-9 production by IFN-&#x003b2; and IFN-&#x003b3; has been recently reported by Sanceau <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], who noted that interferons regulate MMP expression through IRF/NF&#x003ba;B interaction. Binding of NF&#x003ba;B p50/p65 to the MMP-9 promoter is competitively inhibited by IFN-&#x003b2; and IFN-&#x003b3;-induced IRF-1. Possibly, NF&#x003ba;B regulation of MMP promoters through release of p50 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) was responsible for the transcriptional activation of MMP expression by alternative cytokines observed in this study (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). These observations confirm the tight specificity of the relationship between cytokine and MMP regulation, which is finely toned at several check points and strongly polarized, in these experimental conditions, toward an M2 phenotype.</p><p>Enhanced transcription of gap junction/connexin 26 by the alternative cytokines is also of particular interest in view of the hypothesized junctional communications among MPs or between MPs and endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The finding that MPs activated by alternative cytokines induce the transcription of genes for gap junction components is of physiological importance and may be the missing link in the identification of factors that regulate the expression of gap junction connexins in MPs. In addition, it opens up the possibility that in a milieu dominated by alternative cytokines, where the ultimate goal is to return to homeostasis, the induction of gap junctions increases the ability to transmit or receive regulatory signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] that could facilitate the return to normal housekeeping functions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The early-phase transcriptional profile presented in this study may not comprehensively parallel the plethora of biological effects that a given cytokine can induce under <italic>in vitro </italic>or, most importantly, <italic>in vivo </italic>conditions. Secondary, autocrine and paracrine modulation through the cytokine network following a primary stimulation may introduce novel on and off switches that could override the original signal. Nevertheless, this analysis is directly informative on the primary effect of individual cytokines on the early stages of LPS stimulation and, therefore, may be most informative on the way MP maturation may be polarized at the early stages of the immune response. The clustering of most cytokines into two main groups suggests that their control of central switches (NF&#x003ba;B), or regulatory molecules (cytokines, MMPs, gap junctions, cytotoxic molecules, migratory markers) is essentially bimodal. This polarization program turns MPs to a 'cytotoxic' or a 'symbiotic' phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In physiologic conditions, this dualism is probably modulated by a multiplicity of factors: the extent and duration of the environmental insult and the conditions of the resulting microenvironment. Possibly, predominant and persistent stimulation by pathogen components (such as LPS) may polarize MP towards the cytotoxic phenotype. A predominantly regulatory response is then mounted by the host, mediated by alternative cytokines that would take over at a later stage to induce a symbiotic phenotype aimed at resuming homeostasis upon pathogen clearance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>MP separation and FACS staining</title><p>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from an HLA-A*0201-positive healthy caucasian male donor age 35 were collected at the Department of Transfusion Medicine, NIH.

CD14<sup>+ </sup>MPs were stimulated in parallel with LPS and exposed after 1 h to 42 individual cytokines (see Table 1 for cytokines used). Antisense RNA obtained 4 and 9 h following LPS stimulation was hybridized to custom-made 17K cDNA arrays. Unsupervised Eisen clustering [12] was applied to the complete, unfiltered dataset of 98 experiments. Arrowheads represent control samples that did not receive any stimulation and were obtained at different time points to parallel culture conditions during stimulation (0, 4 and 9 h). Light blue and gold represent samples obtained 4 and 9 h after stimulation, respectively and black represents no stimulation. A375 is a melanoma cell line that was used for quality control alternating conventional (Cy5, red) or reciprocal (Cy3, green) labeling every 25 experiments as previously described [9]. Experiments cluster closer together according to time rather than type of stimulation, with samples obtained after 4 h clustering together (4') with the exception of few cytokines (4"). With few exceptions (9"), cytokine treatments at 9 h clustered together with non-stimulated MPs (9').</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gb-2005-6-2-r15-1"/></fig><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Definition of cytokine classes based on their modulatory effect on the response of CD14+ circulating MP to LPS. <bold>(a) </bold>Definition of cytokine classes based on their modulatory effect on the response of CD14<sup>+ </sup>circulating MPs to LPS. CD14<sup>+ </sup>MPs were stimulated with LPS and exposed after 1 h to 42 individual cytokine stimulations. The clusterogram represents 2,057 genes obtained by Eisen hierarchical clustering of the complete 17K dataset filtered for genes that are expressed in a minimum of 80% of the samples 4 h after LPS stimulation, and that, at least in one experiment, displayed a greater than threefold change in expression over stimulation with LPS alone. Two main classes of cytokines are distinguished: the blue bar indicates type II cytokines (for example, IL-4 and IL-13) and the red bar indicates type I cytokines (such as IFN-&#x003b3;, CD40L and FLT-3L).
