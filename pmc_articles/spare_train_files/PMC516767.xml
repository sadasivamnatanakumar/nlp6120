Columns, floral pedicels of newly open flowers and growing flower stems were observed to have an endopolyploid 8C peak in addition to 2C and 4C peaks. In developing floral pedicels, four peaks were observed for 2C, 4C, 8C and 16C. In root tips, there were 2C, 4C and 8C peaks. But in the root tissues at the region with root hairs, only a 2C peak was observed. Nuclei extracted from young leaves shown three peaks for 2C, 4C and 8C. A similar pattern was found in the vegetative tissues of both greenhouse-grown plants and tissue-cultured plantlets. In mature leaves, a different pattern of ploidy level was found at different parts of the leaves. In the leaf tips and middle parts, there were 2C and 4C peaks.

When mitotic DNA replication in somatic cells is not followed by cell division (a process called endoreduplication), variation of cellular ploidy levels (designated as somatic polyploidy or endopolyploidy) can result [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Endopolyploidy is considered to be developmentally regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and has been described in several plant species including maize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], sunflower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], tomato [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and brassicas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Presence of endopolyploidy as a result of endoreduplication is also a common feature of insects and mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>In orchids, endoreduplication has been described in the raphid crystal idioblasts of <italic>Vanilla </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and in parenchyma cells of <italic>Vanda </italic>seedlings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The family Orchidaceae has an estimated 17,000 to 35,000 species, making it the largest and an important family of the flowering plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Many of the members of the orchid family are commercially valuable, and are micropropagated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The explant sources used for orchid micropropagation include inflorescence, leaves, floral buds and roots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, very little is known about the ploidy variation in different explant tissues of the orchid plants during different developmental periods and at the stage when they are used as explants for micropropagation. Increased knowledge of the degree of endopolyploidy in the explant tissue source will be highly valuable for the maintenance of the original ploidy level in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In this paper, systemic variation of cellular ploidy and DNA content in different tissues of <italic>Spathoglottis plicata</italic>, a common tropical terrestrial orchid species, from field-grown plants and <italic>in vitro </italic>cultures was investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Ploidy level of nuclei isolated from leaves and roots of greenhouse-grown plants</title><p>Flow cytometry analysis of nuclear preparations from entire young leaves of 1&#x02013;3 cm in length revealed that there were three peaks of fluorescence corresponding to 2C, 4C and 8C DNA content of somatic cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).

Tissues taken from different regions of the mature leaves showed that the pattern of ploidy levels was different at different regions. For tissues taken from the basal (petiolar end) of the leaves, there were three fluorescence peaks corresponding to 2C, 4C and 8C nuclear DNA content (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). However, no 8C peak was observed from nuclei preparations taken from tissues of the middle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) and tip (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>) regions of the same leaf; only 2C (35&#x02013;40% of cell populations) and 4C (60&#x02013;65% of cell population) nuclei were identified (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C,1D,1G</xref>).</p><p>In the young root tips, 2C, 4C and 8C peaks were observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>) and the distribution skewed toward 2C population, which accounted for more than 60% of the nuclei population analyzed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>). The percentage of nuclei population with 4C and 8C DNA content in the root tip was relatively small and accounted for only about 10% each (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E,1G</xref>).

In pedicels of un-open flower (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>), there was a 16C peak in addition to 2C, 4C and 8C peaks. The majority of nuclei were in 4C (28%) and 8C (46%) peaks. The 2C and 16C peaks each had less than 10% of the total nuclei (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H</xref>).

For angiosperms, information on 'C' values is used in a wide range of biological fields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The 1C DNA values in angiosperm plants differ approximately 1000 folds, ranging from 0.13 pg in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>to 127.4 pg in <italic>Fritillaria assyriaca </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The DNA content per genome is usually considered to be constant between cells in an individual, and relatively constant between individuals of the same species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, in some plant species, intraplant ploidy variations were reported, and this implied that the nuclear DNA content in these species is not static and hence a great amount of variation occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. For example, a survey of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>revealed endopolyploidy in hair trichomes, leaf epidermal cells, root tip cells, and cells in the hypocotyls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], but not in the inflorescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In some cell types, the extent of endoreduplication appears to be intrinsically controlled by the differentiation programme, but environmental influences such as light can also affect endoreduplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The patterns of endopolyploidy may be affected by plant growth conditions in some plants. For example, leaves of <italic>in vitro </italic>grown tomato and potato plants were found to have lower level of endopolyploidy than leaves of plants grown in the greenhouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, in <italic>S. plicata</italic>, patterns of endopolyploidy were found to be similar in both tissue-cultured plants and greenhouse-grown plants. Endoreduplication was found to occur in actively growing tissues with of <italic>S. plicata </italic>such as young leaves (1&#x02013;3 cm in length, newly initiated) and root tips from greenhouse-grown plants. Similarly, endopolyploid cells were found in protocorms, young leaves and root tips from <italic>S. plicata </italic>seedlings in tissue culture. The common feature for protocorms, young leaves of 1&#x02013;3 cm and root tips are that they are young and active in cell division and growth. In other orchids such as <italic>Dendrobium</italic>, endopolyploidy was found in root tips and newly expanded young leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In the root segment with root hairs of <italic>S. plicata</italic>, endopolyploidy was neither found in tissue-cultured plants nor it was detected in greenhouse-grown plants. These results imply that the presence of the endopolyploidy during <italic>S. plicata </italic>development is an intrinsic programme, and it is not much affected by the growth condition.</p><p>Besides root tips and newly developing young leaves, endopolyploidy was observed in mature leaves in a few <italic>Dendrobium </italic>species and cultivars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Endopolyploidy was also detected in mature leaves of <italic>S. plicata. </italic>Furthermore, when the tip, middle and basal parts of the mature leaf were examined, different patterns of ploidy levels were obtained. Endopolyploidy was found only in leaf base part of mature leaves. A mature leaf represents a continuous developmental system, with the young, less green meristem cells at the basal petiolar end and the older, photosynthetically active cells at the tip [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Previous research shown that in cucumber and succulent plants with small genome, the level of endoreduplication does not increase once an organ is fully developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The tips and middle parts of mature leaves in <italic>S. plicata </italic>are fully developed. Endoreduplication in these tissues is unlikely since it would lead to further cell expansion. The pattern of DNA ploidy variation within the mature leaf is closely associated with the developmental status. The mechanism that resulted in endopolyploidy, however, remains unclear.</p><p>In <italic>S. plicata</italic>, endopolyploidy was present in some floral tissues such as columns, growing flower stems and pedicels of both un-open and freshly open flowers. However, other floral tissues like sepals, petals and ovary tissues were found to have only 2C nuclei. In the growing un-open flower pedicels, the highest ploidy level even reached 16C. In cabbage, endopolyploidy was reported in cabbage flowers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and detailed patterns of endopolyploidy were found in various developmental stages of petals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In cabbage petals, differentiation of expanding cells was characterized by endoreduplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In the proximal part of the cabbage petal, differentiation was accompanied with endoreduplication and cell enlargement. By contrast, no endopolyploid nucleus was found in the distal part of the lamina in the mature cabbage petal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This study suggested that the developmental program of the cabbage petals might induce the initiation of endoreduplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, endopolyploidy was found in hypocotyls, cotyledonary leaves, rosette leaves, stems of bolting plants and floral leaves, but was not found in inflorescences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Given the small size of columns within <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>floral buds, and the small population of endopolyploid nuclei found in columns and pedicels of <italic>S. plicata </italic>in this study, the minute population of the endopolyploid nuclei could easily be neglected when the whole floral buds were used for sampling. In <italic>S. plicata</italic>, it was found that the average size of nuclei was larger in columns and pedicels that have a measurable amount of endopolyploid cells than in other flora tissues without endopolyploidy (unpublished results). Similarly, a correlation was found between cell size and ploidy levels during cabbage petal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In <italic>Dendrobium</italic>, the post-pollination physiological changes were found to be different between floral tissues such as columns, ovary tissues, sepals and petals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Edgar and Orr-Weaver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] suggested that as endoreduplication is often found in large cells or cells with high metabolic activity, it might be a common strategy for cell growth without division.</p><p>Further evidence was found in legumes where cell differentiation to a specialized function as pod wall tissues was accompanied by endoreduplication, and higher ploidy levels coincided with maximum pod growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. During tomato fruit development, the pericarp tissue of young green fruit did not have higher ploidy (usually within 2C and 4C), but most of the cells in pericarp became endopolyploid (up to 256C) as the fruit developed further [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In tobacco single cell culture, endoreduplication was associated with plant growth regulators. When auxin was applied alone, endoreduplication was induced and the DNA content kept pace with the increment of cell volume. When both auxin and cytokinin were supplied subsequently, the cells divided first as amitosis leading to DNA endoreduplication, then followed by normal mitosis cell cycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Gibberellin and ethylene were found to play important roles in the endoreduplication of <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>hypocotyls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In cabbage, mammals, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>and some small genome plants like <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, it is thought that endoreduplication is developmentally regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>The systemic endopolyploidy revealed within different tissues of <italic>S. plicata </italic>raises the question of its possible implications. In tobacco, it was reported that the morphogenetic response of the tissues culture was related to the nuclear DNA content variation within stem explants of different ages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In <italic>Oncidium </italic>Gower Ramsey, a hybrid orchid, only root tips, cut surfaces of stem segments and young leaves were able to form callus in tissue culture. Other explants such as old leaves and the roots without meristem tips could not form any callus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Molecular data showed that the nuclear DNA modulation was closely related to the acquisition of embryogenic competence in cultured carrot hypocotyls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In various tissues in cabbage plants, the number of endocycles was tissue-specific and was characteristic of the developmental stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. These studies suggested that pattern of endopolyploidy may represent the characteristic of the developmental and physiological properties of the tissue.</p><p>The role of endoreduplication in plant development is still not well understood. The presence of endopolyploidy was proposed to be associated with several factors, such as taxonomic position of a species, life cycle, genome size, and organ type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Recent investigation of 16 plant species suggested that endopolyploidization might provide a mechanism to facilitate plant growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Endoreduplication benefits fast growth in several ways. In polyploid cells, the increased gene dosages may enhance the transcriptional and metabolic activities. In addition, several processes are eliminated in the endoreduplication cycle such as the reorganization of the cytoskeleton and condensation of the chromosomes, and that might allow faster growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Ploidy level also plays a role in controlling the size of the cells, the organs or the whole plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. One of the common features of plant development is the uneven enlargement of plant cells coupled to somatic endoreduplication, which indicates that the enlargement of plant cells might be the consequence of the increased genome size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>This research may also have an impact on the orchid industry. Orchidaceae is the largest family of the flowering plants, and many of its members are commercially hybridized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Clonal propagation is a common and essential practice for multiplication of hybrid orchids because the genotypes of the hybrids are usually heterozygous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Many tissues have been used as explants for micropropagation including inflorescence, leaves, floral buds and roots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Somaclonal variation is undesirable, and it is a major problem encountered in commercial micropropagation of orchids if true-to-type plants are required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The mechanism of the somaclonal variation is poorly understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Polyploidy is considered as a possible cause for somaclonal variation in tissue cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], but how polyploidy is generated during tissue culture is unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The presence of systemic endopolyploidy and DNA content variation within different tissues of <italic>S. plicata </italic>as revealed in this study suggests that endopolyploidy and DNA content variation in explants might be a cause for somaclonal variation in tissue culture derived orchid plantlets. Thus, the pre-knowledge about the ploidy variation in different explant tissues is valuable for clonal propagation or for deliberate induction of variants in culture. Further systemic investigation of the relationship between somaclonal variation and type and endopolyploid level of source explants will provide indepth knowledge for micropropagation of orchids.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Systemic variation of cellular endopolyploidy in different tissues during growth and development of <italic>Spathoglottis plicata </italic>from field-grown plants and <italic>in vitro </italic>cultures was developmentally regulated. Pattern of endopolyploidy is a character of the developmental and physiological properties of the tissue. This finding provides useful information for understanding of the plant development and for industrial propagation of orchids.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials</title><p><italic>Spathoglottis plicata </italic>L. is a common tropical terrestrial orchid. The plants were grown in pots and placed in the greenhouse at 28 &#x000b1; 4&#x000b0;C without artificial lighting.
