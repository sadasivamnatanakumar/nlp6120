No effective treatment is available and the genome sequence has recently been completed. This parasite differs from other apicomplexans in its lack of a plastid organelle, the apicoplast. Gene transfer, either intracellular from an endosymbiont/donor organelle or horizontal from another organism, can provide evidence of a previous endosymbiotic relationship and/or alter the genetic repertoire of the host organism.

As an emerging pathogen in humans and other animals, <italic>Cryptosporidium </italic>often causes fever, diarrhea, anorexia and other complications. Although cryptosporidial infection is often self-limiting, it can be persistent and fatal for immunocompromised individuals. So far, no effective treatment is available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Furthermore, because of its resistance to standard chlorine disinfection of water, <italic>Cryptosporidium </italic>continues to be a security concern as a potential water-borne bioterrorism agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p><italic>Cryptosporidium </italic>is phylogenetically quite distant from the hemosporidian and coccidian apicomplexans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and, depending on the molecule and method used, is either basal to all Apicomplexa examined thus far, or is the sister group to the gregarines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It is unusual in several respects, notably for the lack of the apicoplast organelle which is characteristic of all other apicomplexans that have been examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The apicoplast is a relict plastid hypothesized to have been acquired by an ancient secondary endosymbiosis of a pre-alveolate eukaryotic cell with an algal cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. All that remains of the endosymbiont in Coccidia and Haemosporidia is a plastid organelle surrounded by four membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The apicoplast retains its own genome, but this is much reduced (27-35 kilobases (kb)), and contains genes primarily involved in the replication of the plastid genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In apicomplexans that have a plastid, many of the original plastid genes appear to have been lost (for example, photosynthesis genes) and some genes have been transferred to the host nuclear genome; their proteins are reimported into the apicoplast where they function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Plastids acquired by secondary endosymbiosis are scattered among eukaryotic lineages, including cryptomonads, haptophytes, alveolates, euglenids and chlorarachnions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Among the alveolates, plastids are found in dinoflagellates and most examined apicomplexans but not in ciliates. Recent studies on the nuclear-encoded, plastid-targeted glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene suggest a common origin of the secondary plastids in apicomplexans, some dinoflagellates, heterokonts, haptophytes and cryptomonads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. If true, this would indicate that the lineage that gave rise to <italic>Cryptosporidium </italic>contained a plastid, even though many of its descendants (for example, the ciliates) appear to lack a plastid. Although indirect evidence has been noted for the past existence of an apicoplast in <italic>C. parvum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], no rigorous phylogenomic survey for nuclear-encoded genes of plastid or algal origin has been reported.</p><p>Gene transfers, either intracellular (IGT) from an endosymbiont or organelle to the host nucleus or horizontal (HGT) between species, can dramatically alter the biochemical repertoire of host organisms and potentially create structural or functional novelties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In parasites, genes transferred from prokaryotes or other sources are potential targets for chemotherapy due to their phylogenetic distance or lack of a homolog in the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The detection of transferred genes in <italic>Cryptosporidium </italic>is thus of evolutionary and practical importance.</p><p>In this study, we use a phylogenomic approach to mine the recently sequenced genome of <italic>C. parvum </italic>(IOWA isolate; 9.1 megabases (Mb)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] for evidence of the past existence of an endosymbiont or apicoplast organelle and of other independent HGTs into this genome. We have detected genes of cyanobacterial/algal origin and genes acquired from other prokaryotic lineages in <italic>C. parvum</italic>. The fate of several of these transferred genes in <italic>C. parvum </italic>is explored by expression analyses. The significance of our findings and their impact on the genetic makeup of the parasite are discussed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>BLAST analyses</title><p>From BLAST analyses, the genome of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>, like that of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], is more similar overall to those of the plants <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>and <italic>Oryza </italic>than to any other non-apicomplexan organism currently represented in GenBank. The program Glimmer predicted 5,519 protein-coding sequences in the <italic>C. parvum </italic>genome, 4,320 of which had similarity to other sequences deposited in the GenBank nonredundant protein database. A significant number of these sequences, 936 (E-value &#x0003c; 10<sup>-3</sup>) or 783 (E-value &#x0003c; 10<sup>-7</sup>), had their most significant, non-apicomplexan, similarity to a sequence isolated from plants, algae, eubacteria (including cyanobacteria) or archaea (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). To evaluate these observations further, phylogenetic analyses were performed, when possible, for each predicted protein in the entire genome.</p></sec><sec><title>Phylogenomic analyses</title><p>The Glimmer-predicted protein-coding regions of the <italic>C. parvum </italic>genome (5,519 sequences) were used as input for phylogenetic analyses using the PyPhy program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In this program, phylogenetic trees for each input sequence are analyzed to determine the taxonomic identity of the nearest neighbor relative to the input sequence at a variety of taxonomic levels, for example, genus, family, or phylum. Using stringent analysis criteria (see Materials and methods), 954 trees were constructed from the input set of 5,519 predicted protein sequences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Analysis of the nearest non-apicomplexan neighbor on the 954 trees revealed the following nearest neighbor relationships: eubacterial (115 trees), archaeal (30), green plant/algal (204), red algal (8), and glaucocystophyte (4); other alveolate (61) and other eukaryotes made up the remainder. As some input sequences may have more than one nearest neighbor of interest on a tree, a nonredundant total of 393 sequences were identified with nearest neighbors to the above lineages.</p><p>Searches of the <italic>C. parvum </italic>predicted gene set with the 551 <italic>P. falciparum </italic>predicted nuclear-encoded apicoplast-targeted proteins (NEAPs) yielded 40 significant hits (E-value &#x0003c; 10<sup>-5</sup>), 23 of which were also identified in the phylogenomic analyses. A combination of these two approaches identified 410 candidates requiring further detailed analyses. Of these candidates, the majority were eliminated after stringent criteria were applied because of ambiguous tree topologies, insufficient taxonomic sampling, lack of bootstrap support or the presence of clear vertical eukaryotic ancestry (see Materials and methods). Thirty-one genes survived the screen and were deemed to be either strong or likely candidates for gene transfer (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p><p>Of the 31 recovered genes, several have been previously published or submitted to the GenBank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], including those identified as having plant or eubacterial 'likeness' on the basis of similarity searches when the genome sequence was published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The remaining sequences were further tested to rule out the possibility that they were artifacts (<italic>C. parvum </italic>oocysts are purified from cow feces which contain plant and bacterial matter). Two experiments were performed. In the first, nearly complete genomic sequences (generated in a different laboratory) from the closely related species <italic>C. hominis </italic>were screened using BLASTN for the existence of the predicted genes. Twenty out of 21 <italic>C. parvum </italic>sequences were identified in <italic>C. hominis</italic>. The remaining sequence was represented by two independently isolated expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences in the GenBank and CryptoDB databases (data not shown). In the second experiment, genomic Southern analyses of the IOWA isolate were carried out (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) for several of the genes of bacterial or plant origin. In each case, a band of the predicted size was identified (see Additional data file 1). The genes are not contaminants.</p></sec><sec><title>Genes of cyanobacterial/algal origin</title><p>Extant <italic>Cryptosporidium </italic>species do not contain an apicoplast genome or any physical structure thought to represent an algal endosymbiont or the plastid organelle it contained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The only possible remaining evidence of the past association of an endosymbiont or its cyanobacterially derived plastid organelle might be genes transferred from these genetic sources to the host genome prior to the physical loss of the endosymbiont or organelle itself. Several such genes were identified.</p><p>A leucine aminopeptidase gene of cyanobacterial origin was found in the <italic>C. parvum </italic>nuclear genome. This gene is also present in the nuclear genome of other apicomplexan species (<italic>Plasmodium</italic>, <italic>Toxoplasma </italic>and <italic>Eimeria</italic>), as confirmed by similarity searches against ApiDB (see Materials and methods). In <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, leucine aminopeptidase is a predicted NEAP and possesses an amino-terminal extension with a putative transit peptide. Consistent with the lack of an apicoplast, this gene in <italic>Cryptosporidium </italic>contains no evidence of a signal peptide and the amino-terminal extension is reduced. Similarity searches of the GenBank nonredundant protein database revealed top hits to <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, followed by <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, and several cyanobacteria including <italic>Prochlorococcus</italic>, <italic>Nostoc </italic>and <italic>Trichodesmium</italic>, and plant chloroplast precursors in <italic>Lycopersicon esculentum </italic>and <italic>Solanum tuberosum </italic>(data not shown). A multiple sequence alignment of the predicted protein sequences of leucine aminopeptidase reveals overall similarity and a shared indel among apicomplexan, plant and cyanobacterial sequences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Phylogenetic analyses strongly support a monophyletic grouping of <italic>C. parvum </italic>and other apicomplexan leucine aminopeptidase proteins with cyanobacteria and plant chloroplast precursors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). So far, this gene has not been detected in ciliates.</p><p>Another <italic>C. parvum </italic>nuclear-encoded gene of putative cyanobacterial origin is a protein of unknown function belonging to the biopterine transporter family (BT-1) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Similarity searches with this protein revealed significant hits to other apicomplexans (for example, <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, <italic>Theileria annulata</italic>, <italic>T. gondii</italic>), plants (<italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, <italic>Oryza</italic>), cyanobacteria (<italic>Trichodesmium</italic>, <italic>Nostoc </italic>and <italic>Synechocystis</italic>), a ciliate (<italic>Tetrahymena</italic>) and the kinetoplastids (<italic>Leishmania </italic>and <italic>Trypanosoma</italic>). <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>apparently contains at least two copies of this gene; the protein of one (accession number NP_565734) is predicted by ChloroP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] to be chloroplast-targeted, suggestive of its plastid derivation. The taxonomic distribution and sequence similarity of this protein with cyanobacterial and chloroplast homologs are also indicative of its affinity to plastids.</p><p>Only one gene of algal nuclear origin, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (G6PI), was identified by the screen described here. Several other algal-like genes are probable, but their support was weaker (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). A 'plant-like' G6PI has been described in other apicomplexan species (<italic>P. falciparum</italic>, <italic>T. gondii </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]) and a 'cyanobacterial-like' G6PI has been described in the diplomonads <italic>Giardia intestinalis </italic>and <italic>Spironucleus </italic>and the parabasalid <italic>Trichomonas vaginalis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref> illustrates these observations nicely. At the base of the tree, the eukaryotic organisms <italic>Giardia</italic>, <italic>Spironucleus </italic>and <italic>Trichomonas </italic>group with the cyanobacterium <italic>Nostoc</italic>, as previously published. In the midsection of the tree, the G6PI of apicomplexans and ciliates forms a well-supported monophyletic group with the plants and the heterokont <italic>Phytophthora</italic>. The multiple protein sequence alignment of G6PI identifies several conserved positions shared exclusively by apicomplexans, <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, plants and <italic>Phytophthora</italic>. This gene does not contain a signal or transit peptide and is not predicted to be targeted to the apicoplast in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. The remainder of the tree shows a weakly supported branch including eubacteria, fungi and several eukaryotes. The eukaryotes are interrupted by the inclusion of G6PI from the eubacterial organisms <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>and <italic>Cytophaga</italic>. This relationship of <italic>E. coli </italic>G6PI and eukaryotic G6PI has been observed before and may represent yet another gene transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Genes of eubacterial (non-cyanobacterial) origin</title><p>Our study identified HGTs from several distinct sources, involving a variety of biochemical activities and metabolic pathways (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Notably, the nucleotide biosynthesis pathway contains at least two previously published, independently transferred genes from eubacteria. Inosine 5' monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), an enzyme for purine salvage, was transferred from &#x003b5;-proteobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Another enzyme involved in pyrimidine salvage, thymidine kinase (TK), is of &#x003b1; or &#x003b3;-proteobacterial ancestry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Another gene of eubacterial origin identified in <italic>C. parvum </italic>is tryptophan synthetase &#x003b2; subunit (<italic>trpB</italic>). This gene has been identified in both <italic>C. parvum </italic>and <italic>C. hominis</italic>, but not in other apicomplexans. The relationship of <italic>C. parvum trpB </italic>to proteobacterial sequences is well-supported as a monophyletic group by two of the three methods used in our analyses (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>).</p><p>Other HGTs of eubacterial origin include the genes encoding &#x003b1;-amylase and glutamine synthetase and two copies of 1,4-&#x003b1;-glucan branching enzyme, all of which are overwhelmingly similar to eubacterial sequences. &#x003b1;-amylase shows no significant hit to any other apicomplexan or eukaryotic sequence, suggesting a unique HGT from eubacteria to <italic>C. parvum</italic>. Glutamine synthetase is a eubacterial gene found in <italic>C. parvum </italic>and all apicomplexans examined. The eubacterial affinity of the apicomplexan glutamine synthetase is also demonstrated by a well supported (80% with maximum parsimony) monophyletic grouping with eubacterial homologs (data not shown). The eubacterial origin of 1,4-&#x003b1;-glucan branching enzyme is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. Each copy of the gene is found in a strongly supported monophyletic group of sequences derived only from prokaryotes (including cyanobacteria) and one other apicomplexan organism, <italic>T. gondii</italic>. It is possible that these genes are of plastidic origin and were transferred to the nuclear genome before the divergence of <italic>C. parvum </italic>and <italic>T. gondii</italic>; the phylogenetic analysis provides little direct support for this interpretation, however.</p></sec><sec><title>Mode of acquisition</title><p>We examined the transferred genes for evidence of non-independent acquisition, for example, blocks of transferred genes or evidence that genes were acquired together from the same source. Examination of the chromosomal location of the genes listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> demonstrates that the genes are currently located on different chromosomes and in most cases do not appear to have been transferred or retained in large blocks. There are two exceptions. The <italic>trpB </italic>gene and the gene for aspartate ammonia ligase are located 4,881 base-pairs (bp) apart on the same strand of a contig for chromosome V; there is no annotated gene between these two genes. Both genes are of eubacterial origin and are not found in other apicomplexan organisms. While it is possible that they have been acquired independently with this positioning, or later came to have this positioning via genome rearrangements, it is interesting to speculate that these genes were acquired together. The origin of <italic>trpB </italic>is proteobacterial. The origin of aspartate ammonia ligase is eubacterial, but not definitively of any particular lineage. In the absence of genome sequences for all organisms, throughout all of time, exact donors are extremely difficult to assess and inferences must be drawn from sequences that appear to be closely related to the actual donor.</p><p>In the second case, <italic>C. parvum </italic>encodes two genes for 1,4-&#x003b1;-glucan branching enzymes. Both are eubacterial in origin and both are located on chromosome VI, although not close together. They are approximately 110 kb apart and many intervening genes are present. The evidence that these genes were acquired together comes from the phylogenetic analysis presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. The duplication that gave rise to the two 1,4-&#x003b1;-glucan branching enzymes is old, and is well supported by the tree shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>. A number of eubacteria (11), including cyanobacteria, contain this duplication. The 1,4-&#x003b1;-glucan branching enzymes of <italic>C. parvum </italic>and <italic>T. gondii </italic>represent one copy each of this ancient duplication. This suggests that the ancestor of <italic>C. parvum </italic>and <italic>T. gondii </italic>acquired the genes after they had duplicated and diverged in eubacteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of transferred genes</title><p>Each of the genes identified in the above analyses (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) appears to be an intact non-pseudogene, suggesting that these genes are functional. To verify the functional status of several of the transferred genes, semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was carried out to characterize their developmental expression profile. Each of the RNA samples from <italic>C. parvum</italic>-infected HCT-8 cells was shown to be free of contaminating <italic>C. parvum </italic>genomic DNA by the lack of amplification product from a reverse transcriptase reaction sham control. RT-PCR detected no signals in cDNA samples from mock-infected HCT-8 cells. On the other hand, RT-PCR product signals were detected in the <italic>C. parvum</italic>-infected cells of six independent time-course experiments for each of the genes examined (those for G6PI, leucine aminopeptidase, BT-1, a calcium-dependent protein kinase, tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, dihydrofolate reductase- thymidine synthetase (DHFR-TS)). The expression profiles of the acquired genes show that they are regulated and differentially expressed throughout the life cycle of <italic>C. parvum </italic>in patterns characteristic of other non-transferred genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).</p><p>A small published collection of 567 EST sequences for <italic>C. parvum </italic>is also available. These ESTs were searched with each of the 31 candidate genes surviving the phylogenomic screen. Three genes - aspartate ammonia ligase, BT-1 and lactate dehydrogenase - are expressed, as confirmed by the presence of an EST (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>A genome-wide search for intracellular and horizontal gene transfers in <italic>C. parvum </italic>was carried out. We systematically determined the evolutionary origins of genes in the genome using phylogenetic approaches, and further confirmed the existence and expression of putatively transferred genes with laboratory experiments. The methodology adopted in this study provides a broad picture of the extent and the importance of gene transfer in apicomplexan evolution.</p><p>The identification of gene transfers is often subject to errors introduced by methodology, data quality and taxonomic sampling. The phylogenetic approach adopted in this study is preferable to similarity searches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] but several factors, including long-branch attraction, mutational saturation, lineage-specific gene loss and acquisition, and incorrect identification of orthologs, can distort the topology of a gene tree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Incompleteness in the taxonomic record may also lead to false positives for IGT and HGT identification. In our study, we have attempted to alleviate these factors, as best as is possible, by sampling the GenBank nonredundant protein database, dbEST and organism-specific databases and by using several phylogenetic methods. Still, these issues remain a concern for this study as the taxonomic diversity of unicellular eukaryotes is vastly undersampled and studies are almost entirely skewed towards parasitic organisms.</p><p>The published analysis of the <italic>C. parvum </italic>genome sequence identified 14 bacteria-like and 15 plant-like genes based on similarity searches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Six of these bacterial-like and three plant-like genes were also identified as probable transferred genes in the phylogenomic analyses presented here. We have examined the fate of genes identified by one analysis and not the other to uncover the origin of the discrepancy. First, methodology is the single largest contributing factor. Genes with bacterial-like or plant-like BLAST similarities which, from the phylogenetic analyses, do not appear to be transfers were caused by the fact that PyPhy was unable to generate trees due to an insufficient number of significant hits in the database, or because of the stringent coverage length and similarity requirements adopted in this analysis. Only seven of the previously identified 15 plant-like and 11 of 14 eubacterial-like genes survived the predefined criteria for tree construction. Second, subsequent phylogenetic analyses including additional sequences from non-GenBank databases failed to provide sufficient evidence or significant support for either plant or eubacterial ancestry. Third, searches of dbEST and other organism-specific databases yielded other non-plant or non-eubacterial organisms as nearest neighbors, thus removing the possibility of a transfer.</p><p>The limitations of similarity searches and incomplete taxonomic sampling are well evidenced in our phylogenomic analyses. From similarity searches, <italic>C. parvum</italic>, like <italic>P. falciparum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], is more similar to the plants <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>and <italic>Oryza </italic>than to any other single organism. Almost 800 predicted genes have best non-apicomplexan BLAST hits of at least 10<sup>-7 </sup>to plants and eubacteria (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Yet only 31 can be inferred to be transferred genes at this time with the datasets and methodology available (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). In many cases (for example, phosphoglucomutase) the <italic>C. parvum </italic>gene groups phylogenetically with plant and bacterial homologs, but with only modest support. In other cases, such as pyruvate kinase and the bi-functional dehydrogenase enzyme (AdhE), gene trees obtained from automated PyPhy analyses indicate a strong monophyletic grouping of the <italic>C. parvum </italic>gene with plant or eubacterial homologs, but this topology disappears when sequences from other unicellular eukaryotes, such as <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, <italic>Entamoeba </italic>and <italic>Trichomonas </italic>are included in the analysis (data not shown).</p><p>The list of genes in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> should be considered a current best estimate of the IGTs and HGTs in <italic>C. parvum </italic>instead of a definitive list. As genomic data are obtained from a greater diversity of unicellular eukaryotes and eubacteria, phylogenetic analyses of nearest neighbors are likely to change.</p><sec><title>Did <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> contain an endosymbiont or plastid organelle?</title><p>The <italic>C. parvum </italic>sequences of cyanobacterial and algal origin reported here had to enter the genome at some point during its evolution. Formal possibilities include vertical inheritance from a plastid-containing chromalveolate ancestor, HGT from the cyanobacterial and algal sources (or from a secondary source such as a plastid-containing apicomplexan), or IGT from an endosymbiont/plastid organelle during evolution, followed by loss of the source. <italic>Cryptosporidium </italic>does not harbor an apicoplast organelle or any trace of a plastid genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]; thus an IGT scenario would necessitate loss of the organelle in <italic>Cryptosporidium </italic>or the lineage giving rise to it. The exact position of <italic>C. parvum </italic>on the tree of life has been debated, with developmental and morphological considerations placing it within the Apicomplexa, and molecular analyses locating it in various positions, both within and outside the Apicomplexa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], but primarily within. If we assume that <italic>C. parvum </italic>is an apicomplexan, and if the secondary endosymbiosis which is believed to have given rise to the apicoplast occurred before the formation of the Apicomplexa, as has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], <italic>C. parvum </italic>would have evolved from a plastid-containing lineage and would be expected to harbor traces of this relationship in its nuclear genome. Genes of likely cyanobacterial and algal/plant origin are detected in the nuclear genome of <italic>C. parvum </italic>(Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>) and thus IGT followed by organelle loss cannot be ruled out.</p><p>What about other interpretations? While it is formally possible that these genes were acquired independently via HGT in <italic>C. parvum</italic>, their shared presence in other alveolates (including the non-plastidic ciliate <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>) provides the best evidence against this scenario as multiple independent transfers would be required and so far there is no evidence for intra-alveolate gene transfer. Vertical inheritance is more difficult to address as it involves distinguishing between genes acquired via IGT from a primary endosymbiotic event versus a secondary endosymbioic event. Our data, especially the analysis of G6PI and BT-1 are consistent with both primary and secondary endosymbioses, provided that the secondary endosymbiosis is pre-alveolate in origin. As more genome data become available and flanking genes can be examined for each gene in a larger context, positional information will be informative in distinguishing among the alternatives.</p><p>The plastidic nature of some genes is particularly apparent. There is a shared indel among leucine aminopeptidase protein sequences in apicomplexans, cyanobacteria and plant chloroplast precursors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The <italic>C. parvum </italic>leucine aminopeptidase does contain an amino-terminal extension of approximately 85-65 amino acids (depending on the alignment) relative to bacterial homologs, but this extension does not contain a signal sequence. The extension in <italic>P. falciparum </italic>is 85 amino acids and the protein is believed to be targeted to the apicoplast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. No similarity is detected between the <italic>C. parvum </italic>and <italic>P. falciparum </italic>amino-terminal extensions (data not shown).</p><p>Other genes were less informative in this analysis. Among these, aldolase was reported in both <italic>P. falciparum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and the kinetoplastid parasite <italic>Trypanosoma </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] as a plant-like gene. The protein sequences of aldolase are similar in <italic>C. parvum </italic>and <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, with an identity of 60%. In our phylogenetic analyses, <italic>C. parvum </italic>clearly forms a monophyletic group with <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, <italic>Toxoplasma </italic>and <italic>Eimeria</italic>. This branch groups with <italic>Dictyostelium</italic>, Kinetoplastida and cyanobacterial lineages, but bootstrap support is not significant. The sister group to the above organisms are the plants and additional cyanobacteria, but again with no bootstrap support (see Additional data file 1 for phylogenetic tree). Another gene, enolase, contains two indels shared between land plants and apicomplexans (including <italic>C. parvum</italic>) and was suggested to be a plant-like gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], but alternative explanations exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>The biochemical activity of the polyamine biosynthetic enzyme arginine decarboxylase (ADC), which is typically found in plants and bacteria, was previously reported in <italic>C. parvum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, we were unable to confirm its presence by similarity searches of the two <italic>Cryptosporidium </italic>genome sequences deposited in CryptoDB using plant (<italic>Cucumis sativa</italic>, GenBank accession number AAP36992), cyanobacterial (<italic>Nostoc </italic>sp., NP-487441; <italic>Synechocystis </italic>sp., NP-439907) and other bacterial (<italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>, NP-404547) homologs.</p></sec><sec><title>A plethora of prokaryotic genes</title><p>Several HGTs from bacteria have been reported previously in <italic>C. parvum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. We detected many more in our screen of the completed <italic>C. parvum </italic>genome sequence (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). In most cases, the exact donors of these transferred genes were difficult to determine. However, for those genes whose donors could be more reliably inferred (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), several appear to be from different sources and hence represent independent transfer events. In one compelling case, both the <italic>trpB </italic>and aspartate ammonia ligase genes are located 4,881 bp apart on the same strand of a contig for chromosome V and there is no gene separating them. Both genes are of eubacterial origin and neither gene is detected in other apicomplexans. In addition, the aspartate ammonia ligase gene is expressed, as evidenced by an EST. In another case, copies of a 1,4-&#x003b1;-glucan branching enzyme gene duplication pair that is present in many eubacteria, were detected on the same chromosome in <italic>C. parvum</italic>. <italic>C. parvum </italic>also contains many transferred genes from distinct eubacterial sources that are not present in other apicomplexans (for example, IMPDH, TK (thymidine kinase), <italic>trpB </italic>and the gene for aspartate ammonia ligase).</p><p>The endosymbiotic event that gave rise to the mitochondrion occurred very early in eukaryotic evolution and is associated with significant IGT. However, most of these transfer events happened long before the evolutionary time window we explored in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Many IGTs from the mitochondrial genome that have been retained are almost universally present in eukaryotes (including <italic>C. parvum </italic>which does not contain a typical mitochondrion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]) and thus would not be detected in a PyPhy screen since the 'nearest phylogenetic neighbor' on the tree would be taxonomically correct and not appear as a relationship indicative of a gene transfer.</p></sec><sec><title>The impact of gene transfers on host evolution</title><p>Gene transfer is an important evolutionary force [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Several of the transferred genes identified in <italic>C. parvum </italic>are known to be expressed. IMPDH has been shown to be essential in <italic>C. parvum </italic>purine metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and TK has been shown to be functional in pyrimidine salvage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. It is not yet clear whether these genes were acquired independently in this lineage, or have been lost from the rest of the apicomplexan lineage, or whether both these have happened. However, it is clear that their presence has facilitated the remodeling of nucleotide biosynthesis. <italic>C. parvum </italic>no longer possesses the ability to synthesize nucleotides; instead it relies entirely on salvage.</p><p>Many apicoplast and algal nuclear genes have been transferred to the host nuclear genome, where they were subsequently translated in the cytosol and their proteins targeted to the apicoplast organelle. However, as there is no apicoplast in <italic>C. parvum</italic>, acquired plastidic proteins are theoretically destined to go elsewhere. In the absence of an apicoplast, it is tempting to suspect that plastid-targeted proteins would have been lost, or would be detected as pseudogenes. No identifiable pseudogenes were detected and at least one gene is still viable. The <italic>C. parvum </italic>leucine aminopeptidase, which still contains an amino-terminal extension (without a signal peptide), is intact and is expressed, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>. None of the cyanobacterial/algal genes identified in our study contains a canonical presequence for apicoplast targeting. One exception to this is phosphoglucomutase, a gene not present in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> because of its poorly supported relationships in phylogenetic analyses. This gene exists in two copies as a tandem duplication in the <italic>C. parvum </italic>genome. One copy has a long amino-terminal extension (97 amino acids) beginning with a signal peptide. The extension does not contain characteristics of a transit peptide. Expression of a fluorescent reporter construct containing this extension in a related parasite, <italic>T. gondii</italic>, did not reveal apicoplast targeting but instead secretion via dense granules (see Additional data file 1). Exactly how and where intracellularly transferred genes (especially those that normally target the apicoplast) have become incorporated into other metabolic processes remains a fertile area for exploration.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p><italic>Cryptosporidium </italic>is the recipient of a large number (31) of transferred genes, many of which are not shared by other apicomplexan parasites. The genes have been acquired from several different sources including &#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;-, and &#x003b5;-proteobacteria, cyanobacteria, algae/plants and possibly the Archaea. We have described two cases of two genes that appear to have been acquired together from a eubacterial source: <italic>trpB </italic>and the aspartate ammonia ligase gene are located within 5 kb of each other, while the two copies of 1,4-&#x003b1;-glucan branching enzyme represent copies of an ancient gene duplication also observed in cyanobacteria.</p><p>Once thought to be a relatively rare event, reports of gene transfers in eukaryotes are increasingly common. The abundance of available eukaryotic genome sequence is providing the material for analyses that were not possible only a few years ago. Analysis of the <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] has revealed potentially thousands of genes that were transferred intracellularly. HGTs are still a relatively rare class of genes among multicellular eukaryotes, most probably because of the segregation of the germ line. By definition, unicellular eukaryotes do not have a separate germ line and are obligated to tolerate the acquisition of foreign genes if they are to survive. Among unicellular eukaryotes, there are now many reports of HGTs: <italic>Giardia </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], <italic>Trypanosoma </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], <italic>Entamoeba </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], <italic>Euglena </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], <italic>Cryptosporidium </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and other apicomplexans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p><p>As discussed earlier, genes transferred from distant phylogenetic sources such as eubacteria could be potential therapeutic targets.

A few predicted genes that demonstrated apparent sequence incompleteness were reconstructed from genomic sequence by comparison with apicomplexan orthologs. The predicted protein encoding data set contained 5,519 sequences. A comparison of this gene set to the published annotation revealed that the Glimmer-predicted gene set contained all but 40 of the 3,396 annotated protein-encoding sequences deposited in GenBank. These 40 were added to our dataset and analyzed. Glimmer does not predict introns and some introns are present in the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]; thus our gene count is artificially inflated. Likewise, the official <italic>C. parvum </italic>annotation did not consider ORFs of less than 100 amino acids that did not have significant BLAST hits and thus may be a slight underestimate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Database creation</title><p>An internal database (ApiDB) containing all available apicomplexan sequence data was created [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].

Genomic sequences for <italic>T. gondii </italic>(8x coverage) and clustered ESTs were downloaded from ToxoDB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Genomic data were provided by The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR), and by the Sanger Institute. EST sequences were generated by Washington University. In addition, this study used sequence data from several general and species-specific databases. Specifically, the NCBI GenBank nr and dbEST were downloaded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>] and extensively searched. To provide taxonomic completeness, additional genes were obtained via searches of additional databases including: <italic>Entamoeba histolytica </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], <italic>D. discoideum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>], the kinetoplastids <italic>Leishmania major </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>], <italic>T. brucei </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>], <italic>T. cruzi </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>], and a ciliate <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>].

For initial phylogenomic analyses, a BLAST cutoff of 60% sequence length coverage and 50% sequence similarity was adopted and the neighbor-joining program of PAUP 4.0b10 for Unix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>] was used. A detailed description of our phylogenomic pipeline and PyPhy implementation are described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] and outlined in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.</p><p>Output gene trees with phylogenetic connections (that is, the nearest non-self neighbors at a distinct taxonomic rank) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] to prokaryotes and algae-related groups were manually inspected. As the trees are unrooted, several factors were considered in the screen for candidate transferred genes. If the <italic>C. parvum </italic>gene does not form a monophyletic group with prokaryotic or plant-related taxa regardless of rooting, the subject gene was eliminated from further consideration. If the topology of the gene tree is consistent with a phylogenetic anomaly caused by gene transfer, but may also be interpreted differently if the tree is rooted otherwise, it was removed from consideration at this time. If the top hits of both nr and dbEST database searches are predominantly non-plant eukaryotes, and the topology of the tree was poor, the subject gene was considered an unlikely candidate. Finally, all 551 protein sequences predicted to be NEAPs in the malarial parasite <italic>P. falciparum </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] were used to search the <italic>C. parvum </italic>genome and the results were screened using a BLAST cutoff E-value of 10<sup>-5 </sup>and a length coverage of 50%. Sequences identified by these searches were added to the candidate list (if not already present) for manual phylogenetic analyses to verify their likely origins. It should be noted that all trees were screened for the existence of a particular phylogenetic relationship. In some cases the proteins utilized to generate a particular tree are capable of resolving relationships among many branches of the tree of life, and in others they are not. Despite these differences in resolving power, the proteins which survive our phylogenetic screen and subsequent detailed analyses described below exhibit significant support for the branches of the tree in which we are interested. Similar procedures were used to characterize the complement of nuclear-encoded genes of plastid origin in the <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. BLAST searches were performed on GenBank releases 138-140 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].</p><p>Detailed phylogenetic analyses of candidate genes identified by phylogenomic screening: candidate genes surviving the PyPhy phylogenomic screen were reanalyzed with careful attention to taxonomic completeness, including representative species from major prokaryotic and eukaryotic lineages when necessary and possible. New multiple sequence alignments were created with ClustalX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>], followed by manual refinement. Only unambiguously aligned sequence segments were used for subsequent analyses (see Additional data file 1). Phylogenetic analyses were performed with a maximum likelihood method using TREE-PUZZLE version 5.1 for Unix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>], a distance method using the program neighbor of PHYLIP version 3.6a package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>], and a maximum parsimony method with random stepwise addition using PAUP* 4.0b10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. Bootstrap support was estimated using 1,000 replicates for both parsimony and distance analyses and quartet puzzling values were obtained using 10,000 puzzling steps for maximum likelihood analyses. Distance calculation used the Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) substitution matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>], and site-substitution variation was modeled with a gamma-distribution whose shape parameter was estimated from the data. For maximum likelihood analyses, a mixed model of eight gamma-distributed rates and one invariable rate was used to calculate the pairwise maximum likelihood distances. The unrooted trees presented in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> were drawn by supplying TREE-PUZZLE with the maximum parsimony tree and using TREE-PUZZLE distances as described above to calculate the branch lengths.
