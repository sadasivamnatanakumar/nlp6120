Subsequently, an increase of plant resistance against a broad spectrum of pathogens is observed systemically. This plant immunity is known as Systemic Acquired Resistance. To identify components of the transduction pathway, we cloned and analysed the expression pattern of several mRNAs accumulating in cucumber plants after induction of Systemic Acquired Resistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We tested on cucumber different compounds known to induce systemic acquired resistance. Among these, BTH (benzo(1,2,3)thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester) proved to be very effective. mRNA RT-PCR differential display was used to identify mRNA sequences induced 24 hours after the application of 10 &#x003bc;M BTH to cucumber plants. A cDNA library constructed from cucumber plants sprayed with 10 &#x003bc;M BTH was screened to get corresponding full length cDNAs. Among the identified cDNAs were those coding for a putative ras-related GTP-binding protein, a putative beta-1,4-<italic>N</italic>-Acetylglucosaminyltranferase III and a putative pathogenesis related protein. The time course of accumulation of the three corresponding mRNAs was analysed by northern blotting in plants treated by BTH or in plants infected by <italic>Colletotrichum lagenarium</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The mRNA RT-PCR differential display technique allowed the identification of three genes possibly involved in Systemic Acquired Resistance in cucumber. Pathogenesis-related proteins are known to be involved in plant defence against pathogens.

The infected leaves develop a hypersensitive response (HR), i.e., rapid, localized cell death occurring at the sites of pathogen entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Concomitant with the HR is the accumulation of salicylic acid and several classes of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, many of which exhibiting antimicrobial activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Subsequently, an enhancement of the plant defensive capacity against a broad spectrum of pathogens is observed. This resistance is expressed locally as well as in distal, uninfected tissues and can last for several weeks to months. It is known as Systemic Acquired Resistance or SAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Salicylic acid was identified as an important signal in the SAR transduction pathway. It was shown to accumulate during the onset of SAR in cucumber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], tobacco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Exogenously supplied salicylic acid induces the same set of genes and resistance against the same spectrum of pathogens, as with pathogen-induced SAR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Plants in which salicylic acid accumulation is prevented by over expression of a bacterial salicylate hydroxylase gene failed to develop SAR and/or exhibited increased susceptibility to pathogen infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Analysis of <italic>A. thaliana </italic>mutants has revealed that the NPR1 protein (also known as NIM1) is required for SAR induction and acts downstream of salicylic acid in the SAR pathway. Plants carrying mutations in this gene fail to express several <italic>PR </italic>genes and display enhanced susceptibility to infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The NPR1/NIM1 protein interacts with members of the TGA/OBF family of basic leucine zipper transcription factors. Some of these factors have been shown to bind to salicylic acid-responsive promoter elements of the <italic>PR-1 </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The salicylic acid induced interaction of NPR1 with TGA factors is localized in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], while cytoplasmic NPR1 appears to modulate crosstalk between salicylic acid- and jasmonate-dependent defense pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Other components of the salicylic acid signaling pathway have been identified using genetic approaches in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. They include PAD4 and EDS3 which activate EDS4, SID2 and EDS5 leading to salicylic acid accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Besides pathogens, SAR is also induced by exogenously applied chemicals. In addition to salicylic acid, well-known chemical inducers of <italic>PR </italic>genes include 2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid (INA), benzo(1,2,3)thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester (BTH) and L-&#x003b1;-amino butyric acid (ABA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. SAR induction appears to be governed by a complex signal transduction process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] that involves a signal originating at the site of infection or treatment, and moving throughout the plant. Chemical inducers provide tools for dissection of the signal transduction pathway that regulates the defense responses (they enter the pathway at different points). On another hand, the cucumber plant provides a good model system for studying induced disease resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Local and systemic increases in chitinase and/or peroxidase activity have been observed in response to inoculation with necrotizing pathogens or to treatment with SA, INA and BTH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>The aim of the present work was to identify and clone mRNAs accumulating after induction of SAR in cucumber plants. These sequences could correspond to proteins potentially involved in the signal transduction pathway leading to SAR or to proteins responsible for the state of resistance. In a first set of experiments, potential SAR inducing chemicals were tested in order to set up a reproducible system of activation of this resistance in cucumber. The mRNA RT-PCR differential display method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] was then used to identify genes activated during SAR induction. Several differentially expressed cDNA were identified and some of them were cloned and sequenced. Their expression was analyzed by Northern blotting.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Chemically induced resistance in cucumber</title><p>The SAR inducing activity of different chemicals has already been documented in one or several plant species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. To evaluate their activity on cucumber, cotyledons of two-week-old plants were infiltrated with 0.5 mM salicylic acid, 50 mM L-&#x003b1;-amino butyric acid, 0.78 mM 2-thiouracil, 1 mM thiamine or 20 mM BaCl<sub>2</sub>. Control plants were infiltrated with water. In a parallel experiment, four-week-old cucumber plants (with two true leaves) were sprayed with 5 mM salicylic acid, 50 mM L-&#x003b1;-amino butyric acid, 0.78 mM 2-thiouracil, 1 mM thiamine, 20 mM BaCl<sub>2 </sub>or 1 mM BTH. Control plants were sprayed with water or left untreated. Total RNAs were extracted from treated leaves 6 h, 24 h or 48 h after treatment. Induction of <italic>PR-8 </italic>gene was assayed by Northern blotting followed by hybridization with a cucumber PR-8 cDNA probe. <italic>PR-8 </italic>cucumber gene encodes an acidic chitinase which accumulates after tobacco necrosis virus (TNV) infection or salicylic acid induction and is considered as a SAR molecular marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>In infiltration experiments (results not shown), control plants showed positive hybridization signals. To check whether this activation of the <italic>PR-8 </italic>gene could be due to wounding during infiltration, the effect of wounding alone was evaluated by making a cut from the midvein to the outer edge of the cotyledons. A strong signal was obtained after wounding which could be explained by induction of the acidic chitinase itself or of an isoform. Therefore infiltration did not prove to be an appropriate method for applying SAR inducers in cucumber, because it probably induced a wound response.</p><p>When applied by spraying, BTH, L-&#x003b1;-amino butyric acid and 2-thiouracil strongly induced PR-8 mRNA accumulation, while SA treatment led to a lower induction level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Thiamine and BaCl<sub>2 </sub>induced slightly <italic>PR-8 </italic>expression (results not shown). RNA from control plants did not show any hybridization signal indicating that spraying itself did not induce <italic>PR-8 </italic>expression. BTH, which is an analogue of salicylic acid, showed the strongest <italic>PR-8 </italic>induction. But cucumber plants treated with 1 mM BTH showed a reduced growth (smaller leaves area and shorter internodes). As BTH was shown to be a very efficient activator of disease resistance in different plant species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], we tried to induce SAR in cucumber plants with lower BTH concentrations (10 &#x003bc;M, 30 &#x003bc;M and 100 &#x003bc;M). PR-8 transcript accumulation was quite similar for the three concentrations (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Additional file 1</xref>) and no adverse effect on plant growth was observed.</p><p>In cucumber, SAR has been shown to be effective against anthracnose caused by <italic>Colletotrichum lagenarium </italic>and salicylic acid treatment was shown to induce resistance against this pathogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. To confirm that BTH acts as a chemical inducer of SAR in cucumber, four-week-old plants were sprayed with water, 10 &#x003bc;M BTH, 50 &#x003bc;M BTH, or left untreated, 5 days prior to inoculation of the second true leaf with <italic>C. lagenarium</italic>. Two weeks after inoculation, the plants were scored for spreading lesions, i.e. lesions showing a larger size than the initial inoculated area. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, BTH treatment resulted in decreased symptoms. Control leaves inoculated with <italic>C. lagenarium </italic>showed large spreading lesions and thus extensive fungal growth. Treatment of plants with BTH prior to <italic>C. lagenarium </italic>inoculation resulted in a markedly decreased lesion formation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In untreated plants and water treated plants, 67 and 64 % of inoculation sites showed spreading lesions respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In BTH treated plants, only 23 % (10 &#x003bc;M BTH) or 9 % (50 &#x003bc;M BTH) of inoculated sites developed spreading lesions (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><p>To check whether BTH is able to act systemically or is transported through cucumber plants, the third leaf of four-week-old plants was wrapped with a plastic film and the plants were sprayed with H<sub>2</sub>O, 10 &#x003bc;M BTH, 50 &#x003bc;M BTH or left untreated. This leaf was inoculated with <italic>C. lagenarium </italic>7 days later. The percentage of spreading lesions on third leaves from pathogen-challenged untreated or H<sub>2</sub>O treated cucumber plants (infected controls) were respectively 86% and 83.5%. In BTH treated plants, 38 % (10 &#x003bc;M BTH) or 12 % (50 &#x003bc;M BTH) of inoculated sites developed spreading lesions (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). These results suggest that BTH can activate resistance in untreated leaves.</p></sec><sec><title>Differential expression of genes in BTH induced cucumber plants</title><p>Plants were sprayed with 10 &#x003bc;M BTH or water. Sampling was performed 24 h after treatment in order to point out early-induced differences in gene expression. RT-PCR products were separated on polyacrylamide gels. Bands that appeared on the display of RNA only from BTH treated plants, or only from water treated plants were likely to correspond to differentially expressed mRNAs. Twelve differentially expressed bands were identified (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Their sizes ranged between 250 and 450 bp. They corresponded to genes expressed in the BTH treated plants and not in the control ones or presenting a higher expression in the BTH treated plants compared to the control ones (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These bands were eluted from the gel, PCR amplified and cloned in the pGEM-T vector. In order to confirm the differential expression of these genes, reverse slot blot hybridizations were performed: DNA from four to ten clones obtained from each differentially displayed band was fixed on a membrane and hybridized with the corresponding reverse transcribed products from either BTH or H<sub>2</sub>O treated plants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Six from the twelve fragments were confirmed to be differentially expressed: dd3, dd4, dd5, dd6, dd7 and dd11. Five bands (dd1, dd8, dd9, dd10 and dd12) were either expressed evenly between BTH and H<sub>2</sub>O treated plants (differential display false positives or signal masked by the expression of homologous genes). In the remaining case (dd2), no signal could be observed on the slot blots. This absence of hybridization signal could be due to a lack of sensitivity of the slot blot hybridization procedure.</p><p>The dd3, dd4, dd5, dd6, dd7 and dd11 cDNA fragments were sequenced. Blast analysis did not lead to identification of any homology with known sequences. This is not surprising as mRNA differential display generates fragments corresponding to 3'untranslated regions for which homologies are difficult to find. Two of the six fragments were proved to be part of the same gene (dd5 and dd7). A cDNA library was constructed from cucumber plants sprayed with 10 &#x003bc;M BTH (leaves were sampled 24 h after treatment). The library was screened with the five differentially expressed fragments. Hits were obtained for four of these probes (corresponding to dd3, dd4, dd6 and dd11). Full length cDNAs corresponding to dd4, dd6 and dd11 were obtained. Homology between cloned cDNA and sequences in databases is presented in table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>. The cDNA dd3 matched to a putative RAS-related GTP-binding protein from <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. It will be referred to as CRG (cucumber RAS-related GTP-binding protein). The cDNA dd4 matched to a translation releasing factor 2. It will be referred to as CTR (cucumber translation releasing factor 2). The cDNA dd6 matched to a putative &#x003b2;-1,4-<italic>N</italic>-Acetylglucosaminyltranferase III from <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. This protein was named CGT (cucumber acetylglucosaminyltransferase III). The cDNA dd11 matched to a putative pathogenesis related protein from <italic>A. thaliana </italic>and, with slightly less homology, to a pathogenesis related protein from barley induced by fungal infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. It will be referred to as CPR (cucumber pathogenesis-related protein).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>PR-8</italic>, <italic>CPR</italic>, <italic>CRG and CGT </italic>expression analysis</title><p>To investigate the expression of <italic>PR-8</italic>, <italic>CPR</italic>, <italic>CRG </italic>and <italic>CGT </italic>genes in cucumber, the two first leaves of four-week old plants were sprayed with 10 &#x003bc;M BTH. In another batch of plants, the first leaf was inoculated with <italic>C. lagenarium</italic>. Total RNA was extracted from treated leaves or upper untreated leaves at various times after treatment. Accumulation of the PR-8, CPR, CRG and CGT mRNAs was assayed by Northern blotting followed by hybridization with the corresponding cDNA probes (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><p>Expression of <italic>PR-8 </italic>gene was induced at a high level by both 10 &#x003bc;M BTH spraying and <italic>C. lagenarium </italic>infection in the leaves submitted to the treatment.

No significant PR-8 mRNA accumulation could be detected in the untreated leaves from BTH sprayed plants, while in non infected leaves <italic>PR-8 </italic>expression was observed 72 h after infection by <italic>C. lagenarium</italic>; the level of expression was still increasing 2 weeks after <italic>C. lagenarium </italic>inoculation.</p><p><italic>CPR </italic>gene expression was strongly induced in both 10 &#x003bc;M BTH treated and <italic>C. lagenarium </italic>inoculated leaves.

Nevertheless the expression of <italic>CGT </italic>was increased both by spraying with 10 &#x003bc;M BTH (with a maximum at 24 h) and by inoculation with <italic>C. lagenarium </italic>(with a maximum at 72 h) in the leaves submitted to the treatment. A systemic induction could also be observed in untreated leaves from <italic>C. lagenarium </italic>inoculated plants (as from 72 h after infection).</p><p>The expression level of the <italic>CRG </italic>gene was too low to allow us to show an induction of the expression (data not shown).</p><p>Expression of the same genes was analyzed in wounded cucumber plants. A cut was made from the midvein to the outer edge of the first leaf. Total RNA was extracted from the cut leaf or the upper leaf, 24 and 48 h after wounding. An induction of the expression of <italic>PR-8 </italic>and <italic>CPR </italic>genes was only observed in the cut leaf 24 h after wounding. No expression was observed later nor in the uncut upper leaf. The <italic>CGT </italic>and <italic>CRG </italic>genes were not induced by wounding (results not shown).</p><p>Expression of these genes was also analyzed in cucumber plants showing rhizobacteria-induced systemic resistance.

Total RNA was extracted from cotyledons collected three weeks after sowing. <italic>PR-8</italic>, <italic>CPR</italic>, <italic>CGT </italic>and <italic>CRG </italic>did not show any induction of expression in these conditions (results not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We tested here two different techniques and several compounds to induce SAR in cucumber. The expression of <italic>PR-8 </italic>gene, which encodes an acidic chitinase from cucumber, was used as an indicator of the activation of the defense response. The accumulation of this acidic chitinase after tobacco necrosis virus infection or salicylic acid induction correlates with induced resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Among the different compounds tested, BTH applied by spraying proved to be the stronger inducer of PR-8 mRNA accumulation. BTH sprayed at a concentration of 10 &#x003bc;M was still able to induce <italic>PR-8 </italic>gene expression. The protective effects of BTH on cucumber were confirmed in challenge experiments with <italic>C. lagenarium</italic>. Spraying cucumber plants with BTH (10 &#x003bc;M or 50 &#x003bc;M) allowed effective local and systemic protection against <italic>C. lagenarium</italic>. BTH was recently identified as a safe, reliable and non phytotoxic plant protection agent by scientists at Novartis. Exogenous application of BTH to tobacco, <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, wheat and cucumber has been shown to activate a number of SAR associated genes leading to enhanced plant protection against various pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Identifying SAR induced genes could provide clues to elucidate the signal transduction pathway leading to plant defense responses. We used RT-PCR differential display in BTH-treated cucumber plants to detect SAR associated mRNAs. We have identified four BTH-inducible genes: a putative ras-related GTP binding protein (CRG), a putative translation releasing factor 2 (CTR), a putative &#x003b2;-1,4-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminyltranferase III (CGT) and a putative pathogenesis related protein (CPR). Expression of <italic>PR-8</italic>, <italic>CPR </italic>and <italic>CGT </italic>genes was shown to be induced by 10 &#x003bc;M BTH treatment as well as <italic>C. lagenarium </italic>infection. The response to BTH was observed earlier (5 h after treatment) than the one developed after pathogen inoculation (72 h after infection). However, systemic expression of these genes was only observed in <italic>C. lagenarium </italic>infected plants.</p><p>Small GTP-binding proteins form a large family of nucleotide triphosphatases whose activity is related to the binding, hydrolysis and release of guanosine triphosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. MAP kinase cascade represents an important downstream effector pathway for RAS in most cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and recent studies have shown that MAP kinases are activated in plants in response to pathogen attack and wounding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Small GTP-binding proteins have been shown to be involved in important cell mechanisms like cell division, transduction of external signals across the plasma membrane, endocytosis and exocytosis, cell death in plants and establishment of plant defense reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The &#x003b2;-1,4-<italic>N</italic>-Acetylglucosaminyltranferase III catalyses the addition of <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine to the &#x003b2;-mannoside of the tri-mannose core in <italic>N</italic>-glycans, resulting in the suppression of further processing and elongation. In mammals, <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III expression is associated with differentiation, cell adhesion and tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. It was shown recently to interfere with epidermal growth factor signaling and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced activation of protein kinase C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. <italic>N</italic>-linked glycans were shown to be widely distributed in plants and highly expressed at the cell surface, which might suggest a putative function in cell/cell communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. To our knowledge &#x003b2;-1,4-<italic>N</italic>-Acetylglucosaminyltranferase has never been described in the context of a plant-pathogen interaction. Several cDNAs or gene encoding enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of complex <italic>N</italic>-linked glycans have been cloned from plants. They include <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminyltranferase I cDNAs from <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, potato and tobacco [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II cDNA from <italic>A. thaliana </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] and defense-related glucosyl transferase gene from tomato [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. GTP-binding proteins and <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminyltranferases are involved in important mechanisms, notably signaling pathways and therefore seem of high interest. The putative PR protein, which has been first identified in barley after fungal infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] has no known function.</p><p>Only <italic>PR-8 </italic>and <italic>CPR </italic>genes were induced by wounding but not systemically. <italic>PR-8 </italic>and <italic>CPR </italic>genes were not induced by <italic>P. putida </italic>BTP1 treatment, which triggers induced systemic resistance (ISR) in cucumber. ISR is phenotypically similar to SAR but the mechanisms of this resistance were shown to be different: although this was not tested with <italic>P. putida </italic>BTP1, in other experimental systems ISR was shown to be dependent on NPR/NIM1 function, but does not involve salicylic acid, nor PR protein accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Our results correlate with those of Pieterse et al. who showed that induced systemic resistance in <italic>A. thaliana </italic>was independent of <italic>PR </italic>genes expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. In the same way, ISR also seems to be independent on <italic>CGT </italic>and <italic>CRG </italic>expression, as these genes were not induced by <italic>P. putida </italic>BTP1.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Among different SAR inducers tested on cucumber, BTH proved to be very efficient. Applied by spraying, BTH induced PR-8 mRNA accumulation and allowed effective local and systemic protection against <italic>C. lagenarium</italic>. Using RT-PCR differential display, we identified four BTH-inducible genes, including a putative ras-related GTP binding protein (CRG), a translation releasing factor 2 (CTR), a putative &#x003b2;-1,4-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminyltranferase III (CGT) and a putative pathogenesis related protein (CPR). Genes expression studies confirmed the local induction of <italic>CGT </italic>and <italic>CPR </italic>after BTH treatment or <italic>C. lagenarium </italic>infection and their systemic induction in response to <italic>C. lagenarium </italic>infection. Moreover <italic>CPR </italic>was locally induced by wounding. The significant level of expression of <italic>CGT </italic>and <italic>CPR </italic>genes during defense responses suggests a potential role for the gene products in the SAR pathway or in the state of resistance in cucumber.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Organisms and growth conditions</title><p>Cucumber plants (<italic>Cucumis sativus </italic>cv. <italic>Marketer</italic>) were grown in compost at 22&#x000b0;C with a 16 h light photoperiod.</p><p>Cultures of <italic>Colletotrichum lagenarium </italic>were maintained on malt agar at 25 &#x000b0;C.
