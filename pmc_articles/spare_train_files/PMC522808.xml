In Drosophila epithelial cells, the predominant APC relative (E-APC) is concentrated at the apicolateral adherens junctions. Genetic analysis indicates that this junctional association is critical for the function of E-APC in Wnt signalling and in cellular adhesion. Here, we ask whether the junctional association of E-APC is stable, or whether E-APC shuttles between the plasma membrane and the cytoplasm.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We generated a Drosophila strain that expresses E-APC (dAPC2) tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP-E-APC) and we analysed its junctional association with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments in live embryos. This revealed that the junctional association of GFP-E-APC in epithelial cells is highly dynamic, and is far less stable than that of the structural components of the adherens junctions, E-cadherin, &#x003b1;-catenin and Armadillo. The shuttling of GFP-E-APC to and from the plasma membrane is unaltered in mutants of Drosophila glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), which mimic constitutive Wingless signalling. However, the stability of E-APC is greatly reduced in these mutants, explaining their apparent delocalisation from the plasma membrane as previously observed. Finally, we show that GFP-E-APC forms dynamic patches at the apical plasma membrane of late embryonic epidermal cells that form denticles, and that it shuttles up and down the axons of the optic lobe.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We conclude that E-APC is a highly mobile protein that shuttles constitutively between distinct subcellular locations.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein is an important tumour suppressor in the colonic epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. A key function of this highly conserved protein is to antagonize Wnt signalling, by constitutively downregulating the transcriptional activity of &#x003b2;-catenin/Armadillo, a key effector of the Wnt signalling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Loss of this function is thought to be critical in the initiation of colorectal tumorigenesis as it causes a transcriptional switch in the intestinal epithelium towards actively dividing crypt progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. APC proteins are highly conserved among vertebrates and flies, and flies encode two APC proteins with overlapping roles in Wnt signalling during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>However, APC proteins have additional functions in connection with the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons that appear to be separate from their function in controlling Wnt signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. One of these functions is a role of APC in facilitating cellular adhesion, as indicated by studies in Drosophila tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and in mammalian colorectal cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This function in cellular adhesion is likely to be conferred by the subcellular pool of APC protein that is associated with adherens junctions (AJs) in Drosophila [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and in polarised mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The mechanism by which APC facilitates cellular adhesion is unknown.</p><p>In order to explore this mechanism, we asked whether Drosophila E-APC (also called dAPC2) might have a structural role at AJs. If so, E-APC would be expected to be stably associated with AJs, similarly to the structural components of the adhesive complex. As in mammalian epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], the main functional components of this complex in Drosophila are the transmembrane protein E-cadherin, a calcium-dependent trans-membrane adhesion molecule, and the catenins (Armadillo and &#x003b1;-catenin) that link E-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton at the cytoplasmic side [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. We thus conducted photobleaching experiments on live embryos expressing E-APC or structural AJ components tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], to compare their relative mobility. These experiments revealed that GFP-E-APC is less stably associated with AJs than their structural components. We also found that GFP-E-APC is remarkably mobile in neurons.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We used the GAL4 system to express GFP-E-APC throughout the embryo, and found that its subcellular distribution is very similar to that of endogenous E-APC in fixed embryos. In particular, GFP-E-APC is concentrated underneath the plasma membrane in apicolateral regions of embryonic epithelial cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). These regions form the zonula adherens (ZA) which contains the AJs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]; they can also be visualised with antibody staining against &#x003b1;-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>), and we observe a remarkably close coincidence of GFP-E-APC and &#x003b1;-catenin. Similar results were obtained by Akong at el. who examined the same GFP-E-APC transgene in the embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and who also showed that GFP-E-APC is distributed similarly as endogenous E-APC in larval neuroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Association of GFP-E-APC with AJs of embryonic epithelial cells.

We bleached the fluorescence in a defined square centred over the junctional region of an epithelial cell with a short laser pulse, and examined the recovery of the fluorescence within this square over time (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). This revealed a relatively fast rate of recovery of most of the fluorescence within a few minutes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>) [see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">additional file 1</xref>]. Quantitative analysis shows that nearly 80% of the initial fluorescence is recovered within ~220 seconds (with a half-time value of ~60 seconds) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a,4e</xref>). This indicates that the association of E-APC with the ZA is dynamic rather than stable. The fluorescence recovery observed in these FRAP experiments could be due to movement of E-APC between the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane, but also to sideways movement along the plasma membrane (see also below).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>FRAP of GFP-E-APC and GFP-tagged AJ proteins in early embryonic epithelial cells.

In these cases, we can only recover a small fraction of the initial fluorescence within the time frame of the experiment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a,4b,4c,4d,4e</xref>; note that these experiments cannot be extended beyond ~6 minutes, due to the extensive cell shape changes during this developmental stage). Furthermore, the rate of recovery is slower than that observed with GFP-E-APC, with estimated half-times of &#x0003e;3 minutes (&#x003b1;-catenin-GFP and of E-cadherin-GFP; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b,4d,4e</xref>). This also appears to be true for Armadillo-GFP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c,4e</xref>), though we cannot estimate its half-time of recovery with confidence, given that its fluorescence levels are considerably lower than that of the other GFP-tagged protein examined in this study.</p><p>We conclude that E-APC is significantly more mobile than the structural AJ components. This suggests that E-APC shuttles either within the cortex, along the zonula adherens, or that it shuttles from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane (as previously proposed; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]). Interestingly, the observed rates of recovery of GFP-E-APC were much slower than the estimated rate of free diffusion (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]; the rate of recovery of GFP alone was &#x0003c;10 seconds, i.e. too fast to be measured by our experimental setup). This suggests that the movements of GFP-E-APC are primarily determined by the kinetics of its binding to ligands. One of these could be Axin which associates with E-APC in Drosophila cells to from large dot-like structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Similarly, Axin associates with APC in mammalian cells to form large molecular weight protein complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Our observations argue against a structural role of E-APC in cellular adhesion. However, they are consistent with a catalytic role of E-APC in facilitating cellular adhesion, for example by maintaining the junctional pool of Armadillo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In support of this, recent evidence suggests that there is rapid exchange of &#x003b2;-catenin within the junctional cadherin complex, and that APC is required for this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>In late embryonic stages, GFP-E-APC forms striking patches underneath the apical plasma membrane of epidermal cells that are in the process of forming denticle extrusions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). These striking 'pre-denticle' patches are also seen in embryos stained with antibody against E-APC, and overlap with actin patches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. They may thus represent an actin-dependent association of E-APC as that seen in the cortex of earlier epithelial cells and at the ring canals between nurse cells within the egg chambers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. FRAP experiments revealed that the presence of GFP-E-APC in these pre-denticle patches is also dynamic, with an estimated half-time of fluorescence recovery of 200&#x02013;300 seconds (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Again, E-APC is therefore unlikely to have a structural role in these patches.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>FRAP of GFP-E-APC patches in late embryonic epithelial cells. Face-on views of ~17 hours old embryo (stage 17) expressing GFP-E-APC, showing patches of GFP-E-APC at the apical plasma membrane of epidermal cells forming denticles (pre-bleach and subsequent images labelled as in Fig. 3). Note the fast recovery of the fluorescence in these patches after photobleaching.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-5-37-5"/></fig><p>It has been reported that E-APC and Armadillo are required for anchoring mitotic spindles in the cortex of dividing blastoderm cells in the early Drosophila embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We cannot measure the kinetics of GFP-E-APC association with the cortex in these early embryonic cells, because of insufficient expression levels at this stage. However, assuming that these kinetics do not change radically during embryonic development, our observations from the later embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) suggest that E-APC has a catalytic role in capturing microtubules in the cellular cortex, rather than providing a structural tether [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>We also expressed GFP-E-APC in eye imaginal discs, to examine its subcellular distribution within a larval epithelial sheet. We thus noticed striking puncta of green fluorescence within the axons of the optic stalk that connects these discs to the larval brain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). These puncta resemble the E-APC/Axin-GFP dots that we observe in embryonic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and in these axons (not shown), and also the E-APC/Armadillo dots that Peifer and colleagues observed in early embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. They may thus represent the Axin destruction complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. We performed FRAP experiments, bleaching a 6 &#x003bc;m wide strip perpendicularly across the axons and monitoring the recovery of the fluorescence into the bleached section. This revealed that the GFP-E-APC puncta are remarkably dynamic: they re-appear within the bleached area within a minute, with an estimated half-time of ~100 seconds (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) [see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">additional file 2</xref>]. Many of these puncta seem to re-appear from other focal planes, so we cannot be absolutely certain that they represent movement of existing puncta. However, some of the puncta re-appearing in the bleached area can clearly be traced as moving puncta within the same focal plane (e.g. see isolated axon, left-hand side of [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">additional file 2</xref>]). The movement of these GFP-E-APC puncta may be due to tracking (e.g. along microtubules), although we cannot see uni-directionality of movement (i.e. the movement appears to be up and down the axons). The movement we observe in these axons is somewhat reminiscent of that observed with a GFP-tagged truncation of Xenopus APC that misses its C-terminus (thus resembling the overall structure of E-APC): this truncation, despite lacking the putative microtubule-interacting domain within its C-terminus, forms large puncta that can track along microtubules in Xenopus tissue culture cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>FRAP of GFP-E-APC in the larval optical stalk.

The normal level of Wingless signalling in the embryonic epidermis does not appear to change the subcellular distribution of bulk E-APC protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], although it does cause a re-location of Axin-GFP/E-APC complexes to the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. However, a reduction of cortical E-APC has been observed in early <italic>sgg </italic>mutant embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Likewise, in older <italic>sgg </italic>mutant embryos, the levels of membrane-associated GFP-E-APC are also noticeably reduced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7a,7b,7c</xref>). However, this does not appear to be due to a change in mobility of GFP-E-APC since the kinetics of fluorescence recovery between wild-type and <italic>sgg </italic>null mutant embryos were comparable (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4f</xref>). Instead, it is due to a reduction of the overall E-APC protein levels in these mutants: Western blot analysis of 2&#x02013;16 hour old embryos revealed that the total levels of GFP-E-APC protein were much lower in <italic>sgg </italic>mutant embryos compared to the wild type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7d</xref>). The same is true for endogenous E-APC whose levels are also substantially reduced in <italic>sgg </italic>mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7e</xref>). This indicates that <italic>sgg </italic>is required for the stability of E-APC protein, and it suggests that sustained Wingless signalling may destabilise E-APC. Similarly, phosphorylation by GSK3 is required for the stability of mammalian Axin, a functional binding partner of APC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and the levels of Drosophila Axin in embryos are also reduced after prolonged Wingless signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Destabilisation of the main components of the Axin complex (Axin and APC) during Wnt signalling may be a positive feedback mechanism resulting in the amplification of the signalling level.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Destabilisation of E-APC in <italic>sgg </italic>mutant embryos.

The enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting system (Amersham) was used for detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Live imaging of embryos</title><p>For live imaging, embryos were dechorionated in 50% bleach for 1&#x02013;2 minutes and washed. Embryos were transferred to a moistened black filter (Schleicher and Sch&#x000fc;ll). Embryos were adhered to coverslips with heptane glue, made by mixing heptane and clear sellotape (Sellotape Ltd). Embryos were mounted in Voltalef oil (10S). For short term imaging (&#x0003c;30 minutes), embryos were mounted on a glass slide with small coverslips as supports. For longer term imaging, e.g. for bleaching of pre-denticle patches, embryos were mounted in oil and placed on Bio-foil gas permeable membrane (Sartorius Ltd) mounted on a perspex frame [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Photobleaching of live embryos</title><p>FRAP experiments were performed using a Bio-Rad Radiance confocal microscope with a 40&#x000d7; NA 1.3 objective lense. Imaging was performed with a 488 nm argon laser at 5% laser power and the following confocal settings: iris at 4 mm, 50% gain, zoom 10, scan speed 500 lps, box size 512 &#x000d7; 512 pixels. These conditions were found to give minimal photobleaching over the observed time.</p><p>For each FRAP experiment, a pre-bleach image was recorded by selecting a focal plane and taking a Z-series, consisting of 3 0.5 &#x003bc;m steps either side of the desired focal plane (from -1.5 &#x003bc;m to +1.5 &#x003bc;m). The LaserSharp software was used to define several regions of interest (ROIs) for bleaching. A maximum of one bleach ROI was placed in any cell and several cells were always left unbleached. Typically, 3&#x02013;5 ROIs were bleached in one field of view on one embryo. These regions were bleached at 100% laser power (scanning at 500 lps). 10 bleach scans were found to produce the best results for all constructs. After bleaching, a Z-series was recorded every 15 seconds for 5 minutes. At the time of these experiments, the LaserSharp software did not contain a function for performing this type of 4D bleaching experiment. This problem was overcome by manually switching between imaging and bleaching settings and manually saving pre bleach images and starting the time course. As a result of this, there was usually a 30&#x02013;60 second delay between the pre-bleach image and the post-bleach images.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data sets were analysed with the Bio-Rad LaserPix software. For each time point, the total pixel intensity distribution was compared to the pre-bleach image to select the corresponding region. The two images were then compared by eye to confirm that they did correspond to the same focal plane. The coordinates for the bleach ROIs were used to accurately locate the bleach spots on the pre bleach image, and the mean fluorescence intensity for each ROI was calculated. Several equivalent sized ROIs were also placed on unbleached cells to measure any change in fluorescence due to photobleaching or movement.</p><p>To track movement of the cells, an acetate sheet was placed over the computer monitor and each ROI was marked on it as well as the shapes of the cells surrounding it. By aligning the sheet with the appropriate cell shapes, the ROI could be appropriately positioned for each time point. This process was used to position each ROI on the appropriate image for each time point.</p><p>Once all ROIs had been placed on the image, the mean fluorescence intensities were calculated for each ROI, and their positions were saved on a copy of the image (See Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2.1</xref>). Data was exported to Microsoft Excel for analysis. Relative fluorescence was calculated for each bleach area by dividing fluorescence at time (t) by pre-bleach fluorescence. The change in fluorescence was plotted on a graph with Excel. For each construct tested, the data from multiple bleach experiments from multiple embryos were averaged to give the approximate rate of recovery.</p><p>Data sets were discarded for any of the following reasons. First, if movement of the embryo in the Z axis took the sample outside the range of the Z-series in any time point. Second, if movement in the X/Y axis was sufficient to move significant numbers of the bleach boxes outside of the observed region. Third, if an ROI ever left the field of view, all data points for that ROI was discarded. Fourth, all data sets were discarded if the intensities of the control ROIs changed dramatically at any point in the experiment, or showed a large general increase or decrease.</p><p>Pre-denticle structures were bleached in a similar manner to junctional E-APC described above.</p></sec><sec><title>Live imaging of the larval optic stalk</title><p>GFP-E-APC was expressed in eye imaginal discs by the GAL4 system, using the driver line GMR.GAL4 (described in FlyBase). Eye discs and brains were dissected from crawling third instar larvae in PBS. Eye discs were teased away from the brain and inverted to reveal the optic stalk. Whole disc/brains were mounted in a drop of PBS under a cover slip, supported by two smaller cover slips. Each disc was observed for no more than 30 minutes.</p></sec><sec><title>Photobleaching of the larval optic stalk</title><p>FRAP experiments were performed using a Bio-Rad Radiance confocal microscope and Bio-Rad LaserSharp software, using the 100&#x000d7; NA 1.4 objective lens. A narrow strip was bleached across the whole field of view by adjusting the size of the scanning area. These experiments were performed before a FRAP program was available for LaserSharp so bleaching was performed manually, leading to somewhat variable intervals between each stage of the experiment. The region was bleached with the 488 nm line of an argon laser for approximately 20 scans. Time courses were recorded after each bleaching experiment for 5 minutes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>A.C. developed and conducted most of the FRAP experiments; J.M. completed the analysis of GFP-E-APC in live and fixed <italic>sgg </italic>mutant embryos, including the Western blots; M.B. directed the study, helped with the microscopy and drafted the manuscript.
