Many studies investigated cell death initiation versus inhibition by <italic>Chlamydia pneumoniae </italic>in established cell lines but nothing is known in primary human aortic smooth muscle cells, a cell type among others known to be involved in the formation of the atherosclerotic plaque. Type of cell death was analyzed by various methods in primary aortic smooth muscle cells after infection with <italic>Chlamydia pneumoniae </italic>to investigate a possible pathogenic link in atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Chlamydiae were found to be localized up to 72 h post infection in aortic smooth muscle cells either as single bacteria or inside of large inclusions. Quantification of host cell death by lactate dehydrogenase release assay revealed strictly dose and time dependent lysis for all tested isolates of <italic>Chlamydia pneumoniae</italic>. Phosphatidylserine exposure was detected by flow cytometry in <italic>Chlamydia pneumoniae </italic>infected cells. Ultrastructure of <italic>Chlamydia pneumoniae </italic>infected human aortic smooth muscle cells showed extensive membrane- and organelle damage, chromatin condensation but no nuclear fragmentation. DNA fragmentation as well as cell membrane permeability was analyzed by TUNEL and NHS-biotin staining and occurred exclusively in cells carrying <italic>Chlamydia pneumoniae </italic>spots but not in smooth muscle cells with inclusions. These morphological features of cell death were not accompanied by an activation of caspase-3 as revealed by analysis of enzyme activity but involved mitochondrial membrane depolarization as shown by TMRE uptake and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study provides evidence that <italic>Chlamydia pneumoniae </italic>induce a spot like infection in human aortic smooth muscle cells, which results in a chimeric cell death with both apoptotic and necrotic characteristics. This aponecrotic cell death may assist chronic inflammation in atherosclerotic blood vessels.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Infection with <italic>Chlamydia pneumoniae </italic>(Cpn) usually causes acute respiratory tract infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Chronical infection with Cpn may also contribute to formation and progression of atherosclerotic lesions apart from the classical risk factors such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and hyperlipidemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Cpn has been extensively studied in the context of atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] because atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease are the leading causes of death in the United States, Europe and much of Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The obligate intracellular bacterium has been detected in atherosclerotic lesions by immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction and electron microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and has also been cultured from atheromatous plaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. On the cellular level smooth muscle cells and macrophages in the intima have been found to be infected with Cpn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In general terms, if the inflammatory response does not effectively neutralize or remove the offending agents, such as Cpn, it can continue indefinitely resulting in the progression of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p><italic>Chlamydiae </italic>exhibit a unique developmental cycle with two morphological distinct infectious and reproductive forms: the elementary- and the reticulate body. The life cycle proceeds for 48 &#x02013; 72 h and ends with pathogen release that may damage the host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Infection with this pathogen is accompanied by cytoplasmic alterations and damage of the host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. A balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic influences by <italic>Chlamydia </italic>can be postulated. On one hand it has been shown that <italic>Chlamydia psittaci </italic>and <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis </italic>can induce apoptosis <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. On the other hand established cell lines infected with Cpn or <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis </italic>were protected from apoptotic cell death induced by various stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Most of the studies investigating pro- and anti-apoptotic activity of Cpn were performed in tumor cells or established cell lines. Since the character of cell death is affected by host cell type and <italic>Chlamydia </italic>strain it is of relevance to determine cell death in <italic>Chlamydia </italic>infected primary cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. As regards the role of Cpn in atherosclerosis we need to understand death promoting and inhibiting capacities of Cpn in primary cultures of vascular cells.</p><p>Human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) play an important role in the development of atherosclerotic lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Therefore, we sought to clarify the nature of cell death induced by Cpn in HASMC.</p><p>Apoptosis and necrosis represent two extreme morphologically defined forms of cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Recently the hybrid term aponecrosis was introduced describing the incomplete execution of the internal apoptotic pathway and the following necrotic degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Whether smooth muscle cell death is apoptotic, necrotic or even aponecrotic in nature would predictably influence the inflammatory response in the plaque. Necrotic cells releasing their contents provoke inflammation, whereas in apoptosis dead cells are ingested by neighboring cells and, therefore, do not provoke an inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In order to characterize the fate of HASMC following infection with Cpn we analyzed cell death by morphological and biochemical methods.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Various morphological characteristics of bacterial infection in HASMC</title><p>In order to examine the morphological characteristics of Cpn infection HASMC as well as the tumor cell line HEp-2 were infected with Cpn-K6 and Cpn-VR1310, respectively, and stained after 24 h, 48 h and 72 h with anti-Cpn-MOMP antibody. According to the staining protocol intra- and extracellular localization of Cpn could be distinguished (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Already after 24 h, but also after 48 h and 72 h, HASMC as well as HEp-2 cells were infected with numerous bacteria. Round or oval shaped smooth bordered intracellular inclusions were found in tumor cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>) as well as HASMC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B,D</xref>). In contrast to tumor cells in primary HASMC Cpn were found also as single or rarely as irregular shaped, aggregated immunoreactive spots (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Quantification of morphology in HASMC revealed that after 72 h all cells were infected with at least one chlamydial spot (100% infection rate). Approximately 25% of the cells carried one or multiple inclusions. The different morphological characteristics in HASMC (inclusions, single and aggregated spots) could also be discriminated 48 h post infection. The ratio of cells carrying inclusions versus cells carrying spots was much higher in HEp-2 cells compared to HASMC irrespective of the infectious dose (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). This ratio did not considerably vary between different Cpn strains K6 and VR1310 or as a function of the number of bacteria used for infection. Spots were usually much lower in number and not as prominently observed in HEp-2 cells compared to HASMC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). In HASMC the number of spots increased with higher infectious doses while at the same time the number of inclusions remained constant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>) in contrast to Cpn infections of HEp-2 cells where more inclusions were formed at higher infectious doses without an increase of spots.</p></sec><sec><title>Cpn lyse HASMC in a dose-dependent manner</title><p>To compare the lytic capacity of different Cpn isolates and to identify a possible time course of host cell death during the chlamydial infectious cycle, LDH release of HASMC was analyzed at 24, 48 and 72 h post infection.</p><p>HASMC were inoculated with two different Cpn isolates: Cpn-VR1310 and Cpn-K6 at serial 2-fold dilutions ranging from 1 to 32 inclusion forming unit (IFU)/cell (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Both isolates were found to be free of <italic>Mycoplasma spec</italic>. contamination as assessed by PCR. LDH release of mock treated HASMC or of cells inoculated with heat inactivated bacteria was comparable to the spontaneous LDH release of uninfected cells (data not shown).</p><p>Both Cpn isolates lysed HASMC in a strictly dose dependent fashion at all time points analyzed. Cpn mediated host cell lysis at 48 h post infection is shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>. Data obtained from 24 h and 72 h post infection were similar and consistent with the displayed data subset. The levels of HASMC lysis induced by infection with 8 IFU/cell of Cpn-K6 (0.9% &#x000b1; 3) and Cpn-VR1310 (18.6% &#x000b1; 8) indicate large differences in the lytic capabilities of both Cpn isolates. Comparison of Cpn-induced LDH release at different time points (24, 48 and 72 h) demonstrated a constant increase in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-specific HASMC lysis indicating continuous triggering of cell death throughout the whole infectious cycle (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). In order to reach the same amount of HASMC lysis (27% &#x000b1; 2) 4 IFU/cell of Cpn-VR1310 and 32 IFU/cell of Cpn-K6 respectively were required. This suggests that for a given degree of HASMC lysis either high amounts of a lytically less active isolate or lower amounts of a lytically more active isolate are required.</p></sec><sec><title>Cpn infection of HASMC causes nuclear chromatin condensation as well as extensive damage of organelles and cell membrane</title><p>In order to discriminate between apoptotic and necrotic cell death of infected HASMC ultrastructural analysis by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out. As a control apoptosis was induced by treatment with the well described kinase inhibitor staurosporin.</p><p>Untreated HASMC had an elongated nucleus rich in euchromatin with one or two well-defined nucleoli (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). The cytoplasm was scattered by numerous narrow-spaced profiles of rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER), a small Golgi complex and single elongated mitochondria. In Cpn infected cultures a variable number of HASMC harbored large inclusions containing many infectious elementary bodies and metabolically active reticular bodies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The nucleus of these cells was slightly rounded but chromatin structure as well as morphology of organelles was unchanged. A large number of infected HASMC without Cpn inclusions were destroyed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). The round shaped nuclei showed a distinct condensation of heterochromatin and condensed nucleoli. Cell organelles including mitochondria and rER profiles were dilated and cell membranes were completely disrupted. Detection of single bacteria by TEM was possible only on rare occasions since distorted organelles in dying cells were barely distinguishable from Cpn.</p><p>Apoptotic HASMC treated with staurosporin showed a distinct condensation of chromatin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>) and nuclei were fragmented frequently; damage of cell membranes and swelling of organelles appeared to a lower extent than in Cpn infected HASMC.</p><p>In general the overall ultrastructural morphology of HASMC infected with spot-like Cpn infection suggests a hybrid form of cell death: it shares chromatin condensation with apoptosis and damage of organelles and membranes with necrosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Spot-like infection induces aponecrotic morphology in HASMC</title><p>The combination of chromatin staining by DAPI with labeling of DNA strand breaks via TUNEL staining and assessment of membrane integrity by NHS-biotin staining allows a distinction between necrosis as well as early and late phases of apoptosis using confocal laser scanning microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Cells dying by necrosis exhibit NHS-biotin labeling of the cytoplasm but not chromatin condensation or TUNEL staining of nuclei. Cells in early phases of apoptosis display nuclei with condensed or fragmented chromatin, with or without TUNEL staining, and are surrounded by NHS-biotin negative cytoplasm due to intact cell membranes. In late phases of the apoptotic cell death TUNEL positive nuclei occur together with a NHS-biotin positive cytoplasm.</p><p>HASMC were infected with Cpn for chosen periods of time or were inoculated with mock isolates or treated with staurosporin. Cells infected with Cpn-VR1310 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E, F</xref>) showed an identical staining pattern as cells infected with Cpn-K6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A &#x02013; D</xref>).</p><p>Mock inoculated cells displayed round or oval shaped nuclei with finely dispersed chromatin visualized by DAPI staining and were always TUNEL negative. NHS-biotin was bound exclusively to the cell surface indicating intact membranes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G</xref>).</p><p>In Cpn infected cultures a variable labeling pattern of HASMC was observed. Cells with Cpn inclusions always displayed normal chromatin staining and no TUNEL or NHS-biotin labeling (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). HASMC with spot-like infection either contained an unaltered nucleus and NHS-biotin negative cytoplasm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) or showed a TUNEL positive nucleus with condensed chromatin embedded in NHS-biotin stained cytoplasm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C, E</xref>). In HASMC displaying both Cpn spots and aggregates the nucleus was always labeled by TUNEL and the cytoplasm by NHS-biotin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E, F</xref>). Cpn-infected HASMC never showed membrane damage in combination with an unaltered nucleus, representing necrotic cell death. Cpn-infected HASMC displaying TUNEL positive nuclei and damaged membranes could be detected at 24, 48 and 72 h post infection. 8 h post infection was the earliest time point when TUNEL positive nuclei could be detected, suggesting induction of apoptosis during the whole life cycle of Cpn (not shown). TUNEL-positive HASMC were found even at infectious doses of 1 IFU / cell for Cpn-VR1310 and 8 IFU / cell for Cpn-K6 and the amount of TUNEL-positive HASMC increased strictly dependent on the chlamydial dose used for infection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5I</xref>). Again, both Cpn strains used in this study elicited the same features of cell death in HASMC according to the infection morphology. Identical to the lytic capacity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) of these strains, K6 had to be used at higher IFU compared to VR1310 to generate a similar number of cells with TUNEL-positive nuclei and NHS-biotin positive cytoplasm. In contrast to HASMC neither Cpn-K6 nor Cpn-VR1310 induced a concentration dependent increase in TUNEL positive nuclei in HEp-2 cells and numbers of TUNEL positive nuclei remained below 10% (not shown).</p><p>In staurosporin treated cells the rounded nuclei were fragmented or exhibited chromatin that was condensed marginally, whereas NHS-biotin labeling was predominantly negative (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5H</xref>). Just a minority of the cells revealed a condensed TUNEL-positive nucleus and at the same time were also NHS-biotin positive reflecting late stages of apoptotic cell death.</p></sec><sec><title>Cpn infection induces phosphatidylserine externalization in HASMC</title><p>HASMC were infected for 48 h with Cpn-K6 or -VR1310 in 2-fold dilutions ranging from 8 to 386 IFU/cell or from 1 to 32 IFU/cell, respectively. As controls cultures were inoculated with mock isolates or with heat inactivated bacteria (data not shown) and analyzed for annexin-V binding and propidium iodide uptake. Uninfected as well as Na-azide treated HASMC served as negative and staurosporin-treated cells as positive controls for apoptosis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref> upper right and upper left panel). Control cultures inoculated with mock lysate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) or heat inactivated bacteria and untreated cells showed always less than 20% annexin-V single positive cells. This proportion of annexin-V positive cells represented background staining, probably due to the experimental procedure. Upon infection with 128 IFU/cell of Cpn-K6 for 72 h the number of single annexin-V positive cells increased to more than 50% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Upon Cpn infection annexin-V and propidium iodide double-positive staining reached 10% as compared with 4% in mock-inoculated and 3% in untreated HASMC (not shown). In staurosporin treated cultures the amount of both annexin-V single and double positive cells increased strongly (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> upper left panel) indicating a continued induction of classical apoptotic cell death.</p><p>The amount of annexin-V single positive HASMC infected with Cpn increased linearly in a dose- (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>) and time- (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>) dependent manner. Cpn-VR1310 again induced phosphatidylserine externalization at much lower doses compared to Cpn-K6. Neither mock inoculation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A, B</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref> lower left panel), nor inoculation with heat inactivated bacteria (data not shown), induced apoptosis. This indicates that infection with living bacteria is required for induction of cell-death.</p><p>Taken together, the dose- and time dependence between infection and phosphatidylserine externalization were consistent with induction of early apoptotic events.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Chlamydia </italic>infection in HASMC induces caspase-3 independent cell death by dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential</title><p>After induction of apoptosis an enzymatic cascade is activated leading to the disassembly of the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Key enzyme in this cascade is caspase-3. However, in some cases apoptosis can proceed without involvement of caspase-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In order to investigate the role of caspase-3 HASMC were infected with Cpn-K6 128 IFU/cell or Cpn-VR1310 32 IFU/cell, respectively, for 48 h (24 h and 72 h not shown) or treated with 1 &#x003bc;M staurosporin for 12 h to induce apoptosis. Samples were analyzed for caspase-3 activation by measuring enzyme activity after lysing the cells. No activity of caspase-3 in Cpn infected HASMC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>) could be detected. In contrast distinct caspase-3 activity was found in staurosporin-treated cells.</p><p>A major role in the induction and regulation of cell death is played by mitochondria. Pro-apoptotic factors result at mitochondria in the dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c. After infection of HASMC with Cpn-K6 or Cpn-VR1310 cells were loaded with TMRE (tetramethylrhodamineethylester) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], a dye, that is only taken up into mitochondria with an intact mitochondrial potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Cells with intact membranes excluding propidium iodide were analyzed by flow cytometry.</p><p>The number of TMRE negative cells strictly increased with the chlamydial dose whereas blocking of chlamydial protein synthesis by addition of chloramphenicol completely abrogated this effect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). Moreover, labeling of Cpn-K6 infected or mock treated cells for cytochrome c and mitotracker red revealed distinct loss of cytochrome c staining of the mitochondria in the infected population (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>) but not in mock treated cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, the data suggest <italic>Chlamydia pneumoniae </italic>induce caspase-independent apoptosis-like cell death in infected HASMC by involving mitochondrial membrane dissipation resulting in the release of cytochrome c.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In our in vitro study cell death was only induced in HASMC by infection with viable Cpn but not after incubation with heat inactivated or chloramphenicol treated bacteria. Additionally, different Cpn isolates showed various lytic activities towards host cells that correlated to different reproduction rates in tumor cells as measured by real time PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. A reproductive infection would seem to be a prerequisite for cell death induction in HASMC. The observation that heat inactivated or chloramphenicol treated bacteria never caused changes of the host cells underlines that cell death induction is not a bystander effect of a potential cytopathic chlamydial component such as the heat stable LPS. It can be concluded that HASMC death depends on internalization of the <italic>Chlamydia </italic>and is associated with the suppression of bacterial replication and productive infection. The necessity for a reproductive infection was also shown for <italic>Chlamydia psittaci </italic>which induced caspase 3 independent apoptosis in macrophages and epithelial cells only after reproductive infection along with bacterial protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Cell death induction was never found in cells harbouring inclusions which normally are viewed as the manifestation of a reproductive infection. HASMC formed inclusions with a relatively low frequency compared to tumor cells. In contrast, spots resulting presumably from single bacteria were found frequently illustrating a different infection morphology of Cpn in these primary vascular cells. Currently no data are available regarding metabolism, protein synthesis and reproduction or functional relation with host cells of these single, spot-like bacteria. From our data it only can be concluded that these single bacteria are sensitive to chloramphenicol which inhibits protein synthesis in Cpn and abrogates cell death induction. Cell death seems to result from an interaction of the host cell with these single bacteria as it is ongoing for extended times.</p><p>Cpn induced cell death in HASMC did not fulfill all criteria for apoptosis or classical necrosis. Condensation of chromatin, positive TUNEL staining, externalization of phosphatidylserine, inhibition of TMRE labeling and loss of cytochrome c immunoreactivity in mitochondria were clear markers for apoptosis. But early damage of cell membrane and organelles as found by TEM and NHS-biotin labeling indicated necrotic type of cell death in Cpn infected cells. According to previous classifications Cpn mediated cell death belongs to apoptosis-like cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] or can be termed aponecrosis due to characteristic ultrastructural features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Cpn induced cell death in HASMC having features of necrosis and apoptosis is in agreement with a study employing mouse embryonic fibroblasts infected with <italic>C. trachomatis </italic>which died through a combination of necrosis and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>If cell death induction by Cpn in HASMC is caspase-3 independent the question arises about alternative pathways that are involved. Mitochondria are important regulators of cell death and loss of mitochondrial permeability transition is an important indication for apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Here we show by TMRE labeling dissipation of the mitochondrial potential of <italic>Chlamydia </italic>infected cells. This effect could be inhibited by blocking bacterial protein synthesis using chloramphenicol. Moreover, cytochrome c was released from mitochondria of infected HASMC as indicated by loss of immunorecactivity. The important role of mitochondria in <italic>Chlamydia </italic>induced cell death has also been shown in tumor cell lines infected with <italic>Chlamydia psittaci </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members like Bax were activated and apoptosis induction occurred during the whole chlamydial life cycle. Apoptosis induced by <italic>Chlamydia psittaci </italic>was blocked in cells over expressing Bax inhibitor and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Bax<sup>-/- </sup>mouse embryonic fibroblasts were shown to be resistant to <italic>Chlamydia muridarum</italic>-induced apoptosis and fewer bacteria were recovered after two infection cycles. This suggests that Bax-dependent apoptosis may be used to initiate a new round of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In a second study, <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis </italic>infected mouse fibroblasts showed a higher level of apoptosis than <italic>Chlamydia </italic>infected HeLa cells as measured by annexin V / propidium iodide double labeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This not only shows that Bax activation could reflect a stress response in infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] but that primary cells show a different stress response to <italic>Chlamydia </italic>infection than tumor cells.</p><p>Beside Bax other factors like apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) may be involved in caspase-independent cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] but they have never been investigated in <italic>Chlamydia</italic>-induced cell death. AIF which is upregulated and translocated from the mitochondria to the cytosol may play an important role in induction of caspase-3 independent cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Injection of AIF into the cytoplasm induces similar chromatin condensation coupled to phosphatidylserine exposure as we found in Cpn infected HASMC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Future experiments will have to show if AIF, Bax or other Bcl-2 family members are involved in Cpn induced HASMC death.</p><p>There exist numerous studies showing that Cpn and <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis </italic>prevent cells in vitro from undergoing apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. However, these experiments were performed on established cell lines. Our study shows that in primary cultures of cells such as HASMC various types of Cpn infection occur. Spot like infection resulted in aponecrosis whereas cells with Cpn inclusions appeared to be prevented from cell death. Apparently Cpn in inclusions have evolved strategies to inhibit cell death presumably to complete the developmental cycle. About possible mechanisms can be speculated: it has been shown that Cpn inserts components of a type-III secretion system into the inclusion membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and releases factors into the host cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] that affect host cell metabolism. Cpn secretes proteins that translocate from the inclusion to the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. CADD, a secreted protein from <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>, has been shown to interact with death domains and co-localizes with Fas. Recombinant CADD has been shown to induce caspase dependent apoptosis in several tumor cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Therefore, other yet unidentified proteins from <italic>Chlamydia </italic>could interact with the host cell death machinery and inhibit or promote cell death.</p><p>Currently, it is unclear how the observed morphology of Cpn in HASMC and the induced aponecrotic cell death affects the progression of atherosclerosis. Cpn infection of HASMC was accompanied by phosphatidylserine externalization which might result in the ingestion of dying cells by macrophages. Macrophages will then either stop further progress of Cpn mediated damage or in turn become activated and thereby contribute to inflammation in the atherosclerotic vessel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Early membrane damage found in the aponecrotic HASMC may provoke or assist inflammation in the atherosclerotic vessel due to release of cellular constituents. Finally damage of vascular smooth muscle cells by Cpn infection might lead to plaque instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Cpn infection of cultured HASMC results in cell death that can be termed aponecrosis due to the sharing of apoptotic and necrotic features. This form of cell death occurs just in cells bearing single or aggregated bacteria but not in cells with inclusions. Aponecrotic HASMC may in vivo assist chronic infection in the vascular wall supporting the progression of atherosclerosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Chlamydial organisms, cells, antibodies and reagents</title><p>Cpn-VR1310 and Cpn isolate Kajaani 6 (Cpn-K6) were kindly provided by G.

C, E: Cpn-K6 (C) or Cpn-VR1310 (E) infected HASMC with spot like infection (arrow heads). The condensed nucleus is TUNEL positive, the cytoplasm is diffusely labeled with NHS-biotin. D, F: HASMC with Cpn-K6 (D) or Cpn-VR1310 (F) in aggregated (arrow) spots and single spots (arrow heads). Note positive TUNEL labeling of the shrunken nucleus and NHS-biotin staining of the cytoplasm. G: Mock inoculated HASMC. Note the fine granular chromatin structure and lack of TUNEL- and cytoplasmic NHS-biotin staining. H: HASMC incubated with staurosporin. The nucleus exhibits a distinct nuclear fragmentation (DAPI staining) but no TUNEL labeling. The cytoplasm is NHS-biotin negative indicating an intact cell membrane.
