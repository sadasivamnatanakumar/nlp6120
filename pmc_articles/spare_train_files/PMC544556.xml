The risk of future joint problems, in the form of functional limitations, secondary lesions, and arthrosis, is increased following such an injury. Secondary effects commonly seen after an ACL injury include defective neuromuscular function with reduced strength and functional performance, a different movement and activation pattern, defective proprioception and impaired postural control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Impaired postural control has been reported after acute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and chronic ACL injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], as well as after ACL reconstruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Higher amplitude values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and longer reaction time when subjected to perturbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] have been observed among patients compared to controls. Studies have also shown that patients with better subjective function have lower amplitude values [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], Ageberg E, Roberts D, Holmstr&#x000f6;m E, Frid&#x000e9;n T: Balance in single-limb stance in individuals with anterior cruciate ligament injury &#x02013; relation to knee laxity, proprioception, muscle strength, and subjective function. Manuscript submitted]. The present study was initiated by the clinical knowledge that although patients with ACL injury have had extensive neuromuscular training and function well during daily life and (modified) physical activities, they experience a decreased ability to maintain balance during weight-bearing on the injured leg in demanding situations while fatigued. This may be related to an increased risk of further injuries.</p><p>Fatigue is caused by a combination of different physiological mechanisms occurring at both the central and peripheral levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], affecting afferent neuromuscular pathways, observed as proprioceptive deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and efferent neuromuscular pathways, seen, for example, as a delay in muscle response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Thus, muscular fatigue leads to a decline in work performance, which may also include effects on postural control. A decreased ability to maintain balance in bilateral stance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and single-limb stance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] after fatiguing exercise (i.e., higher values after exercise) has been reported in uninjured subjects, and it has been suggested that individuals are therefore at increased risk of injury when fatigued [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Studies of balance in single-limb stance are of importance and of interest since these movement patterns resemble the stance phase, and since many knee injuries occur during weight-bearing on one leg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge, no studies evaluating the effect of fatigue on postural control in subjects with ACL injury have been reported. The main purposes of this study were: 1) to examine the effect of short-duration, sub-maximal exercise performed on a cycle ergometer, on postural control, measured by stabilometry in single-limb stance on a force platform, in individuals with ACL injury in comparison with that of a control group of uninjured subjects, and 2) to explore the patients' instantaneous ability to maintain balance in single-limb stance after exercise, in comparison with that of the control group. Furthermore, the patients were compared to the control group in order to verify previous findings that postural control is affected in both legs by a unilateral ACL injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. No comparisons were, therefore, made between the injured and uninjured legs. Our hypothesis was that the patients with ACL injury would be more affected by exercise than the uninjured subjects, since fatigue has been shown to reduce postural control in healthy subjects, and since postural control may already be impaired due to the injury.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Thirty-six patients (18 men and 18 women) were included in the study. Inclusion criteria were: 1) age between 15 and 35 years, 2) unilateral, non-operated, non-acute ACL deficiency with or without associated lesions of other structures of the knee, 3) an uninjured contralateral extremity, back and neck, and 4) no history of neurological disease, vestibular or visual disturbance. Their mean age was 26 years (SD 5 years), mean height 174 cm (SD 9 cm), and mean body mass 72 kg (SD 13 kg). Their median activity level before injury was 6.5 (range 3 to 9) and on the test occasion 4 (range 1 to 9) according to the Tegner activity level scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The mean time elapsed from injury to the test occasion was 3.8 years (SD 3, range 0.5 to 11 years). The patients had undergone an extensive neuromuscular training program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] after the injury under the supervision of physical therapists, with a mean duration of 7 months (SD 5 months). A visual analog scale graded from 0 to 100 mm was used for subjective evaluation of extremity function, where 0 was "as if the knee had been recently injured" and 100 was "perfect" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The patients' mean value and median value on this scale were 68 mm and 59 mm (range 12&#x02013;95 mm), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Control group</title><p>The measurements of twenty-four uninjured volunteers (11 men and 13 women) from a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], with no history of neurological disease, major orthopedic lesion, vestibular or visual disturbance, constituted control values. Their mean age was 24 years (SD 3 years), mean height 176 cm (SD 8 cm), and mean body mass 71 kg (SD 13 kg). Their median activity level was 5 (range 2 to 9) according to the Tegner activity level scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The subjects in the control group were chosen in order to have the same distribution in age, sex, and physical activity as the patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. No significant difference was found between the groups in age, height, body mass or activity level. The Research Ethics Committee at Lund University approved the study. All subjects gave their written informed consent to participate in the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment</title><sec><title>Stabilometry</title><p>Balance in single-limb stance was tested by means of a strain gauge force plate (33 &#x000d7; 38 cm) with the subject barefoot in a standardized position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This measurement was performed before (pre-exercise) and immediately after fatiguing exercise (post-exercise). The foot was placed pointing straight forward in relation to reference lines in the frontal and sagittal planes (origin of coordinates). The other leg was flexed 90&#x000b0; at the hip and knee joints with both arms hanging relaxed at the sides. The subjects were instructed to stand as motionless as possible, looking straight ahead at a point on the wall 65 cm away; they were allowed to practice maintaining this position for about 20 s before three measurements on each leg were made, with the subjects standing alternately on their right and left leg. The test order between legs was randomized regarding injured/uninjured leg in the patient group (injured leg n = 20, uninjured n = 16), and regarding right/left leg in the control group (right leg n = 13, left n = 11). No differences were observed in the stabilometric measurements between these randomization groups. Accordingly, the assessment included three measurements made on each leg, giving a total of six measurements pre- and post-exercise, respectively. These six measurements lasted for approximately 3 1/2 minutes, with about 10 seconds between each measure. The median value of the three measurements on each leg was used to compare pre- and post-exercise values. Decreasing values in the three measurements have been observed in a previous study, indicating a learning effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Some degree of recovery may, therefore, occur during the three post-exercise measurements. For this reason, the first and third of the three post-exercise measurements on each leg were used, to evaluate the instantaneous value of the ability to maintain postural control (first measurement) and the possible recovery (third measurement). Movements of the center of pressure (CP) in the frontal plane (FP) and sagittal plane (SP) were recorded for 25 s at a sampling frequency of 20 Hz. A computer program (Viewdac 2.1, Keithley Instruments, Inc., Cleveland, Ohio, USA), was used to analyze the following variables: <italic>1) average speed of CP movements in mm&#x000b7;s<sup>-1</sup>; and 2) number of movements exceeding 10 mm from the mean value of CP (DEV 10)</italic>, giving a total of four variables (two variables in each plane). The mean value of CP is the average distance (mm) of the CP from the reference lines, and DEV 10 is the number of movements exceeding 10 mm from the mean value of CP. DEV 10 (n) reflects the deviation of CP (i.e., displacement of CP), and the average speed (mm&#x000b7;s<sup>-1</sup>) reflects the amplitude and frequency of CP movements. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows raw data from a stabilometry test. Average speed and DEV 10 were used in the present study, since our previous studies have shown that these variables are reliable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and sensitive in detecting differences between patients and uninjured subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and sensitive in detecting the effects of exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. We expected to find higher values after exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Short-duration sub-maximal exercise</title><p>Short-duration, sub-maximal exercise was performed on a cycle ergometer. The subjects' heart rate was continuously recorded during the entire test. Borg's scale for Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE scale) was used to assess the subjective effort level during exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. On this scale, numbers ranging from 6 to 20 are matched with descriptors (e.g., 6 = <italic>No exertion at all</italic>, 13 = <italic>Somewhat hard</italic>, 15 = <italic>Hard</italic>, 17 = <italic>Very hard</italic>, 19 = <italic>Extremely hard</italic>, and 20 = <italic>Maximal exertion</italic>). The RPE scale was designed to increase linearly with exercise intensity and heart rate for work on a bicycle ergometer, and correlates closely with several physiological variables, including heart rate and blood lactate concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. A linear relationship exists between heart rate and oxygen consumption with increasing rate of work. A given percentage of the maximum oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2max</sub>) results in a higher percentage of the maximum heart rate (HR<sub>max</sub>); e.g., 75% of VO<sub>2max </sub>represents an intensity of 86% of HR<sub>max </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The maximum heart rate can be estimated from the following equation: maximum heart rate (beats/min) = 220 &#x02013; age (years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Effects of fatigue are likely to occur after a few minutes of sub-maximal exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The rate of pedaling was kept constant at 60 revs/min. The level of exercise was calculated so as to be similar to that perceived during a general exercise session. The workload (W) was set individually, depending on the sex and physical condition of each subject, with the aim of reaching a heart rate above 60% of the predicted HR<sub>max </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] in all subjects. Cycling was stopped when the subjects had reached a heart rate exceeding 60% of the predicted HR<sub>max</sub>, perceived the exercise as hard or very hard (values 14&#x02013;17 of the RPE scale), and had reached steady-state heart rate, i.e., after approximately 5 min.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The average of the right and left legs; i.e., (right+left)/2, was used for statistical analysis in the control group, since there were no clinically or statistically significant differences between the legs. The use of the mean value of both legs when performing parametric statistics can be questioned, since this may affect the data variability. It cannot, however, be excluded that a dominance of one or the other side exists, which is difficult to define [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and therefore it is hard to determine which leg to use in comparison with the patients. For this reason we used the average of the right and left legs. However, the results were confirmed using the right and left legs separately as the control leg. The median value of the three measurements was used to compare pre- and post-exercise values. In addition, the first and third of the three post-exercise measurements were compared, to evaluate the instantaneous ability to maintain postural control in single-limb stance (first measurement) and the possible recovery (third measurement). We used the paired t-test for the intra-group comparisons, and the independent t-test for the inter-group comparisons, with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. The present study is of exploratory character, and the level of correction for multiple comparisons was chosen with regard to this. For each stabilometric variable, five separate t-tests were performed in comparisons between pre- and post-exercise values for the injured leg and the control group: 1) injured leg pre-exercise vs. post-exercise, 2) control group pre-exercise vs. post-exercise, 3) injured leg vs. control group pre-exercise, 4) injured leg vs. control group post-exercise, and 5) effects of exercise (post-exercise minus pre-exercise) injured leg vs. control group. These five t-test were also performed in the analysis of possible differences between pre- and post-exercise values for the uninjured leg and the control group. Since five comparisons were made in the above-mentioned analyses, the alpha level was set at 0.05/5 = 0.01. For each stabilometric variable, three separate t-tests were performed in comparisons between post-exercise measurements 1 and 3 for the injured leg and the control: 1) injured leg measurement 1 vs. measurement 3, 2) control group measurement 1 vs. measurement 3, and 3) effects of exercise (measurement 3 minus measurement 1) injured leg vs. control group. These three t-tests were also performed in the analysis of possible differences between post-exercise measurements 1 and 3 for the uninjured leg and the control group. Since three comparisons were made in the above-mentioned analyses, the alpha level was set at 0.05/3 = 0.02. The statistical analyses were performed using the program package SPSS 11.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Fatiguing exercise</title><p>All subjects exceeded the 60% value of the predicted HR<sub>max</sub>; the mean level being 82% (SD 6%, range 66 to 92%) among the patients and 81% (SD 7%, range 68 to 99%) among the controls. The median power output produced by the patients and the control group at the end of fatiguing exercise was 125 W (range 75 to 200 W) and 150 W (range 100 to 200 W), respectively, and the mean value of perceived exertion, rated according to the RPE scale, was 15.8 (SD 1.1) and 15.4 (SD 0.9), respectively. The final heart rate attained among the patients and the control group was 159 beats/min (SD 11 beats/min) and 159 beats/min (14 beats/min), respectively, and the heart rate after the stabilometric assessment, approximately 3 1/2 minutes after exercise, was 112 beats/min (SD 14 beats/min) and 117 beats/min (SD 16 beats/min), respectively.

In the intra-group comparisons, three of four variables showed higher values post- than pre-exercise in the uninjured leg, and two of four variables were higher post-exercise in the injured leg. In the control group, one of four variables was higher post- than pre-exercise (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). However, no differences in the effects of fatigue (mean difference of post-exercise minus pre-exercise values) were found in the inter-group comparisons (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, and Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The variables were more sensitive in detecting the effects of exercise in the FP than in the SP. The primary motions of the knee joint occur in the SP, and the joint has limited capacity to make postural adjustments in the FP due to anatomical constraints, whereas the hip joint and ankle are involved in postural corrections in both the FP and SP during weight-bearing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Since many injuries to the knee occur during weight-bearing on one leg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]; i.e., in a closed kinetic chain including the hip joint and ankle, it is of interest to examine postural control in both the FP and SP in individuals with ACL injury. The results of a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and the present one indicate that measurements in the FP may be more sensitive and revealing in detecting effects of exercise than measurements in the SP.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that afferent information has an effect on the neuromuscular function of both the ipsilateral and contralateral limb muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], which may explain why more variables were higher post- than pre-exercise not only in the injured leg, but also in the uninjured one, than in the control group. Several studies have reported bilateral defects in postural control after an ACL injury or reconstruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], which may be due to central nervous system modifications following the loss of knee mechanoreceptors after the injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Another explanation may be that the patients had inherently poor balance, which might have contributed to the original injury. This has been reported by Tropp et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], where soccer players with abnormal stabilometric values (defined as a value exceeding 2 SD of the mean value in a control group), ran a higher risk of sustaining an ankle injury than players with normal values.</p><p>In a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], we observed decreasing values in the three measurements, indicating a learning effect. In another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], fatigue was shown to interfere with this learning process, which is in agreement with the results that we found on the uninjured leg and in the control group. However, the injured leg reacted differently from the uninjured one, and the control group when the first and third of the post-exercise measurements were compared. It was assumed that the first measurement could provide us with the instantaneous value of the ability to maintain postural control in single-limb stance. The results showed that the third measurement was lower, or tended to be lower, than the first in the injured leg, regarding average speed and DEV 10 in both planes. No such effect was, however, found in the uninjured leg or in the control group (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). The inter-group comparisons for these post-exercise measurements showed greater effects in the injured leg than in the control group in average speed in the FP, and a tendency towards greater effects in the other three variables (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref> and Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). This finding indicates that balance standing on one leg may be improved during the recovery period, and that a learning process may be needed in the injured leg after exercise. A different strategy in the injured leg than in the uninjured one has been reported in individuals with ACL injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In that study, Di Fabio et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], found that postural responses, measured with external perturbations while standing on a force platform, could be unilaterally restructured and preprogrammed to compensate for the injury.</p><p>Mechanoreceptors in the ACL contribute to the neuromuscular control of the muscle tonus around the knee joint via the reflex arc (i.e., reflex from joint afferents to the muscle spindles via the gamma motoneurons), and therefore to the stabilization of the knee joint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Decreased proprioception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], increased joint laxity in the knee joint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], and a delay in muscle response in leg muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] have been described after fatiguing exercise. In these studies, uninjured subjects were tested. The activity of joint receptors, muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs may be reduced by fatigue, resulting in proprioceptive deficiency in muscle receptors and loss of muscular reflexes responsible for joint stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Since this afferent information is important for the maintenance of postural control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], this may lead to decreased muscle response and poorer ability to maintain balance. The increase in joint laxity following fatigue has been suggested to be due to reduced muscle tone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], viscoelastic changes in the collagenous tissues of the knee and fatigued muscle stabilizers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and results in inadequate ligament mechanoreceptor feedback, which is required to elicit the muscular reflexes responsible for joint stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. It has been suggested that muscle receptors are the primary determinant of joint position sense, and capsular receptors may have a secondary role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Therefore, the decreased proprioceptive ability following fatigue has been proposed to be due to the decrease in muscle receptor activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Since defects in proprioception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], impaired postural control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], increased joint laxity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and a delay in muscle reaction time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] are present already in an unfatigued state in individuals with ACL injury, they may, at least theoretically, be more affected by fatigue than uninjured subjects. Although we found effects of exercise after a short period of cycling above 60% of the predicted HR<sub>max</sub>, it is possible that greater effects of exercise on balance in single-limb stance may be seen after longer durations of exercise than in the present study. It is also possible that larger effects of exercise may be reflected in more challenging measures of postural control, such as dynamic balance tests. Since, to our knowledge, this is the first study on the effects of fatigue on postural control in patients with ACL injury, the clinical relevance of our results remains unclear. More research is needed to further study whether this may be related to an increased risk of further injuries.</p><p>The lower average speed and lack of difference in DEV 10 in the patients compared to the control group, indicate sway movements at a lower speed with retained amplitudes to be neuromuscular adaptive strategies, rather than more rapid, smaller adjustments (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). These strategies may be the result of decreased proprioception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and a delay in muscle reaction time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], which has been reported after an ACL injury, and thus, these strategies may be needed to generate sufficient afferent impulses to obtain dynamic stabilization of the knee joint. Another possible explanation may be that the patients had all undergone neuromuscular training, which may have affected the strategies of maintaining balance in single-limb stance compared with the control group who had not undergone such training. The clinical relevance of the fact that the patients' post-exercise values approached those of the control group, remains, however, unclear. More research is needed to elucidate this further.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of the present study showed no differences in the effects of exercise between the patients and the controls. However, the injured leg was more affected or tended to be more affected directly after exercise than the control group, which indicates that patients with ACL injury react differently regarding their ability to maintain balance in single-limb stance after short-duration, sub-maximal cycling, than a control group of uninjured subjects. The patients used sway movements at a lower speed with retained amplitudes, which may be an expression of neuromuscular adaptive strategies.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>EA participated in the design of the study, participated in collecting the data, performed the statistical analysis, and drafted the manuscript.
